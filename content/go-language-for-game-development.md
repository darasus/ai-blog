Go is a great language for game development for a number of reasons. First, Go is a compiled language, meaning that it can be run on any platform without the need for a virtual machine. This makes it ideal for games that need to be cross-platform. Second, Go is a very fast language. It is able to compile large programs very quickly, making it ideal for large game projects. Third, Go has excellent support for concurrency. This means that it can handle multiple tasks at the same time, making it perfect for games that need to be responsive to player input. Finally, Go has a very strong standard library. This means that there are already a lot of tools available for game developers to use, making it easier to get started with game development in Go.
