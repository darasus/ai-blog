summary: Go is a programming language developed by Google in 2007. It is a
  general-purpose programming language designed with scalability, ease-of-use,
  and concurrency in mind. Go has many features that make it easier to write and
  read than other compiled languages such as C and C++. The language has been
  open-source since its inception, and has been highly praised by many
  developers. It's a language that was designed to be used in parallel
  programming, which means it’s optimized for working on many things at once.
intro: Now that the world of game development is becoming increasingly more
  digital, there are also new challenges to face. Game developers are now
  expected to come up with solutions to complex problems in record time. And
  this is where programming languages come in. They make it possible for
  developers to solve problems by creating programs directly instead of writing
  instructions word-by-word. There are numerous programming languages out there
  but one that has become particularly useful for game development is Go. It has
  many features that make it an excellent choice for developing video games,
  including its simplicity, type inference, and great support for Unicode. If
  you’re looking to start learning about Go and its benefits for game
  development then keep reading. In this blog post, we’ll be covering all you
  need to know about Go and why it’s a great language for game development

## What is Go?

Go is a programming language developed by Google in 2007. It is a general-purpose programming language designed with scalability, ease-of-use, and concurrency in mind. Go was designed to run efficiently on multi-core processors and be appropriate for concurrent programming across many CPUs and operating systems. It also has a number of language features specifically geared toward making it easier to write concurrent programs.

The language has been open-source since its inception, and has been highly praised by many developers. It has been gaining popularity, especially in the game development industry. It is mostly used on servers (for example, in cloud computing), but it can also be used to create desktop, mobile, and web applications.

## Why Go for Game Development?

Go has a wide range of uses, but one of its main advantages is that it’s a compiled language. This means that it’s not interpreted in real time, like Python or Ruby, which are two other languages that are commonly used for game development. This makes Go perfect for game development because there is no lag in processing. Game engines like Unreal Engine, Godot, and Construct use a compiled language for this exact reason.

Although it’s a compiled language, Go has many features that make it easier to write and read than other compiled languages such as C and C++. This makes it a great language for beginners, but it’s also useful for professional developers. Go also has great support for Unicode and it can be seamlessly integrated with C/C++ code. This makes it a good choice for game development since it can be integrated with game engines.

## Benefits of Using Go for Game Development

There are many reasons why developers are choosing to use Go for game development. Some of the most important ones are:

Ease of learning - Go has a very straightforward syntax, which makes it easy to understand even for new developers. Since it’s a compiled language, it’s not as complicated as other compiled languages like C and C++.

Faster compile times - Compiled languages are compiled because they’re translated into a set of instructions for the computer’s processor that are much shorter and simpler than the code written by a human. This makes them a lot faster to compile. Go compiles significantly faster than most other compiled languages.

Excellent concurrency support - The world of game development is increasingly digital, but it’s also increasingly team-based. This means that many people are working on the same project at the same time. In these situations, it’s important to know how to properly divide tasks between team members to avoid wasting time. Go is a language that was designed to be used in parallel programming, which means that it’s optimized for working on many things at once.

## Cons of Using Go for Game Development

Although Go is a very popular language for game development, it also has some disadvantages:

No generics - Go doesn’t support the use of generics, which is a feature that allows developers to write code that can be reused across different types of data.

No native support for parallelism - This means that parallelism has to be implemented manually. This is something that most developers know how to do, but it’s important to keep in mind when deciding between languages.

The community is relatively small - Although we’ve listed some of Go’s advantages, it doesn’t have as many developers as languages like Python or Ruby. This means that there is a smaller selection of tools, tutorials, and courses specifically for Go. It’s important to keep this in mind when deciding which language to use.

## How to learn Go?

The best way to learn a language is to learn by doing. This means that when you start learning a language, you should focus on applying it to real-world situations as soon as possible. You can do this by building your own side project, or by contributing to an open-source project. This will force you to practice and will help you learn faster than if you just read about the language. Also, don’t forget to practice regularly. It’s easy to forget everything you’ve learned if you don’t use it regularly.

You can start by following the official tutorial at https://golang.org/doc/effective_go. Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you can start practicing by building your own side project or contributing to an open-source project.

## Final words

Go is a great language for game development because of its ease of use, fast compile times, and excellent concurrency support. It has many features that make it particularly well-suited for game development such as its simplicity, type inference, and great support for Unicode.
