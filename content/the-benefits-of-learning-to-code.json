It is the process of learning to think like a programmer. In order to become successful at coding, you must learn how to approach problems from a different perspective. If you\\u2019re a non-coder, you probably think about a problem by asking yourself questions, trying to identify potential solutions, weighing up your options and then implementing the best one. Whereas, if you\\u2019re a coder, you will approach a problem in a different way. You will work out the best solution to the problem by writing code to solve it. In doing so, you are essentially taking information, such as requirements and features, and turning it into a format that a computer can read and understand. This is the main difference between being a non-coder and a coder \\u2013 in one you think out loud, and in the other you think to yourself.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Learning To Code Will Boost Your Career Prospects\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are numerous ways in which learning to code can boost your career prospects.
