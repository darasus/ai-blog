Learning to code is much like learning to ride a bicycle or play an instrument. Although it will take time and effort to master, it is something that the majority of people can learn. The first step to gaining confidence in your abilities is recognizing that everyone started somewhere. No one becomes an expert coder overnight \\u2013 it\\u2019s something that takes time, effort and dedication.

It is the process of learning to think like a programmer. In order to become successful at coding, you must learn how to approach problems from a different perspective. If you\\u2019re a non-coder, you probably think about a problem by asking yourself questions, trying to identify potential solutions, weighing up your options and then implementing the best one. Whereas, if you\\u2019re a coder, you will approach a problem in a different way. You will work out the best solution to the problem by writing code to solve it. In doing so, you are essentially taking information, such as requirements and features, and turning it into a format that a computer can read and understand.
