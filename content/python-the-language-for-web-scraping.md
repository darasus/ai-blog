## Why learn Python for Web Scraping?

There are quite a few programming languages that you can use for web scraping. In fact, many of them are simpler to learn than Python. So why choose Python? Here are a few reasons:

- Python is a general-purpose language - Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide variety of functions, which makes it an excellent choice for web scraping due to its flexibility.

- Python has a large community - Because Python is so widely used, it has a very large and supportive community. This means you can easily find help if you get stuck, attend user-run conferences, or even find a job as a developer!

- Python has many useful scraping libraries - Python also has many libraries that were built with web scraping in mind. This means that it can handle many of the tasks that would require complex code in other languages.

## Why not just use an API?

- Using an API means that you’ll have to wait for the data you request from the website to be released publicly. If you’re working on a time-sensitive project, this could cause major problems.
- APIs have usage limits, which means that if you’re scraping a lot of data, you may run into limits that stop you from continuing. Using web scraping can help you avoid this problem.
- APIs often require authentication, which may be difficult to set up if you’re scraping publicly available data. You may be able to use web scraping to avoid this hassle.

## Getting started with Python for Web Scraping

Now that we’ve discussed a few reasons why you should learn Python for web scraping, let’s talk about how you can actually do it. To get started, you’ll need to make sure you have Python installed. There are many different ways to do this, so make sure to do a bit of research and find the option that’s best for you. Once Python is installed, you can use it to start web scraping.

- To begin, find a website that you want to scrape. When you’re done, follow these steps:
- Open the website in a browser and find the URL for the data you want to scrape.
- Open a Python interpreter and paste the URL into the command prompt.
- Create a new Python file, and then open it in the editor.
- Create a new Python string using “str = “”
- Create a new web scraping instance using “websk = WebScraper()”
- Select the code you want to scrape using “websk.select(“”””)
- Create a new data frame from the data you selected using “df = dataframe()”
- Print the data to the screen using “print(df)”
