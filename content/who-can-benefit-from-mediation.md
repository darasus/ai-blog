summary: Mediation allows divorcing couples to discuss and negotiate issues such
  as child custody and child support, spousal support, distribution of assets,
  and even potential modifications to the terms of their premarital agreement.
  In many states, couples must attend mediation before they can have a civil
  court proceeding. Mediation is an incredibly flexible process that can be
  adapted to suit the needs of the parties involved. It allows each side to be
  heard while encouraging them to listen to the other party, too.
intro: Mediation is a neutral and confidential process that can help people in
  numerous situations. It’s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to
  litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes. Unlike
  arbitration, mediation isn’t binding, which means that if you choose to
  continue with litigation after mediation, you will not be precluded from doing
  so. And while it doesn’t involve a third party making a decision on your case,
  as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest.
  Rather than having another person make the final call about what’s fair,
  mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their
  interests while listening respectfully to the other party’s concerns as well.

## Individuals Going Through Divorce

Divorce is never easy, but mediation can make it less painful. Mediation allows divorcing couples to discuss and negotiate issues such as child custody and child support, spousal support, distribution of assets, and even potential modifications to the terms of their premarital agreement. Going through mediation together can help spouses work together in a neutral environment to come up with solutions that feel mutually beneficial. Moreover, mediation reduces the risk of an expensive and drawn-out court battle. In fact, in many states, couples must attend mediation before they can have a civil court proceeding.

## People Facing Job Loss Or Layoff

If you’re an employee who’s worried about losing your job, or a company that needs to downsize, mediation can help you resolve any issues that might arise out of this difficult situation. If you’re an employee and you’re worried you’ll soon be fired, mediation can help you negotiate a smooth exit. You and your employer can use the mediation process to discuss your future, including topics such as when you will be leaving the company, how much you will be paid, and whether you will be offered a reference letter.

## People With Disabilities Or Illness

If you’re an employee who has a disability or medical condition that prevents you from fulfilling certain job responsibilities, you may need to negotiate an “inability agreement” with your employer. An inability agreement is a contract that outlines the accommodations you need and the modified job responsibilities that your employer will be willing to provide in exchange for you keeping your job. Mediation can help you and your employer reach an agreement that respects your needs while ensuring the employer retains the ability to run a successful business.

## Individuals Who Have Been The Victims Of Abuse

People who have experienced domestic violence or have been abused by a family member or friend often have a hard time negotiating solutions to their situation. In these cases, mediation can help these individuals remove themselves from the environment of abuse while still maintaining control of their situation. Mediation allows victims of abuse to discuss and negotiate a wide range of issues with the abuser, such as the terms of a restraining order, child custody, and even visitation rights with the abuser.

## Small Businesses That Need Help Resolving Contract Disputes

Contract disputes can be especially costly for small businesses, whose financial resources may not be as large as those of larger corporations. In these situations, mediation can help parties agree on a fair settlement, providing a less expensive and more efficient way of handling the dispute than going through the court system.

## Summing Up

When you’ve got a dispute with another party, it’s easy to get caught up in trying to get the upper hand. When mediation is an option, however, it’s important to remember that the goal is not to win but to solve the problem. Mediation is an incredibly flexible process that can be adapted to suit the needs of the parties involved. It allows each side to be heard while encouraging them to listen to the other party, too. With mediation, there are no losers. Everyone involved can walk away feeling like they’ve been given a fair chance to be heard and that they’ve been treated with respect.
