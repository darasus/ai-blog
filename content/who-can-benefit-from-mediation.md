Mediation is a process whereby two parties in conflict attempt to reach a resolution with the help of a third party mediator. Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of all kinds, including but not limited to: family conflict, workplace conflict, landlord-tenant disputes, and community conflict. The mediator facilitates communication between the parties and helps them to identify common ground and areas of agreement. Mediation is a voluntary process and can only take place if both parties agree to participate.

There are many benefits to mediation, including:

1. Mediation is often faster and cheaper than going to court.

2. Mediation is confidential, which means that what is said during mediation cannot be used in court.

3. Mediation allows the parties to have control over the outcome of their dispute.

4. Mediation can improve communication and relationships between the parties.

5. Mediation can help resolve disputes without the need for further legal action.

Who can benefit from mediation?

Almost anyone can benefit from mediation, but it is particularly well-suited for those who are willing to communicate and cooperate in order to reach a resolution. Mediation is an effective way to resolve disputes of all kinds, and can be used in a variety of settings, including families, workplaces, landlords and tenants, and communities.
