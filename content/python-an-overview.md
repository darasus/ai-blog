## What is Python?

Python is an open source programming language that was designed to be readable and easy to understand. It is often used in web development, machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence applications.

As one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world, Python’s versatility has made it a popular choice among software developers and data scientists. It is capable of handling a wide range of applications and is often used in data analysis, data visualization, web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

Python’s use of English-like syntax and its simple structure make it easy to learn and understand for programmers of all skill levels. Its syntax is less formal and rigid than other popular programming languages, such as Java, which may make it easier for beginners to get started with the language.
