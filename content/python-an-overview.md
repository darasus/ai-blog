Python is a programming language with many characteristics, such as an intuitive syntax and powerful data structures, which can lead to efficient code. It's no wonder that this, as well as experienced developers, are benefitting. 

In the Python language, there is an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Python's philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of Perl) in favor of a sparser, less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: "To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."

Python's design philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python, which includes aphorisms such as "Beautiful is better than ugly" and "Explicit is better than implicit".

Python is intended to be a highly readable language. It is sometimes said that Python's readability comes at the expense of its execution speed.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.

Python is a basic calculator out of the box. Just type in expressions to get them evaluated.

>>> 2+2
4
>>> 50-5*6
20
>>> (50-5*6) / 4
5.0
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
