Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third party interference.

Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Ethereum also provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether", which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.

Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. He later went on to found the Ethereum Foundation with others. The development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014. The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins "premined" for the crowdsale. This accounts for approximately 13 percent of the total circulating supply.

In 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains â€“ the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC). The value of the ether token is determined by free market dynamics, while the Ethereum platform itself is run by nodes that are each rewarded for their work with ether.

Ethereum has been used in a variety of pilot projects and proof-of-concepts, ranging from digital identity and documentation to land registries, financial systems, and voting systems. These have included projects such as uPort, an identity management system that allows individuals to sign documents and attestations with their digital signatures; Weifund, a crowdfunding platform; and Boardroom, a voting and governance system for organizations and cooperatives. Notable companies that have built on the Ethereum platform include Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, and Deloitte.
