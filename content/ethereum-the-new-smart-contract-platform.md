summary: Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific
  instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. Smart
  contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this.
  This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract
  will execute automatically without further input from any third party. With
  smart contracts, you can create your own cryptocurrency and issue tokens for
  crowdfunding purposes. The flexibility and customizability of Ethereum’s smart
  contracts make it a very attractive blockchain network.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized computing network built on blockchain technology. It’s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.
Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary. In this article, you’ll learn more about what Ethereum is and its unique benefits as well as potential challenges it faces going forward in adoption and development.

## Ether and Ethereum: What’s the Difference?

Ether and Ethereum are two different things. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain network used to power smart contracts. Ether is the native cryptocurrency used with Ethereum. Ether has a fixed supply of 100 million coins, but Ethereum's network is able to scale according to demand. Ether currently has a total market cap of over $20 billion and is the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. This alone is proof that Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin.
Ethereum's goal is to create a decentralized world computer that can execute any program on a global network. This is possible because Ethereum's network is built with thousands of computers connected together with a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is what executes Ethereum's smart contracts.

## How Does Ethereum Work?

Ethereum's network consists of thousands of computers around the world that use Ethereum's Virtual Machine to execute decentralized apps. Each computer contributes to the network's processing power and also stores a copy of the blockchain that records all Ethereum transactions.
Ethereum's Virtual Machine is run on each node where it executes smart contracts. In order to use the EVM, programmers need to learn a new language called Solidity.

## Unique Benefits of Ethereum

The flexibility and customizability of Ethereum’s smart contracts make it a very attractive blockchain network. Ethereum’s Turing complete programming language means that it can execute any program, which makes it much more useful than other blockchain networks that are limited to specific functions. This also causes Ethereum to be slower than networks without Turing complete programming capabilities, which is why it’s important to acknowledge the tradeoffs.
Ethereum’s tokenization feature is also a huge plus. With Ethereum, you can create your own cryptocurrency and issue tokens for crowdfunding or for any other purpose. This can be especially useful for startups and other projects that want to issue their own token for crowdfunding purposes.

## Drawbacks of Ethereum

Ethereum’s flexibility does come with some downsides. Because Ethereum is more flexible and programmable than other blockchain networks, it is also slower to execute transactions. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin’s blockchain is so much more valuable and widely used. Ethereum’s scalability has been a big issue that the team is currently working to resolve.
Ethereum also uses a lot of energy because mining is so profitable. This is a concern that the network is currently working to address by implementing new Proof of Stake consensus algorithms.

## Bottom line

Ethereum is a decentralized computing network built on blockchain technology. It’s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party.
This flexibility comes with some downsides, such as slower transaction times, but it makes Ethereum a very attractive blockchain network that can execute any program.
