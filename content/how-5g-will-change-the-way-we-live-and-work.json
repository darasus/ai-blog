  "summary": "5G is the next iteration of mobile network technology. It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, but it will require incredibly fast and reliable connectivity to work. 5G will be able to support much more data than 4G, meaning it can upload and stream video far faster than 4Gs. This will enable us to stream Ultra HD video content, such as movies and games, at a much higher standard.",

It will make our devices stronger, more reliable, and more responsive \\u2013 especially when there\\u2019s a lot of demand. Think about the way Times Square is flooded with tourists around the New Year. 4G might have struggled in that situation, but 5G will be able to handle the capacity.

These devices \\u2013 such as sensors placed around a home or a city \\u2013 rely on extremely low latency to function. 5G can offer that kind of quick connection, which will make it the perfect standard for connecting smart cities and self-driving cars. When two devices are communicating via 5G, there\\u2019s usually no more than a few milliseconds between them. This enables them to react extremely quickly and precisely \\u2013 which is essential for both self-driving cars and robotics.

We\\u2019ll also be able to enjoy VR content, such as movies and video games, at a much higher standard.
