These stores often have special deals on certain days of the week or month (such as “XLEND Mondays”). Also, keep in mind that some stores offer special deals at different times throughout the year (such as back-to-school shopping or after Christmas sales).\nEND OF SEASON SALE – Many grocery stores will host sales around the end of each season’s crops: Winter squash, apples, cauliflower, etc. These are also good times to purchase things like onions (which stay fresh longer than other root veggies) and garlic (which lasts longer if stored In a dry location).\nThere are many ways you can access local farmers’ market produce year round! Even if you don't live in an area with a traditional farmers' market or choose not to drive there each week, there's",
  "content": "## SUPERMARKETS\n\nWhen you shop at a supermarket, look at the price per pound on the little stickers on each item. You may find the same item at a lower price per pound! In addition to local produce, many supermarkets now feature produce from other countries or even other continents. You can purchase these in the same way as your local produce.\n\nKeep in mind that when you shop at a supermarket, you may not be getting the freshest produce available. Most of the produce at many supermarkets comes from large produce farms in California or Mexico, where harvesting is more mechanized and designed for efficiency than for flavour or nutrition.\n\nLuckily, there are ways to make sure you’re getting the freshest produce, even if you shop at a supermarket.\n\n- Choose produce that is displayed in clear plastic containers or bins. This way, you can inspect the produce for ripeness yourself, rather than having to rely on the store employees for freshness.\n\n- Choose produce that is in season. Not only is this produce likely to be fresher, but it’s also likely to be less expensive.\n\n## CO-OPS\n\nCo-ops are a great option if you live in an urban or suburban area, or if you are unable to foster a relationship with a farmer. Co-ops can vary, but typically they are groups of people who get together to purchase food and other items in bulk at better prices than they would be able to get on their own.\nCo-op members often have the option of ordering their food online or visiting the store to shop. There may also be a drop-off option so you can order your items and then pick them up at another location.\nWhen visiting a co-op, look for produce that’s labeled with a harvest date. This will give you an idea of how fresh your produce is. Other fresh food items to look for include eggs (preferably from chickens that are pasture-raised), nuts, seeds, honey, and herbs.\n\n## FARMERS’ MARKETS (online or in-person)\n\nFarmers’ markets are a great way to buy local produce. The key is to know how to choose the best produce and how to store it so it lasts.\nFarmers’ markets are a great place to start for anyone new to buying produce. You can ask the vendors for advice on how to select the produce and how to store and prepare it.\nYou can also visit your library or bookstore and check out books on how to choose and store fresh produce.\n\nKeep in mind that produce selection at a farmers’ market is likely to vary from week to week, so if you see something you like, you should buy it as soon as possible and store it properly so that it lasts longer.\n\n## ONLINE VENDORS & BOX SHIPMENTS\n\nBuying produce online has a few advantages over buying produce at a farmers’ market or supermarket. First, the quality is likely to be higher. You can also order when you want your produce, rather than having to wait for a farmers’ market to open or a supermarket to have its next sale.\nThese vendors have agreements with local farmers to bring their produce to market, so you know you’re getting produce that’s as fresh as possible. This means that the produce is likely to be tastier and packed with more nutrients.\nYou can usually select the types of produce you want to receive and the frequency of your shipments. Boxes usually include enough produce for several meals.\n\n## GROCERS & FRESH MARKETS\n\nIf you’re looking for the freshest produce, then you’re going to want to visit your local grocer or fresh market.\n\nVisit the produce department and ask an employee for advice on how to select the freshest produce. Look for signs that indicate the produce is “fresh from the field” (vs. “mature and ready to be harvested”).\nYou can also bring your own produce to compare it to the stuff they have available. This can be a good way to get the most out of your money.\n\nIf you’re in a larger city, you may have access to Asian or Hispanic markets. These markets may have a wider selection of produce than your typical grocer.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIt can be confusing to know exactly where to find these healthy foods and how they can fit into your budget. Luckily there are many ways to access local farmers’ market produce year round!"
