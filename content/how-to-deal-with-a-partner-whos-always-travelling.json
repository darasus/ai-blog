You might be surprised to find that your partner has been feeling just as frustrated as you have about it.\n\n## Focus On What You Have, Not What You Don’t\n\nWhen you’re in a committed relationship, it’s easy to get caught up in what you don’t have. You might think about how your partner isn’t around to do things with you or how you don’t get to spend as much time with them as you’d like.\nWhen you start to focus on what you don’t have, it can make you feel a lot of resentment towards your partner. It can be easy to blame your partner for being gone so often, but it only leads to trouble.\nInstead of dwelling on what you don’t have, focus on what you do have. Think about the good times you’ve had with your partner or the things that make your relationship strong.

They’re just trying to make a living for both of you.\n\n## Ask Your Partner What Makes Them Feel Loved\n\nYou know your partner better than anyone else. But you also need to remember that your partner knows you better than anyone else, too. If you’re wondering how to make your partner feel loved while they’re away, ask them.\nTry to put yourself in your partner’s shoes. Think about what they might need from you while they’re away that you could provide.\nIf you want to make your partner feel loved while they’re away, you have to ask them what they need.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThere are some challenges to dating someone who travels frequently. They’re usually far outweighed by the benefits of being with them, though.\nIf you want to be with someone who travels for work, you have to be willing to accept that it will be a big part of their life. You can’t expect your partner to completely stop travelling just because you want them to.\nIf you can accept that, you can find a way to make it work and have a stronger, more meaningful relationship when your partner comes home."
