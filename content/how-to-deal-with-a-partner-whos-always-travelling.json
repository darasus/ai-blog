It can be super easy to fall into a routine when you\\u2019re spending so much time with each other. You go to work, come home, and then retreat to your respective rooms for the rest of the night. And while that routine is totally normal and understandable at this stage in your relationship, it might not be exactly what you\\u2019re looking for.\nIt\\u2019s easy to get jealous or resentful if your partner is always on their computer \\u2014 but that doesn\\u2019t mean that there isn\\u2019t a reason for their constant use of it. It could be that they are really passionate about something they\\u2019re researching online or maybe they have an online business venture they\\u2019ve been working on for a while now. However, if this is causing tension between you two, speak up! They may not even realize how much time they spend on their computer and just how much of an impact it has on your relationship.

It\\u2019s a way of resolving disputes that is less adversarial than litigation and usually cheaper, faster, and more private than other methods. Mediation is also collaborative as well as neutral. The mediator acts as a neutral party who helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable manner.\nIn mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It\\u2019s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It\\u2019s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them.
