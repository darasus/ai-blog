  for themselves. They are also quite independent and can often hide any health

  exposure to other cats, as well as the general stressors of everyday life,
  even the happiest cat is bound to get sick once in a while.

## Parasites

Parasites are a very common cat health problem that can affect any species of animal. However, cats are especially prone to infestation due to their frequent hunting and scavenging habits. Because parasites can be transmitted from host to host, they are also common in the animal shelter setting. Cats can be infested with anything from worms to fleas and ticks.
If you are planning on bringing a new feline friend home, you should watch out for signs of parasites like worms in the stool, hair loss on the lower back, and the presence of scabs and sores caused by fleas.
If you have an infestations, you may also see your cat scratching excessively, eating a lot, or losing weight too quickly.
Antiparasitic medications are available for all kinds of worms and other parasites. Be sure to talk to your vet about which ones are right for your cat’s situation.

## Diet and Nutrition Issues

Cats are natural carnivores and they thrive best on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. While it is possible to feed your cat a vegetarian or vegan diet, it can cause a host of nutritional issues. Additionally, many commercial cat foods are high in carbohydrates and low in protein, which can also cause problems. If you notice any of these common cat health problems, your cat may be suffering from nutritional deficiencies:

- Loss of appetite
- Excessive thirst
- Weakness
- Weight loss/Loss of body mass
- Lethargy
- Poor hair growth and skin conditions

Most of these conditions can be quickly resolved with the reintroduction of a high-protein diet. Be sure to talk to your vet about the best diet for your cat.

## Urinary Tract Problems

Cats are known for their strong and powerful bladders. Unfortunately, this also means that they are prone to having issues with their urinary tracts. The most common cat health problems caused by an inflamed or infected UT are frequent urination, blood in the urine, and painful urination.
Urinary tract infections may be caused by bacteria in the bladder or in the environment where the litter box is kept. Other causes can be a metabolic disorder or a reaction to certain medications.
Urinary tract infections can be treated with antibiotics, but it is important to treat the underlying cause as well. If left untreated, a UT infection can cause a blockage in the bladder and become life-threatening.

## Ear Infections

Cats are natural hunters and their bodies are made to deal with dirt and grime. Unfortunately, this often means that they get ear mites and other debris in their ears. This can cause ear infections, which are the most common cat health problems caused by ear mites. Other issues that can be caused by ear mites are scratching at the ears, hair loss, and a foul smell.
Ear mites are very common in kittens and cats, and can be treated medically or with natural ear cleaning products. Be sure to check your cat’s ears regularly and clean them if you notice any signs of ear mites.
If you notice frequent scratching at the ears, a foul smell, or hair loss, you should take your cat to the vet as soon as possible to get the ear infection resolved.

## Dental Problems in Cats

Cats are known for their strong, powerful teeth, which they use to kill their prey. Unfortunately, this also means that they are prone to dental issues, especially when they are fed dry food as opposed to wet food.
Dry food often contains a lot of calcium, which can cause plaque and tartar buildup on your cat’s teeth, leading to painful infections and gingivitis.
If you notice any of the following signs of dental problems in your cat, it’s time to get them to the vet:

- Bad breath
- Excessive drooling
- Excessive chewing on things other than their toys
- Reduced appetite
- Weight loss

## Behavior Changes Due to Health Issues

Behavioral changes are one of the most common cat health problems that people mistake for something else entirely.
If you notice that your normally playful cat is suddenly not interested in the catnip, or your usually friendly kitten is now aggressively attacking the family, it could be a sign of something much more serious.
If you have noticed a behavioral change in your cat, it’s a good idea to take it to the vet for an examination.
Diseases like kidney failure, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism can all cause behavioral changes in your cat. It’s important to look out for these common cat health problems and get your cat to the vet as soon as possible if you notice a change.

## Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)

FIV is a disease that is commonly misconstrued as a form of cancer or leukemia. Although it is not uncommon for cats to be diagnosed with both FIV and leukemia, it is important to note the difference between the two.
FIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, while leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the blood. FIV cannot be cured, but it can be managed with medication and a healthy lifestyle. It is a relatively common cat health problem, especially in shelters.
If you have adopted a new cat from a shelter, be sure to have it tested for FIV. This will help you to plan the best course of treatment for your feline friend.

## Flea-Borne Illnesses in Cats

Cats are not the definitive host for fleas, but they are carriers of certain diseases that are transmitted by the fleas.
Unfortunately, there are very few flea-control options available for cats. That being said, there are some steps you can take to protect your cat from flea-borne illnesses:

- Keep your home clean and vacuum frequently.
- Use insecticides to kill fleas in your home.
- Use flea collars to protect your cat from fleas outside.

All of these steps will protect your cat from some of the diseases that are transmitted by fleas, like tapeworms. However, it’s important to remember that there is no 100% effective way to protect your cat from fleas.

When your vet examines your cat, they will be able to determine what the issue is and provide the best possible care. From parasites to cancer, these 10 common cat health problems can be treated with the right diagnosis and care.
