summary: If you have to travel to work every day, you might be able to get a bit
  more out of your commute. Plan your route to work or home so that it passes by
  a walking trail or a park. You can also try walking up stairs or taking the
  stairs instead of the elevator or the escalator when you can. If you can, try
  to walk with someone who can keep you company and help you stay focused on the
  walk, rather than what you’re eating. Keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand
  to keep you energized.
intro: It’s the perfect way to be active without having to think too much about

  quite the challenge, especially if you don’t have a gym membership or access
  to any other kind of workout facilities.However, as with anything else in life
  that may seem difficult at first but is actually beneficial for your
  well-being in the long run, there are plenty of ways to make walking more
  accessible and enjoyable for you. Here are some tips on how you can get
  started on that walking routine and keep it going...

## Make the most of your commute.

If you have to travel to work every day, you might be able to get a bit more out of your daily commute than just feeling frustrated. If you plan your route to work or home so that it passes by a walking trail or a park, you can get some valuable exercise in as you head to and from work. You can also try walking up stairs or taking the stairs instead of the elevator or the escalator when you can. You may not be able to walk for a long period of time during your commute (especially if you’re taking public transport), but you can still make it count towards your daily physical activity goal.

Reimagine your commute as a time for you to catch up on some reading, listen to some podcasts, or connect with loved ones through phone calls or video calls. With some focus on what you’re doing, you might be surprised at how quickly the time will pass by, and you’ll be one step closer to work. If you can, try to avoid driving to and from work as much as possible. Driving places may seem like it would take less time than walking, but it’s been found that people who walk to work actually get there faster on average than those who drive.

## Plan a route that’ll keep you walking.

If you’re trying to get more active and you’ve always enjoyed walking, then you might find the idea of a walking route appealing. But you might also find yourself wondering, “what do I walk?” And “for how long?” There aren’t any set rules on what types of routes you should choose or how often you should walk them, but you can think of it as a bit like running a business. Plan what your route is going to be, how long you plan on walking it, and try to make it worth your while. Keep track of how many hours you’ve been walking, how far you’ve gone, and what your average pace has been. You might be surprised by what you discover about your walking patterns.

## Keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand.

If you’ve been walking for long enough, you may have noticed that hunger usually comes around about one to two hours after you start to walk. It’s important to keep in mind that walking burns calories, but it doesn’t provide the same amount of energy that an average workout does. This is why those who walk for long periods of time may find themselves becoming hungry sooner than they would during other kinds of exercise. If you want to make sure you stay energized during your walks, try keeping a supply of healthy snacks on hand. This can help you avoid becoming worn out while walking, as well as help you avoid the mistake of walking on an empty stomach.

Taking care of your body is important and eating while walking is OK, but make sure you don’t try to eat while you’re driving in order to avoid accidents. If you can, try to walk with someone who can keep you company and help you stay focused on the walk, rather than what you’re eating. This can help you stay safe while you’re out and about and can also help you avoid distractions that could lead you to overeat.

## Set small, attainable goals for yourself.

Even if you just started walking or you’ve been walking for a while, you can work towards setting goals for yourself that can help you get even more out of walking. Make sure your goals are attainable and easy to track, and they should be focused on things like duration, pace, distance, and/or intensity. There are plenty of ways to get creative with your goals, but here are a few examples:

- Set a distance goal: Try walking for a specific length of time or walk a certain distance, such as a 5K (3.1 miles). This can help you track your progress over time and can be a great way to challenge yourself.

- Set a speed goal: Try walking at a certain pace for a certain length of time. This could be walking as fast as you can for a mile, or it could be walking at a brisk pace for 30 minutes.

- Set an intensity goal: This may be the hardest of the three to track, but it’s still possible. You could try walking for 30 minutes at a certain intensity level, or you could try walking for 30 minutes and trying to maintain a certain heart rate level. This is a great way to get a more comprehensive workout and track how your body responds over time.

## Try walking with a friend or two.

If you’re feeling like you’d like to get out more, meet some new people, and have some fun while being active, you can try walking with a friend or two. You could walk with someone in your neighborhood, at work, in your city, or wherever you’re comfortable doing so. This can be a great way to get out of your comfort zone and also have fun while doing so. You can plan routes or simply walk wherever you’re at. You can even bring a friend or two with you to a walking event or a walk-friendly area in your city.

This can be a great way to stay accountable to your walking goals and can help you push yourself a bit further when you might otherwise feel like slacking off. It can also help you meet new people who may share some interests with you. You can also try walking with a friend or two online through apps or web platforms that allow you to connect with others. You can then participate in challenges against one another or just encourage each other to stay active in a fun way.

## Don’t be afraid to switch up your routine.

Some people prefer to stick to walking on a route that they love and have been doing for a while, but you can also try to switch up your route occasionally and try some different approaches. This can help you keep things interesting and can help you avoid getting bored with your routine. If you find yourself feeling tired or bored with your route, try to find ways to shake things up so that you don’t get too comfortable or let yourself become complacent. You can try finding new routes, trying walking at different times of the day, or just trying to change up the way you do your route.

The best way to keep yourself engaged with your walking is to try new things, push yourself, and have fun while doing so. This can help you avoid feeling too bored or repetitive while still getting the benefits of walking.

## Conclusion

Walking is a great way to get active and stay active, and it’s something that can be done by almost anyone at any time. However, it can be hard to get started, especially if you don’t have a routine or a plan.

The best way to get started is to make the most of your commute, plan a route that’ll keep you walking, keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand, set small, attainable goals for yourself, try walking with a friend or two, and don’t be afraid to switch up your routine.
