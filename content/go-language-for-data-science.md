summary: Go is an open source programming language that was designed by Google
  engineers in 2009. It aims to solve the problems of large software projects,
  such as code maintenance and scalability, that developers faced when working
  in other languages. Go’s high-level standard libraries, designed for
  general-purpose programming, are easy to understand and follow standardized
  conventions. Go has a static type system with no explicit types, making the
  language less error-prone. Go also has a very fast compilation time, making it
  a good choice when you need to deploy code often.
intro: >-
  Data scientists must be able to cope with new challenges quickly. If you
  want your team to be able to respond immediately and pivot smoothly, you need
  them to use the same toolkit, share libraries and work on one codebase as much
  as possible. There are so many different tools for data science, from Python
  libraries like pandas and NumPy to the Scala programming language for
  statistical analysis. 

  If your team consists of engineers who are also experienced data scientists, then you can choose any solution that fits both requirements. However, if you have data scientists who are not programmers or engineers who need to get up-to-speed fast, it’s best to choose a solution that offers multiple benefits at once. Go is an increasingly popular solution that combines the ease of scripting languages with the performance of compiled languages. In this article, we will learn about why you should use Go as a data science language and what its main benefits are.

## What is Go?

Go is an open source programming language that was designed by Google engineers in 2009. It aims to solve the problems of large software projects, such as code maintenance and scalability, that developers faced when working in other languages. Go’s high-level standard libraries, designed for general-purpose programming, are easy to understand and follow standardized conventions. This makes it easy to read and understand other developers’ code. It also makes it easier to write quality code that is clear and concise.

Go has a static type system with no explicit types. This makes the language less error-prone, as it can catch bugs that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. A static type system is also helpful when integrating Go with other languages, as it can check and understand types from other languages. Go also has a very fast compilation time, making it a good choice when you need to deploy code often. It can also run on many different platforms, including Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Good for Data Science Beginners

One of the reasons for data scientists to choose Go over other languages is its simplicity and straightforward syntax. This is a plus for new data scientists who are not used to writing code in other languages. A simpler language means less focus on syntax and more focus on the actual analysis. New data scientists can get up-and-running fast and focus on the important stuff.

Go is also a compiled programming language and not a scripting language, like Python. This means that it is converted into machine code, which can run very fast. This is very helpful for data scientists who often work with large datasets, since it can process them much faster than a scripting language like Python.

## Good for Engineers and Data Scientists

Engineers who are familiar with programming in Go will be able to easily understand code written by other engineers who use it. This is an important benefit that makes it easier to collaborate across teams. It also makes it easier to onboard new engineers who can focus on the functionality of the code and not try to learn the language itself.

Another reason why engineers and data scientists would choose Go is the fact that it can be used in many different fields. This makes it a versatile language that can be used with different tools and solutions.

## Good for Fast Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment, which means releasing new software on a very frequent basis, is the norm in modern software development. It has been proven that releasing more often is better for customer satisfaction and managing bugs. With Go, you can release code faster, since compilation is very quick and code changes are automatic. The fact that Go is compiled is also a positive, since compiled languages are generally faster than scripting languages.

## Good for Collaboration and Sharing

Since Go is statically typed and compiled, it is very easy to share libraries and code between developers. This is helpful when you have a data science team that needs to collaborate a lot, since it is easier to understand and use other people’s code. It is also easier for other teams to use your code, since it is available as a library.

## Summary

Go is a compiled language that is designed for general-purpose programming. It was created and designed by Google engineers, who wanted to solve the problems of large software projects, like code maintenance and scalability. One of the reasons why data scientists would choose Go is its simplicity and straightforward syntax. This is a plus for new data scientists who are not used to writing code in other languages. Go is also a compiled language and not a scripting language, like Python. This means that it is converted into machine code, which can run very fast. This is very helpful for data scientists who often work with large datasets. Engineers and data scientists who are familiar with programming in Go will be able to easily understand code written by other engineers who use it. This is an important benefit that makes it easier to collaborate across teams. Go is also versatile and can be used in many different fields, making it a useful language that can be used with different tools and solutions.
