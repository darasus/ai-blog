## Why meal plan?

Meal planning is an essential part of healthy eating and living. When you’re meal planning, you’re in control of your diet. You’re in control of your health. You’re in control of your finances too. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be expensive. It can be easy on your wallet if you know how to shop and cook efficiently.
Meal planning allows you to take note of your food inventory. You can see what you have on hand, what you need to buy, and what you need to use up before it expires. Knowing what’s in your pantry and fridge will help you avoid wasting food and money. Wasted food is wasted cash. You can avoid this problem by meal planning.
Meal planning will also help you avoid the temptation of eating out. When you’re in the kitchen, you see what needs to be done. This will help you stay away from the takeout menu. And if you need help avoiding the allure of your favourite takeout spot, you can use a food delivery app like Foodora to order healthy meals.

## The benefits of meal planning

Meal planning gives you the opportunity to make healthier choices. Whether you’re shopping for fresh produce or ordering takeout, you have the ability to make healthier choices. Meal planning will help you avoid the temptation of nipping out for fast food or grabbing a snack from the vending machine. And these calories add up over time. Be mindful of the foods you’re eating, the amount of servings you’re consuming, and the nutritional values of these foods.
While you can’t control how much you’re actually chewing, you can control what’s going into your body. You can do this by meal planning.

## Make it a habit

If you’re new to meal planning, you might find it challenging to make it a part of your weekly routine. This is completely normal. We’re all creatures of habit. Some of us are morning people. And others are night owls. It takes time to find the perfect rhythm that works best for you.

Keep in mind that it’s not a race. It’s something you should be enjoying. Find something that will make meal planning fun. You might try cooking with your kids or invite a friend to join you in the kitchen.

## Commit to the Saturday shake-up

You might have heard that every seven years you should completely overhaul your home. But what about your diet? If you’re someone who is constantly trying new diets or completely overhauling your diet, you might be doing more harm than good.
While it’s great to be committed to eating healthy, you don’t want the diet to consume your life. This can be a sign that you need to shake up your diet. You should be able to eat the foods you love and still be able to achieve your health goals.
That’s where the Saturday shake-up comes in. On Saturday, shake up your meal plan for the week. If you’re someone who always tries new diets, you might find that you get bored of eating the same ole thing. The Saturday shake-up gives you the opportunity to eat some of your favourite foods but in a healthier way.

Leftovers can be a great way to save money and eat healthier. But some people are ashamed to eat leftovers. If you’re one of these people, it’s time to get over it and embrace leftovers. You can use leftovers in a variety of ways.
