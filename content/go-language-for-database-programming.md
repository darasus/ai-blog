## What is Go?

Go is a programming language that is designed to be simple to use, secure, and efficient. It was first released in 2009. The language is open source and was designed by a team at Google with assistance from the open source community. Go was created because its creators believed that an efficient language that was easy to use could help advance computing significantly. The language is intended to be used for a wide variety of applications, from systems programming to web development. It has been used to create applications such as Kubernetes, Docker, and the Hugo web engine.

Go is designed to be easy to read and understand, even if you aren’t familiar with the language. It is a strongly typed language with automatic memory management and a focus on simplicity. It has great support for strings, regular expressions, and concurrency.

## Why use Go to create databases?

Go was built for simplicity and ease of use, and the majority of database programmers report that it meets those goals. This programming language is a great choice for any database developer who wants to create a simple database. It’s also a good option for programmers who want to create a database that can scale well and handle high loads. When you use Go to create a database, you can access the full power of the programming language’s core features. This means that you can work with any type of data, use Go’s built-in concurrency primitives, and build high-quality software.

## Go and Databases: A Great Combination

One of the reasons that Go is such a great choice for database programming is that it has special built-in support for databases. The language’s core libraries include special support for creating and managing connections to a variety of databases. This built-in support makes it easy to create and use databases with Go, and it also allows you to create applications that are easier to maintain and scale. If you want to create databases with Go, you’ll need to use the Go language and its core libraries. You can’t use a database language or tool with Go. You can use any database that has a driver available for Go. The most commonly used databases for Go include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. For many developers, the most difficult part of using Go for database programming is deciding which database to use.

## Pros of using Go for database programming

If you decide to use Go for database programming, you’ll have many advantages. One of the best things about this programming language is that it is simple and straightforward. This makes it easy to learn and easy to use. Many database programmers report that they can create software that meets their needs by using Go, even if they have very little experience with this language. Since Go is a compiled language, it also offers the speed that can be challenging to achieve with a scripting language like Python or Ruby.

## Cons of Using Go for Database Programming

If you are considering using Go for database programming, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. One issue is that, as of 2019, there are few commercial databases with drivers available for Go. This means that you may have a limited set of options when choosing a database to use with your Go application. Another potential challenge is that Go doesn’t have any special support for NoSQL databases. This means that you may have to use an external library or wrapper to connect to your NoSQL database.

## Conclusion

If you are looking for a new programming language to use for database development, Go is worth considering. This language is simple and straightforward, making it easy to learn and use. Many database programmers also report that it is easy to create powerful applications with Go. This means that it is a great choice for both beginners and experienced database programmers.
