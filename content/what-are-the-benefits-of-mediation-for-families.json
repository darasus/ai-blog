Mediation can help preserve the relationship between the spouses as they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions. Mediation is often cheaper than litigation because there is no legal bill for depositions, court reporter fees, or other litigation expenses. It's important for divorcing couples to realize that a settlement on these issues is not a punishment for one spouse or an award to the other.",

Divorce has a negative connotation because it is associated with the dissolution of a relationship, which is something that is naturally filled with lots of love, hopes, and dreams for the future. It\\u2019s a sad and unfortunate situation that usually has no winners in it. When a couple files for divorce, they are ending their relationship. Even though one or both of the spouses may have wanted the divorce and initiated it, they are still very much affected by the emotions and feelings that are associated with ending a relationship, especially if there are children involved. The issues surrounding filing for divorce are far from black and white. There are often multiple sides to each issue that have been debated and discussed by the spouses for months or even years before they decide to file for divorce.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Is Mediation A Good Choice?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation offers an alternative to a court battle and often results in an agreement that is more fair and equitable than what might be ordered by a judge.

In court, one side often wins and the other loses. In mediation, both sides walk away feeling like they have gained something. Mediation is often cheaper than litigation because there is no legal bill for depositions, court reporter fees, or other litigation expenses. Mediation is also more private than litigation.

Such legal action is often the last resort in a long process that has gone on for months or even years as the couple struggles to agree on issues concerning their children, finances, and other aspects of their relationship. Mediation may help preserve the relationship between the spouses as they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions. Mediation encourages spouses to be open-minded and flexible. It encourages them to seek solutions that are fair and equitable to both of them rather than fighting for what they want regardless of the cost to their spouse.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mediation Can Help Settle Child Custody And Child Support Issues\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Issues concerning the children are often the most difficult for divorcing couples to resolve.
