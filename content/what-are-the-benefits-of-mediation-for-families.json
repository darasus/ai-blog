Divorce has a negative connotation because it is associated with the dissolution of a relationship, which is something that is naturally filled with lots of love, hopes, and dreams for the future. It\\u2019s a sad and unfortunate situation that usually has no winners in it. When a couple files for divorce, they are ending their relationship. Even though one or both of the spouses may have wanted the divorce and initiated it, they are still very much affected by the emotions and feelings that are associated with ending a relationship, especially if there are children involved. The issues surrounding filing for divorce are far from black and white. There are often multiple sides to each issue that have been debated and discussed by the spouses for months or even years before they decide to file for divorce.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Is Mediation A Good Choice?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation offers an alternative to a court battle and often results in an agreement that is more fair and equitable than what might be ordered by a judge. Mediation often leads to quicker settlements than litigation. Because the mediator\\u2019s role is to help the parties find common ground, mediation can lead to settlements that please both sides. In court, one side often wins and the other loses. In mediation, both sides walk away feeling like they have gained something.

Mediation may help preserve the relationship between the spouses as they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions. Mediation encourages spouses to be open-minded and flexible.
