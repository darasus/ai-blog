Divorce has a negative connotation because it is associated with the dissolution of a relationship, which is something that is naturally filled with lots of love, hopes, and dreams for the future. It\\u2019s a sad and unfortunate situation that usually has no winners in it. When a couple files for divorce, they are ending their relationship. Even though one or both of the spouses may have wanted the divorce and initiated it, they are still very much affected by the emotions and feelings that are associated with ending a relationship, especially if there are children involved. The issues surrounding filing for divorce are far from black and white.

In court, one side often wins and the other loses. In mediation, both sides walk away feeling like they have gained something.

Mediation may help preserve the relationship between the spouses as they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions.

It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
