intro: "Are you an exceptional programmer? Sure, you can code in multiple
  programming languages fluently, debug any issues you encounter, and implement
  algorithms like a pro. But what happens when your code crashes again and
  again? Or it works perfectly on paper but not in practice? What do you do when
  you have no idea what’s going wrong or why the code isn’t working as intended?
  Well, if that sounds like you — as a programmer — then keep reading because we
  have some good news for you! Debugging your code is one of the most
  challenging and demanding tasks as a coder. It requires patience, precision,
  and analytical skills to identify where things aren’t working correctly and
  why. However, with the right strategies and techniques, debugging your code
  doesn’t need to be a painful process. Here are some helpful tips on how to
  debug your code like a pro:"

## Kano Analysis

This is a great way to understand what’s broken in your code. It also helps you to determine which things are important to fix and which ones aren’t as urgent.
This is a 5-stage model of product satisfaction. It was developed by Professor Noriaki Kano as a way to organize customer expectations of what a product will do for them.

Stage 1 - Basic requirements - These are the basic features that need to be implemented in order for the product to be considered useful. For example, a calculator needs to perform calculations, an alarm needs to sound, a door needs to keep the weather out, a computer needs to store and access data.

Stage 2 - Delighters - Delighters are additional features that surpass customer expectations and make the product more useful. A calculator that can store all the equations you’ve used in a session is a delighter. An alarm that can be snoozed and reminds you of a meeting is a delighter. A door that can be opened remotely is a delighter. A computer that can sync between multiple devices and has a built-in spell checker is a delighter.

Stage 3 - Necessities - These are features that help solve a specific problem. For example, a calculator that can save past calculations, a calculator with a history feature, is a necessity. An alarm that can be set to go off at a specific time is a necessity. A door that can be locked and unlocked remotely is a necessity. A computer that can run multiple programs at once is a necessity.

Stage 4 - Wants - These are features that are nice to have but aren’t essential. For example, an alarm that can play music, a calculator that can perform advanced functions, a door that can change colors according to the season, a computer that can predict the weather.

Stage 5 - Frustration - A feature that is missing, broken, or doesn’t work as expected.

## Read The Logs

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving issues in your code. However, before you can fix it, you must know what’s broken and why. This is where reading the logs comes in.

When errors occur, your code generates logs using console.log() or another logging method. These are useful because they tell you what has gone wrong. The logs also include information on how to fix it.
The conventional way to retrieve logs is to open a browser and view the browser console. But there are multiple ways to do this. You can use console logging software like Tailor or Logging You can also use an app on your phone or computer.

## Divide And Conquer

This is a powerful method of problem-solving that can also be used to debug your code.
In debugging, you need to break your code into small, isolated tasks that can easily be tested. Once you have implemented a few smaller segments of code, you can test them one at a time to see how they work together and if they are complete.
Once you’ve confirmed that these segments work, you can link them together to form the full code. This is an effective strategy for debugging your code because it keeps you from getting overwhelmed and stressed.

## Black Box Testing

When debugging your code, you must take into account all aspects of your code — inputs, processing, and outputs. You must test to ensure that all of these are functioning correctly.

Inputs are any information that your code is receiving from an external source. For example, you can input a value into your code to see if it is accurate. You can also input values that make sense but are outside the expected range to see if your code will handle those correctly.

Processing is the way your code takes this input and uses it to produce an output. You can test your processing by providing inputs that make sense and valid ones to see if they are being processed correctly.

Outputs are the final state of your code once it has processed the inputs. Again, you can test the outputs by providing inputs that make sense and valid ones to see if they are being processed correctly.

## Bottom-Up Debugging

This is a great strategy for debugging your code. You can also use it for testing your code to ensure that it’s working correctly.

Debugging and testing your code from the bottom up means starting from the most basic components of your code and building up from there. This is the opposite of top-down debugging, which starts from the top of the code and works down to the basic components.

This is a particularly useful strategy for debugging complex code. It gives you a better understanding of how each section of your code works and how it affects the rest of the code.

This debugging strategy is also helpful for testing your code, as it gives you a better understanding of how your code works and what it is supposed to do.

## Conclusion

Debugging your code can be a frustrating and challenging process — especially if you’re not sure how to get started. To debug your code like a pro, it’s important to know what to look for and what to do when you encounter issues.

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues in your code. To debug your code, you must first break your code into smaller segments, test them, and then link them together to form the full code.

Knowing what to look for and how to identify issues in your code is the first step to debugging. Once you know what’s broken, you can implement strategies and techniques to fix it.
