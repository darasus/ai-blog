summary: Pure Comedy is an ambitious, wide-ranging statement that is
  well-conceived, deftly executed and persistently compelling. The songs are
  wonderfully varied and sonically expansive, thanks to the assistance of
  producer Jonathan Wilson, and the lyrics are consistently incisive and
  insightful. The music, on the other hand, reflects the chaos of an existence
  driven by consumerism, vanity, and instant gratification. The album opens with
  the sound of a cash register and a voice intoning, “Welcome to the comedy
  show.” It’s a multi-genre parade of human absurdity.

## The best album of 2017?

Pure Comedy is a hilarious masterpiece. It’s an ambitious, wide-ranging statement that is well-conceived, deftly executed and persistently compelling. The songs are wonderfully varied and sonically expansive, thanks to the assistance of producer Jonathan Wilson, and the lyrics are consistently incisive and insightful. But most impressively, this album is unapologetically funny. It’s dark, but not grim. It’s cynical, but not hopeless. It’s dramatic, but not overwrought. It’s clever, but not glib. It’s satirical, but not mean. It’s nuanced, but not pedantic. It’s insightful, but not pretentious. It’s critical, but not condemning. It’s challenging, but not didactic. It’s thoughtful, but not detached.

## A multi-genre parade of human absurdity

Father John Misty has the unique ability to make the absurd seem real and the real seem absurd. His lyrics speak with incisive clarity about the absurdity of modern life. The music, on the other hand, reflects the chaos of an existence driven by consumerism, vanity, and instant gratification. It’s a multi-genre parade of human absurdity. There’s country, there’s folk, there’s pop, there’s rock, there’s rhythm and blues, there’s jazz, there’s no wave, there’s electro-funk and there’s even a little hardcore. And somehow it all makes sense. The album opens with the sound of a cash register and a voice intoning, “Welcome to the comedy show.”

## It’s an ambitious, wide-ranging statement

Father John Misty (aka former Fleet Foxes drummer-turned-singer-songwriter J. Tillman) has become the master of the catchy, scathing one-liner. He combines this with an expansive, exploratory and thoroughly contemporary sonic palette that’s not unlike what you’d hear on an LCD Soundsystem album. But where that band’s James Murphy might be content to let a single idea simmer for three or four minutes, Tillman is a more expansive and exploratory writer. Each song on this album is its own mini-concept album, but each one also contributes to the larger narrative arc that runs through the album. It’s an sprawling, ambitious, wide-ranging statement that is unrelenting in its pursuit of clarity.

## It’s a challenging, thoughtful and nuanced album

Father John Misty is playful, but not frivolous; challenging, but not pedantic; thoughtful, but not detached; critical, but not condemning; nuanced, but not pedantic. This album is also funny, but not glib; dramatic, but not overwrought; and satirical, but not mean. It’s an enjoyable and entertaining listen, but it’s also a challenging, thoughtful and nuanced album.

## Conclusion

This is an album that demands to be listened to all the way through, and demands to be heard with attention and focus. And yet it’s also an album that rewards repeated listens. It’s the rare album that feels like a breath of fresh air upon first listen, but then becomes something even more significant upon subsequent listens. This is an album that will stand the test of time, and that will only grow in significance and stature with each successive year.
