  "title": "The Benefits Of A Plant-based Diet",
  "summary": "A plant-based diet is a type of dietary pattern that focuses primarily on whole plants such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, and grains. The benefits include improved digestive health, reduced risk of certain cancers, and better management of chronic conditions. Plant-based diets can also help with weight management and be protective against type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and hypertension. An important advantage is that it can help people manage conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.",
  "intro": "There is increasing awareness among people about the benefits of a plant-based diet. Many people seem to be transitioning to a vegetarian or vegan diet for health reasons. Some are also taking up this diet to offset the effects of climate change and reduce their carbon footprint. \nA plant-based diet involves consuming plants as primary food sources rather than animal products. Apart from being rich in vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, plant-based diets have been linked to numerous health benefits — lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer; higher intake of antioxidants and fiber; lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels; and better management of chronic conditions such as hypertension.\nThere are many advantages to switching to a plant-based diet — even if you’re not ready to become fully vegan. These benefits will probably make you think twice before reaching out for that next steak or chicken wing…",
  "content": "## An Introduction to a Plant-based diet\n\nA plant-based diet is a type of dietary pattern that focuses primarily on whole plant-based foods, i.e. minimally processed plants such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, and grains. People on a plant-based diet consume few or no animal products. This means that a person on a plant-based diet eats vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds, and grains, but does not eat any meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or honey.\n\nWhile the term veganism refers to a plant-based diet, the terms vegetarian and plant-based have been used interchangeably and refer to diets that include plant-based foods but allow for some or limited consumption of dairy and eggs. In this article, we will focus on a plant-based diet, which allows for the consumption of all plant-based foods but does not permit the consumption of any animal products.\n\n## Improved Digestive Health\n\nThe first benefit of a plant-based diet is improved digestive health. Consumption of vegetables and legumes leads to better overall gut health, which leads to fewer digestive troubles, including: bloating, cramping, and gas. A plant-based diet is rich in fiber, which is crucial for a healthy gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIt has been shown that individuals who follow a plant-based dietary pattern have reduced constipation and diarrhea; and increased stool frequency and consistency. A plant-based diet can reduce risk of digestive diseases like diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndrome; and improve overall intestinal health.\n\n## Reduced Risk of Certain Cancers\n\nThe second big advantage of a plant-based diet is reduced risk of certain cancers. Research has shown that a plant-based diet is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in the U.S.\n\nA plant-based diet has been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. Given that breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, this is an important health advantage of a plant-based diet.\n\nA plant-based diet is also associated with a reduced risk of lung, stomach, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers. Given that these cancers are the second, third, fourth, and seventh most common causes of cancer death, respectively, this is a significant health benefit of a plant-based diet.\n\n## Reduced Risk of Other Chronic Diseases\n\nThe third advantage of a plant-based diet is reduced risk of other chronic diseases. A plant-based diet can also help with weight management and be protective against type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and hypertension.\n\nA large review of studies found that a plant-based diet was helpful in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure among individuals who suffer from hypertension. Since high blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart diseases, a plant-based diet can be beneficial in reducing the risk. Additionally, a plant-based diet can help with weight management and be protective against type 2 diabetes, which is caused by weight gain and insulin resistance.\n\n## Better Management of Chronic Conditions\n\nThe fourth advantage of a plant-based diet is better management of chronic conditions. A plant-based diet can help individuals manage conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\nFor individuals with gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, a plant-based diet can help ease symptoms and improve overall health. For individuals with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, a plant-based diet may help manage symptoms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA plant-based diet is a dietary pattern that focuses primarily on whole plant-based foods, i.e. minimally processed plants such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, and grains. A plant-based diet is rich in vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, and can also be helpful in reducing the risk of many chronic diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\nAn important advantage of a plant-based diet is that it can help improve digestive health and reduce the risk of a variety of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and type 2 diabetes."
