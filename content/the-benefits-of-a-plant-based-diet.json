  "summary": "A plant-based diet is a type of dietary pattern that focuses primarily on whole plants such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds, and grains. The benefits include improved digestive health, reduced risk of certain cancers, and better management of chronic conditions. Plant-based diets can also help with weight management and be protective against type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and hypertension. An important advantage is that it can help people manage conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.",

This means that a person on a plant-based diet eats vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds, and grains, but does not eat any meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or honey.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While the term veganism refers to a plant-based diet, the terms vegetarian and plant-based have been used interchangeably and refer to diets that include plant-based foods but allow for some or limited consumption of dairy and eggs.
