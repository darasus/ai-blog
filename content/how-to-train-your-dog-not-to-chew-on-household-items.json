Don’t punish your dog for chewing – it’s how they learn and explore their world. Use a word or phrase to let your dog know the item he is chewing on is off-limits. Train your dog outdoors and let him know that he can only chew on his toys on the grass. Teach your dog the “Off” command to “off” items that you absolutely don't want your dog to chew on, but you might even be tempted to.",
