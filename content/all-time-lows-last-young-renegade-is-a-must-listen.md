summary: Themes include regret, growing up, and wondering just where your life
  is heading. The production on ‘Last Young Renegade’ is something else. It has
  a more mature and atmospheric sound than anything else you will find on All
  Time Low’s back catalogue. It is also incredibly cinematic, with lots of
  orchestral backing and sound effects. There are some real stand-out moments in
  this production, particularly the ending of ‘Walls’ (during which you will
  believe someone has hit the rewind button on their CD player)
intro: >-
  There’s something special about third albums. Maybe it’s the pressure to
  impress both new listeners and old fans, or simply the natural progression of
  any band that leaves them feeling eager to experiment. Whatever the reason,
  some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with
  third albums.

  And so it is with All Time Low’s latest offering, ‘Last Young Renegade’. Following on from 2014 album ‘Future Hearts’, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like ‘Crazy Endings’ or ‘Back Home Again’; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like ‘Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>’ or ‘ Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere’. 

  In this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'. From lyrics and themes, to production and official release date, we have got you covered!

## The Lyrics Are Darker Than Ever Before

The lyrics on ‘Last Young Renegade’ are more introspective than ever before. Themes include regret, growing up, and wondering just where your life is heading. This is most obvious in the songs ‘Hollow Bedroom’ and ‘Walls’.
All Time Low frontman Alex Gaskarth has often spoken about how he feels his lyrics are important to fans. It seems that on this album he has put a lot of himself into the songs, leaving them to be much more meaningful than ever before.

## The Production Is Bigger Than Ever

The production on ‘Last Young Renegade’ is something else. It has a more mature and atmospheric sound than anything else you will find on All Time Low’s back catalogue. It is also incredibly cinematic, with lots of orchestral backing and sound effects, making it the perfect soundtrack for a late-night drive.
In terms of genre, it could be described as melodic pop with elements of rock, electronica, and even gospel. There are some real stand-out moments in this production, particularly the ending of ‘Walls’ (during which you will believe someone has hit the rewind button on their CD player).
All in all, this is a record that you need to listen to with a good pair of headphones to fully appreciate its brilliance.

## Track By Track Breakdown

As mentioned above, there is a much darker tone running throughout ‘Last Young Renegade’. With that in mind, here is a breakdown of the tracks and their meanings:

- Hollow Bedroom - The first track on the album, this sees the protagonist, ‘Alex’, moving out of home and into a new life. It explores the feelings of regret, loneliness, and uncertainty that come with this kind of transition.

- Walls - Arguably the most powerful track on the record, ‘Walls’ sees Alex reflecting on his life and the choices he has made. It is an introspective, but hopeful, track that leaves you with a feeling of optimism.

- Last Young Renegade - The title track to the album, ‘Last Young Renegade’ sees the protagonist accept their age, but also looks forward to the future and the path they will walk.

- Dirty Lovers - ‘Dirty Lovers’ sees the protagonist indulge in something that they know is wrong. It is a track that explores the risk and thrill of doing something that you know isn’t right.

- Kids In The Dark - ‘Kids In The Dark’ sees the protagonist come to terms with the fact that, as wrong as their actions are, they are doing it for their future self. It is an exploration of saying sorry to one’s younger self.

- Walls (Wailing Walls) - This is the ‘Walls’ track from the album, but with an added verse from Sound Of The Wailing Wall, a fictional character from the ‘Last Young Renegade’ story. It is a slower, darker take on the original track.

- Close Your Eyes And Say Goodbye - Another track that deals with regret, ‘Close Your Eyes And Say Goodbye’ sees the protagonist ask the question, “Why do we always watch the ones we love leave?” It is a track that deals with the feeling of letting go.

- Exotic - ‘Exotic’ is a track that has a lot of sexual connotations, but also explores the idea of exotic sounding places. It is about taking risks, exploring the world, and travelling.

- International Waters - ‘International Waters’ is a track about growing up, leaving the past behind, and looking towards the future. It is about leaving the shores of your home and setting out on a new journey.

- Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere - This track sees the protagonist exploring a relationship that they know is wrong. It is the fantasy of falling in love with someone who doesn’t feel the same.

- Trapdoor - ‘Trapdoor’ is a track about leaving behind the person you once were, so that you can be someone new. It is about letting go of the past and embracing the future.

- What If I Go? - The final track on the album, ‘What If I Go?’ sees the protagonist come to terms with what they have done and decide to live their life as best they can from then on out.

- Excess Baggage - This track is a bonus song that features on the Deluxe Vinyl version of the album. It is about letting go of the person you used to be to become the person you want to be.
