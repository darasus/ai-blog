## It’s a bold new era for All Time Low

As we mentioned above, each album is a chance for the band to try something new. With this album, we see the band trying out new sounds and exploring different themes.
This is the first record where none of the band members wrote any of the lyrics. Instead, they brought in a wide range of writers to expand their creative process.
This was a risky move but one that clearly paid off as we see each track exploring topics that are new to ATL.
The album explores topics such as mental health and political issues, which are rarely explored in pop punk.

This new boldness is one of the most exciting things about the new album. It makes us even more excited for what ATL will bring us next.

## Mark Hoppus’ involvement

One thing that is clear from the moment you press play on this record is that every member of this band is giving it their all.
Another example of this is Mark Hoppus’ involvement. He was the producer for the album, which is a pretty big deal.
Mark has worked with some of the biggest names in music including Blink 182 and Paramore.
He has had a big impact on pop punk music in the past, and now he’s making his mark on the genre again.

## “Last Young Renegade” is a great introduction track

While there are a lot of great songs on this album, we think “Last Young Renegade” is the best choice as an introduction track.
This song is extremely catchy and also has a deep and thoughtful message at its core.
It talks about the responsibilities that come with being an influential person in culture, and the need to remain true to yourself no matter what.
These are themes that we see explored throughout the entire album and it makes this track a great place to start.

## “Bad Behaviour” is the standout track

While we love the entire album, we think “Bad Behaviour” is the standout track.
This is one of the more political tracks on the album and it examines the current state of our society.
This is a topic that ATL has explored in the past, but they do so in a much more poignant way on this album.
This track is also one of the most musically interesting songs on the album. There is a lot going on, but it never gets confusing or muddy.

## “Dark Side” showcases Alex’s vocals

Alex Gaskarth is one of the best vocalists in pop punk music today.
This album showcases his talents in a new way, especially on “Dark Side.”
We get to see Alex flex his singing muscles on this track in a different way than we’re used to.
This track is a really interesting listen, and it’s one of the most unique on the album.

## Final Thoughts

There are a lot of reasons to be excited about All Time Low and their new album, Last Young Renegade.
This is the first record where ATL fully explore their potential as artists. We get to see them try new things, break out of their comfort zone and push their sound to new boundaries.
This is the type of growth we want to see from artists, and it is extremely exciting.
We are thrilled to see where this new era takes us and can’t wait to hear what ATL has in store for us next.
