These simple carbs are quickly broken down by the body and raise your blood sugar level quickly.\nIf you consume more than 20g of carbohydrate per day, that\\u2019s considered high intake. High intake of carbohydrates can lead to an excess production of glycogen in the liver, which is converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue, particularly around the belly.
