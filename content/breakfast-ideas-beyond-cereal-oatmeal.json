From carbon emissions to water usage and deforestation, it is clear that the modern diet has implications for our planet.\nAn increasing number of people consider their diet when making decisions about their future. Perhaps this is because we are learning more about the environmental implications of our food choices: Eating less meat is good for the planet; eating only local and seasonal food is good for the planet; eating plants instead of animals reduces your carbon footprint; you should avoid palm oil as it\\u2019s destroying the rainforests\\u2026\nTo understand how our diet impacts the environment, we first need to understand what differentiates healthy diets from unhealthy ones. A healthy diet is one that balances calories with nutrition, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals.
