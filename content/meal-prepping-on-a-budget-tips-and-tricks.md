## Commit to the weekend

One of the best ways to lower the cost of your meal prep is to commit to doing it on the weekend, when you have more time to devote to food prep. This way, you’re not spending your time on the weekdays trying to find time to squeeze in meal prep — you’re spending time on the weekend when you can make the most of your time and energy.

If you do it on the weekend, you also have more time to purchase food and store it, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to eat your meals for the week. This way, you don’t have to worry about forgetting to eat your meals for the week, and you can always make sure you have the appropriate meal for each day.

## Shop in advance

One of the most important ways to make sure meal prep stays affordable is to shop in advance. If you can, buy your groceries one or two weeks before your meal prep schedule begins. This gives you enough time to go through your shopping list and make sure you have everything you need to make your planned meals.

Shopping in advance is a great way to lower the cost of your meal prep. First, you can buy items on sale or with coupons that are cheaper than they would be at the normal price. You can also stock up on items that are on sale. You can buy more than you need and freeze or store the rest until your next meal prep session.

## Plan your meals

The first step to successful meal prep is a solid meal plan. You should plan out each of your meals for the week, including snacks and beverages if you’re trying to adhere to a specific diet. This way, you know exactly what you’re eating every day, which makes it easier to meet your nutrition goals and stay within your caloric budget.

Now, your meal plan doesn’t have to be set in stone. You should always be flexible. Be open to eating something new and stay aware of any dietary restrictions that you may have. Don’t be so rigid that you miss out on trying new foods. However, you should have a general idea of what you’ll be eating each day so you have time to prepare.

## Learn to love leftovers

Leftovers can be healthy and delicious when you know how to make them. Experiment with different recipes and see which ones work well with leftovers. See if you can find recipes that make it easy to transform your first meal into a second.

For example, if you’re having tacos for dinner, put extra meat, spices, and toppings away in the fridge. Use those same ingredients to make a new meal the next day, such as a Mexican-style omelet or soup. You can also try making a stir fry or casserole with the ingredients you have left over, or freezing them to use later.

## Be efficient with your cooking time

When you’re cooking your meals, you want to make sure to be efficient with your time. You don’t want to spend hours just prepping and cooking your meals. Make sure to use as many shortcuts as you can, like cooking large amounts of food at once and freezing it, or buying pre-made food items.

Cutting vegetables and meat in advance is a great way to save time in the kitchen. You can also consider investing in kitchen appliances that can make cooking easier, like a pressure cooker or food processor. If you have a lot of time on your hands, you can also try batch cooking, which involves cooking a large amount of food at once and storing it for later use.

## Don’t forget the condiments and snacks

One important part of meal prep is making sure you have snacks and beverages that support your diet. Whether you need healthy, low-calorie snacks for a diet or you have dietary restrictions that require certain snacks, you should make sure you have them and that they’re nearby.

You can also use this opportunity to stock your fridge and pantry with condiments and other food items that you like to use. This way, you can make sure that everything you need is in one place. This can also help you save money by purchasing larger quantities of items, which can lower the cost per item.

## Bottom line

Meal prep is an essential part of staying on track with healthy eating and weight loss goals. It requires a time commitment, but it’s well worth it in the long run!

Any time you make a conscious decision to spend your time and energy making food instead of buying it from a fast food joint, you’re doing something positive for your future. Meal prep allows us to take control over what we eat so that we’re not at the mercy of vending machines, drive-thru windows, or delivery options.
