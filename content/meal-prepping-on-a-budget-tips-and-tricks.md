## What is a content ideation template?

An ideation template is a type of content calendar template that allows you to brainstorm ideas for your blog posts. You can then use these to write blog posts, create videos, or even podcasts. Your content ideation template can be in the form of a spreadsheet, a mind mapping template, or even a notecard template. The ideal ideation template for you will depend on your work style and your preferred way of brainstorming ideas.

Ideation templates are helpful for generating ideas for a variety of purposes, such as blog posts, social media updates, e-books, and webinars. The more ideas you have, the better, so it’s important to have a system for capturing them all. An ideation template can help you do that by providing a visual way to organize your ideas. It’s also useful for organizing your thoughts and keeping track of what you’ve already used.

## Why use an ideation template?

You might think that you don’t need an ideation template, especially if you’re just getting started with creating content. However, even experienced bloggers can benefit from using an ideation template. It’s important to have a system for capturing ideas so that you don’t let them slip away. If you consistently forget to write down your ideas, then you may not have enough content to keep your blog going for the long term.

A content ideation template can help you keep track of your ideas and make sure that nothing is lost in the shuffle. Furthermore, if you work with a team of people, you can use an ideation template to help your team members contribute more ideas.

## How to create a content ideation template

Before you create your content ideation template, you should first come up with your blogging goals. What do you want to accomplish with your blog this year? What do you want your readers to walk away with after reading each of your blog posts? Once you have your goals in mind, you can start creating your content ideation template.

One way to create a content ideation template is to use a mind mapping template. A mind mapping template can help you brainstorm ideas visually and make connections between topics. You can also use a spreadsheet or a notecard template. 
Notecards are great if you prefer to brainstorm ideas on paper. They’re especially useful if you need a physical outlet to get your ideas out of your head. You can then use your notecards to create a visual content ideation template.

## Step 1: Write a list of ideas

Before you jump straight into your content ideation template, you need to come up with ideas for your blog posts. To do this, create a list of topics you want to write about. You can use a notebook or a Google Docs spreadsheet to get your ideas out of your head and onto paper. Alternatively, you could use a mind mapping template to brainstorm ideas visually. No matter which method you use, try to come up with as many ideas as you can. The more ideas you have, the better your content ideation template will be.

Keep in mind that the best blog post topics are those your readers will find useful. If you try to write posts that no one will care about, you won’t see any traffic to your blog. Ideally, you want to write posts that are actionable, solve reader problems, and are easy to understand.

## Step 2: Decide on your topic and key words

Once you have a list of ideas, you can start connecting them to create new blog post topics. Look at your ideas and see which ones you could connect with other topics. For example, if you have an idea to write a post about meal prep lunches, you could also connect that to healthy eating and healthy recipes.
At this point, you also want to decide on your topic and key words. Your topic is the main point you’re trying to get across in your blog post. Your key words are words that readers would use to search for your blog post. They help readers find your blog posts and are also used by search engines to show your blog posts in search results.
To make your blog post more relevant, you can use your key words as often as possible without sounding spammy. Ideally, your key words should appear once or twice per blog post and should be naturally integrated into the text.

## Step 3: Sketch out your ideas visually

Now that you’ve come up with ideas for your blog posts, you can start sketching them out visually. This can help you determine which ideas to use for your content ideation template.

- What images come to mind when you think about your ideas?
- Do these images fit with your blogging goals?
- Are these topics appealing to your readers?
- Do these topics have enough keywords to rank for readers?

If you have a few ideas that you like, you can use them to create your content ideation template. You can start by sketching out a rough outline of your blog posts on sticky notes or index cards. If you’re using index cards, you could even organize them into a content ideation board. Once you have your outline, it’s time to fill out your content ideation template.

## Conclusion

Creating blog content can be time-consuming, but it's also an essential activity for your business. Although you can create a variety of different types of content, articles are an excellent and popular way to engage with readers and draw new visitors to your site. However, they can be difficult to create without a clear idea of your topic. That's why content ideation templates can be helpful. They offer visual organizers that can help you brainstorm ideas for your blog posts.
