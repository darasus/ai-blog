Blockchain is a decentralized network that creates a ledger of all transactions that are verified by members of the network. These networks are most commonly seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they have many other uses as well.\nBlockchain technology has the potential to streamline almost any industry, from finance to retail to even healthcare.

If you\\u2019re a company like Tesla or Google, you might have millions of dollars in equipment on which you\\u2019ve put a considerable investment. When you\\u2019re done with the equipment, you need to know how to sell it.\nBecause you have so many assets, tracking them can be a challenge. You may have hundreds or thousands of computers, along with thousands of other items such as cars, furniture, or appliances. You may also have a variety of software assets, including server and network configurations, databases, and software code.\nWith blockchain technology, you can track all of these assets with ease. You can create a decentralized database where you can track everything from items and software to employees and contractors.

This can be especially useful when you want to upgrade your assets or when you no longer need them.\nYou can resell physical assets like cars, appliances, and furniture, but you can also resell digital assets like software. This is especially common in the tech world, where companies often have millions of dollars\\u2019 worth of software licenses that they no longer need.\nTo resell your assets, you typically need to keep track of what you have, where it is, and who owns it.

This system requires banks to keep money in other banks around the world to make sure they have enough to cover international payments. This is why it can take so long to transfer money.\nAnd why is blockchain a potential solution? Because it\\u2019s a decentralized network, blockchain can confirm transactions almost instantly.
