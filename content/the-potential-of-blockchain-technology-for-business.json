In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary.
