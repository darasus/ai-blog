## Reduce Stress And Anxiety

Stress is one of the biggest contributors to poor health and mental health problems. Meditation has been proven to be as effective as medication when it comes to reducing stress and anxiety. This is especially true for people who have had anxiety disorders in the past, as meditation has been found to be even more effective than medication for these individuals.
When you meditate, you actively practice being present in the moment and letting go of negative thoughts and feelings. This helps to train your brain to be less reactive and more in control of your emotions.
Meditation has also been proven to increase your levels of serotonin and GABA, two chemicals in the brain that are associated with feeling calm and relaxed. When your brain is flooded with these chemicals, they will help to reduce anxiety and stress, as well as increase your ability to fall and stay asleep.

## Improve Focus And Concentration

If you’re looking to improve your focus and concentration, then meditation is the perfect choice for you. Studies show that meditation can boost your ability to focus and concentrate for as long as three months. As you continue to practice this ancient art, your ability to focus will continue to increase.
Meditation has been proven to increase activity in the areas of the brain associated with focus and attention. It can also reduce activity in the areas of the brain linked to distractions and self-criticism. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience found that after just eight hours of meditation, participants experienced a decrease in the activity of the “default mode network” (DMN). This network is linked to daydreaming, being distracted and self-criticism.
And while it might sound cliché, meditation has also been proven to improve your attention span. One study found that after just five days of practicing meditation, participants were able to increase their attention span by an average of 40 percent.

## Help You Sleep Better

Meditation has been proven to help you sleep better by lowering your levels of cortisol. This is the hormone that is released when you experience stress and anxiety. High levels of cortisol can prevent the brain from producing enough melatonin, the hormone that regulates your sleep cycle. As a result, you may experience poor sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep.
Meditation actively works to lower your cortisol levels and as a result, you will experience better sleep quality. You may also find that you are able to fall asleep faster than before and are less likely to wake up during the night.
When you meditate, you actively bring your mind and body into balance. This allows you to experience a deep state of relaxation that will help to lower your cortisol levels and improve your sleep quality.

## Boost Your Immune System

A growing number of studies have found that meditation can actively boost your immune system, making it more effective at fighting off illness. One study found that after just eight weekly meditation sessions, participants experienced a greater than 400 percent increase in levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA is an antibody found in saliva and tears that has been proven to be an effective way to fight off colds and the flu.
Meditation has also been proven to help you cope with stress, which is one of the biggest contributors to lowered immunity. By reducing your levels of cortisol, as well as increasing your levels of oxytocin (a “love hormone”), you will be better equipped to handle stress and its negative effects on your immune system.
Meditation can also help you to get more sleep, which is another important factor when it comes to boosting your immune system. Getting enough sleep at least seven hours each night has been proven to help your body fight off illness. But if you’re only getting five hours of sleep per night, your immune system will be significantly weaker.

## Lower Your Blood Pressure

One study found that people who practiced mindfulness meditation over a period of eight weeks experienced a significant reduction in blood pressure. The study participants also reported being less anxious and having a better quality of life.
Meditation has also been proven to reduce stress, which is another major contributor to high blood pressure. When you meditate, you actively work to let go of negative thoughts and feelings, and focus instead on being present in the moment. This will help to lower your stress levels and make you healthier as a result.
Meditation can also help you to sleep better, which can also reduce your blood pressure. Getting at least seven hours of sleep per night has been proven to lower your blood pressure by as much as 10 percent.

## By helping you breathe better

When we breathe, we infuse our bodies with the oxygen they need to stay healthy and function properly. Deep breathing is a central component of meditation, and it is considered to be the “bridge” between your conscious and unconscious mind.
When you practice breathing deeply, you are actively training your body to breathe better. This can also help you to reduce your stress levels, sleep better and boost your immunity.
When you breathe properly, it’s like pressing the “reset” button on your entire body. You are bringing fresh oxygen directly to your organs and cells, helping them to stay healthy and be at their optimal functioning levels.

## Conclusion

When you make time for meditation on a regular basis, you’ll see both short-term and long-term benefits. You’ll feel less stressed and anxious, have more energy and be better equipped to handle life’s challenges. Meditation is a great way to nurture and care for your mind and body.
You can start by choosing a meditation practice that appeals to you. There are lots of options out there, and you’re sure to find one that works for you. Then, simply set aside a few minutes each day to sit in silence and focus on your breath. Before you know it, you’ll begin to notice how your life has been positively impacted by this ancient practice.
