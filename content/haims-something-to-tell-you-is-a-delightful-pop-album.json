The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure.

After two decades in the music business, Death Cab for Cutie have developed into one of the most beloved bands in indie rock.\nAfter their last album, Codes and Keys (2012), frontman Ben Gibbard announced that he was working on a solo project called The New Age. It was something he had been thinking about for some time but wasn\\u2019t sure when or if it would come to fruition. Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place. The album came out as a collaborative release between Ben Gibbard and Nathan Wiley under the name The Further Adventures of New Age. And three years later Death Cab For Cutie released Thank You For Today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
