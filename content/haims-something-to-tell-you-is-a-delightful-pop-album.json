      "summary": "One of the central themes of \"Birdman\" is the search for authenticity in his work, relationships and his life as a whole. Ego is one of the main things that drives Riggan throughout the film. Fame can bring happiness in the short term, but it isn’t something that lasts, especially in the long term. It can also be detrimental to one’s creativity, as fame can create a fear of failure that stifles the creative process. Being famous is not a prerequisite for living a happy and fulfilling life, as it can lead to envy, isolation and privacy.",
