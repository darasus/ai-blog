  "summary": "The album is full of catchy tunes, strong harmonies and lots of optimism. If you’re looking for a new album to add to your collection, you should definitely give HAIM’s 'Something to Tell You' a listen. The lyrics and harmonies are smooth and soft, with a subtle beat behind it. The song is about being in love and being certain that the person you're with is the person that you want and need in your life. It's about wanting everything and nothing at the same time.",

The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure.

At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate.

They get taught to be one.\\u201D And its trailer goes on to say, \\u201CThe housing bubble was about to burst\\u2026 And a group of misfits saw it coming. Now these unlikely heroes must band together and bring down the greedy villains who crashed the world economy\\u2026 Before anyone else gets hurt.\\u201D\nUnfortunately, that last part is not hyperbole. The actions of unscrupulous financial engineers \\u2014 colloquially known as \\u201Cbankers\\u201D \\u2014 led directly to the Great Recession in 2008, which cost millions their jobs and homes, while triggering widespread deflation and anemic growth throughout much of the developed world for years thereafter.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s about an astronaut called Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars after his crewmates think he\\u2019s dead and leave without him. This might seem as just another case of annoying Hollywood over-simplification: after all, we get so many bioengineered super-geniuses with computer uplink implants that they can become trapped in remote locations via their own stupidity. But there\\u2019s more to it than that.\nIn both book and film, the humanity of Watney comes out in everything he does to survive: logical thinking (how can I eat this potato again?), ingenuity (I need water; how do I distill it from our CO2 filters), courage (explore the abandoned outpost), and compassion (contact my family). He also has a lot of fun with his predicament, cracking jokes through his video log and even going disco.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.
