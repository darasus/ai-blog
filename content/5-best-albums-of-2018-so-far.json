It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us.
