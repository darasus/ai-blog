1. Get some exercise: Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and tension. A good workout can help to release endorphins, which can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed.

2. Take a hot bath or shower: Soaking in a hot bath or shower can help to relax your muscles and ease tension. The heat can also help to improve circulation and promote relaxation.

3. Listen to calming music: Listening to calming music can help to slow your heart rate and breathing, which can promote relaxation.

4. Practice deep breathing: Deep breathing is a simple but effective way to reduce stress. Taking slow, deep breaths can help to lower your heart rate and blood pressure, and calm your mind.

5. Connect with loved ones: Spending time with loved ones can help to reduce stress and promote feelings of happiness and well-being. Whether you stay in touch via text, social media, or in person, quality time with those you care about can make a big difference in your stress levels.
