Mediation is a process in which a mediator facilitates communication between parties to help them resolve a dispute. Mediation is an alternative to litigation, which is often time-consuming and expensive.

There are many different types of mediation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common types of mediation are:

1. Facilitative mediation: This type of mediation is focused on helping the parties communicate and find a resolution. The mediator does not make decisions or offer suggestions.

2. Evaluative mediation: This type of mediation is focused on helping the parties assess their options and make informed decisions. The mediator may offer suggestions and give opinions.

3. Transformative mediation: This type of mediation is focused on helping the parties resolve their dispute and improve their relationship. The mediator helps the parties to understand each other's perspectives and to find common ground.

4. Restorative mediation: This type of mediation is focused on repairing the harm that has been caused by the dispute. The mediator helps the parties to identify the needs of those affected by the dispute and to find ways to meet those needs.

5. Arbitration: This type of mediation is similar to litigation, but it is usually faster and less expensive. In arbitration, the mediator acts as a judge and makes decisions about the dispute. The parties must agree to abide by the arbitrator's decision.

6. Med-arb: This type of mediation is a combination of arbitration and mediation. In med-arb, the mediator first tries to help the parties resolve their dispute through mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, the mediator then acts as an arbitrator and makes a binding decision about the dispute.

7. Mini-trial: This type of mediation is similar to arbitration, but it is usually less formal. In a mini-trial, the mediator hears evidence from both sides and then makes a recommendation to the parties. The parties can accept or reject the mediator's recommendation.
