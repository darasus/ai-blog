  commonly known as ADR, is a way of resolving conflict outside of courts.
  Family mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that is
  used to resolve disputes among family members in a constructive and

intro: >-
  Mediation is a process of resolving conflict. People from different
  backgrounds, beliefs, and values come together, break apart their differences
  and find common ground. Mediation is an effective way to resolve conflicts and
  disputes without going to court or getting into an adversarial situation where
  the parties are at loggerheads with each other forever.

  Instead of arguing back and forth, each side presents their case in a neutral environment. The mediator facilitates conversations by guiding participants through a series of questions and processes that lead to resolution. What we call mediation isn’t one single process but many variations of it. They can be broadly categorized into three types – Collaborative mediation, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) mediation or neutral third-party intervention; Family or couple mediation; And Tribal mediation.

## Collaborative Mediation

When people are locked in a disagreement, they tend to get stuck in an adversarial position. They don’t see their “other” as a partner in finding solutions but as someone who is wrong and needs to be corrected. Collaborative mediation goes beyond dispute resolution to explore ways of creating a partnership between the parties.
When it comes to dispute resolution, there are two basic questions that need to be answered – What is the problem? And what is the solution?

Problem analysis looks at the existing situation and helps participants to identify the issues: who, what, when, where, why, and how.

Solution analysis is about exploring the different options available to the parties to resolve the issues. It tries to see if there is a win-win situation where both parties walk away satisfied. It helps people explore creative ways to resolve the issue: brainstorming, role playing, etc.

When mediation is done collaboratively, it takes on a more creative and flexible process. Instead of asking participants to sit across the table for hours to discuss “who did what”, mediators invite them to “explore ways to create a win-win situation” through creative and flexible processes.

## ADR Mediation

Alternative dispute resolution, commonly known as ADR, is a way of resolving conflict outside of courts. It includes mediation, negotiation, collaborative law, arbitration, and more. ADR mediation is like normal mediation except that it often includes an agreement to go to arbitration if the parties don’t come to a resolution at the end of the mediation.
ADR mediation is an alternative to going to court. It is a process where an impartial third party helps the disputing parties try to find a solution to their problem. This third party doesn’t make a decision for the parties or impose a solution on them. It helps the parties find a solution that works for them.

## Family Mediation

Family mediation is the practice of resolving family disputes outside of the courts. This includes divorces, child custody challenges, inheritances, and more.
Family mediation is a three stage process of exploration, intervention, and resolution. This approach allows families to deal with their challenges in an environment that is more conducive to resolving their issues.
Family mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that is used to resolve disputes among family members in a constructive and non-adversarial way. In many ways, it is similar to other forms of ADR. The major difference is that it is designed to deal with issues that are both intensely personal and highly charged. In other words, it is used to solve disagreements that are both deeply personal and highly emotional.

## Tribal Mediation

Like family mediation, tribal mediation is a process of resolving disputes outside of courts. It is often used to resolve inter-tribal disputes and interpersonal challenges.
Researchers who study tribal mediation say that it is often a way to create harmony between two tribes. The mediators from the two tribes come together and discuss their histories, the issues between their tribes, and possible ways to resolve issues.
This is a way for tribes to come together and heal the past. And it is also a way for individuals to come together and find common ground.

## Neutral Third-party Intervention Or Mediation With Arbitration

This is a less common type of mediation. In a mediation-with-arbitration, both parties agree to mediation and a neutral third-party mediator helps them find a resolution through a process of discussions and explorations.
When the mediation is over, the parties sign a contract: they agree on the solution and also agree to abide by the decision of an arbitrator. The arbitrator is like a judge who has the power to enforce his or her decisions.

## Conclusion

Mediation is an effective way to resolve conflicts and disputes without going to court. It is a process of resolving conflict where people from different backgrounds come together, break apart their differences and find common ground. There are multiple types of mediation, including collaborative mediation, ADR mediation and tribal mediation.
