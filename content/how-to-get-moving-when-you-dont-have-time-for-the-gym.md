## Run On The Treadmill

Many people turn to the treadmill if they don’t have time for the gym. Running is a great cardio exercise as it increases your heart rate and will help you burn fat. With treadmills you can adjust the settings so that it’s tailored to your fitness level. You can increase the incline and speed to increase the intensity of the workout. You can also mix up your running by trying running up and down hills, outside or on a track. Running is a great way to get fit if you don’t have time for the gym.

There are also other benefits to running on the treadmill as opposed to running outside. Running indoors means that you will likely be running later in the day as most people run outside in the mornings. Running at this time of day will be easier on your joints as compared to running outside when it is hotter and you are more likely to get injured.

Running indoors will also help you avoid the common pitfalls of running outside such as bad weather, running into other people and distractions. And as far as safety goes, running indoors is actually much safer than running outside since there is far less chance of being assaulted.

## Mix Up Your Cardio

If you do have time for the gym and are looking for some cardio exercises to get you moving, then you could try altering your cardio routine. Many people go to the gym and do the same cardio routine every week, but there are many different ways to get your heart rate up.

Swimming is a great option, as is rowing. Cycling is another great option, especially if you are a beginner as it is easy on the joints. Incorporating different cardio exercises into your routine will help keep you from getting bored and will also help to vary the intensity of your workouts. You can also mix up the time of day you are exercising. If you are used to going to the gym in the evenings, try going in the mornings instead.

## Incorporate Strength Training

If you are pressed for time or just want to mix things up and have a more balanced workout routine, you could try incorporating some strength training into your week. It is often thought that cardio is the only way to lose weight and get fit, but this is not true. Strength training is also known as weight training and involves using weights or your own body weight to build muscle and strength.

You can easily fit in some strength training by adding it into your cardio routine. Many people overlook the importance of strength training and only focus on cardio. Incorporating strength training into your routine can help to reduce the risk of injury and will also help to make your muscles look more toned and defined.

## Hit The Gym At Non-Traditional Hours

If you’re struggling to find time at the gym, then you could try hitting the gym at non-traditional hours. For example, if you are usually at the gym around 6 p.m. you could try hitting the gym at 8 a.m. This could be a great option for you if you are a shift worker or if you have a lot of commitments during the evening.

If you do decide to do this, you may want to ask a friend to come with you. Going to the gym at non-traditional hours can be a bit scary if you are not used to it. Having a friend come with you will help to make the experience a lot less intimidating. This could also be a great option if you are a student and have a hectic schedule with lots of exams coming up.

## Take A Fitness Class Instead

Another way to get moving when you don’t have time for the gym is to take a fitness class. Many gyms offer a range of different fitness classes, such as Zumba, yoga and even fencing. Taking a fitness class instead of going to the gym will not only help you to get moving but will also help you to socialize.

Taking a class with your friends could be a great way to relieve some stress and have fun while you’re at it. Some gyms will allow you to book classes online and pay per class so that you don’t have to sign up for a long-term membership. This could be a great option if you are a student or someone with a very busy schedule.

## Conclusion

If you are struggling to find time for the gym, then you need to think creatively. There are lots of different ways to get moving even if you don’t have time for the gym. You can mix up your cardio, incorporate strength training into your routine, hit the gym at non-traditional hours or take a fitness class instead.

Making time for exercise is important for your health and well-being. Yet we often find ourselves too busy to squeeze it in. This article will help you get moving even if you don’t have time for the gym.
