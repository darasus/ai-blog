When it comes to system administration and monitoring, the list of available solutions is nearly endless. There are numerous cloud-based offerings that make light work of monitoring resource usage and uptime. For performance monitoring and analysis, there are platform-specific solutions, such as New Relic or App Dynamics for applications written in Python or other popular languages. There are also general solutions like Statsd and Prometheus for collecting performance metrics from any program on your network. The list goes on\\u2014you can find anything from standard logging utilities to software-defined networking (SDN) controllers if you know where to look.\nThere are so many different tools that choosing one to learn as a system administrator can be challenging.
