Applications with no user interface appear to be nothing more than programs running in the background on your computer.\nIt\\u2019s impossible to imagine any application that isn\\u2019t accessible through some sort of graphical user interface. JavaFX provides ways to build and implement interfaces that are engaging, dynamic, and responsive.\nEven though JavaFX is a very powerful library, it doesn\\u2019t provide everything you might need to create a specific type of user interface. You might have noticed this while reading the article about Controls \\u2013 there were a few controls which didn\\u2019t have their own article but were mentioned nonetheless as being part of the javafx-ui-controls module. This means that not all controls are provided by the core JavaFX library (although most of them are).\nIf you plan on using JavaFX for your application, then you should know that several modules exist within the scope of this library: ENDENDENDENDENDENDENDENDEND`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

On the other hand, it\\u2019s so easy to just insert them that most people won\\u2019t take the time to understand how they work. After all, why spend 15 minutes learning something when you can just copy and paste it instead? However, using code snippets effectively is important if you want to save time and effort in the long run.\nThere are many benefits that come with using code snippets effectively. For example, they can help you reduce the amount of time spent on repetitive tasks. You\\u2019ll also learn new information about different programming techniques while reducing your chances of making a common mistake.
