  "summary": "There are many ways to check for errors using the “debugging” feature of your chosen programming language. It’s best to create a variable for every element you want to represent. If you don’t give your variables a new name or “re-scope” them, they will conflict with other variables, causing errors. Conditional statements can be very helpful, but overusing them can cause problems. You can only do so much to avoid errors with minimal disruption to your project.",
