It is an active process of exploring potential areas of interest, testing your knowledge, and expanding your skillset through reading, lectures, tutorials, or even online classes like Lynda or Udemy.\nSelf-learning can be used in almost any area of your life to gain new skills that will help you succeed in your career or personal life.

It involves reading books or online tutorials, practicing skills, watching videos and listening to lectures all by yourself.\nSelf-learning has many advantages over traditional learning methods because it means far more responsibility for your own advancement.
