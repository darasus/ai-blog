Today's learners want to be active and take charge of their own learning experience, rather than being passive recipients of information.

Instead of focusing on memorizing facts and figures, they desire hands-on experiences and interactive solutions. In other words, modern learners want self-directed learning that is current and relevant\\u2014and thankfully there are many ways to achieve these goals.
