However, one must consider the type of blockchain that is being used. For instance, when financial transactions are conducted on a blockchain, speed is not critical. In fact, the transactions could take days or weeks to settle because the parties involved are looking for accuracy and assurance that the settlements are accurate. This is why blockchain is often used for financial transactions.\nThis is also true for other types of transactions that require a certain auditing or verification process. However, speed can be an issue when a blockchain is used for a type of data that is time sensitive.\nFor example, if a blockchain is used for supply chain management that includes monitoring the real-time location of products and raw materials, a minute-long delay in getting that information would be too long. The same is true when a blockchain is used to track medical procedures and important test results. In either case, a few seconds\\u2019 delay in getting that information could be critical and result in serious consequences.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Blockchain requires a lot of time to set up.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Again, this depends on the type of blockchain that you\\u2019re setting up.
