However, one must consider the type of blockchain that is being used. For instance, when financial transactions are conducted on a blockchain, speed is not critical. In fact, the transactions could take days or weeks to settle because the parties involved are looking for accuracy and assurance that the settlements are accurate. This is why blockchain is often used for financial transactions.\nThis is also true for other types of transactions that require a certain auditing or verification process. However, speed can be an issue when a blockchain is used for a type of data that is time sensitive.\nFor example, if a blockchain is used for supply chain management that includes monitoring the real-time location of products and raw materials, a minute-long delay in getting that information would be too long. The same is true when a blockchain is used to track medical procedures and important test results. In either case, a few seconds\\u2019 delay in getting that information could be critical and result in serious consequences.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Blockchain requires a lot of time to set up.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Again, this depends on the type of blockchain that you\\u2019re setting up.

At the same time, it\\u2019s important to pick the type of blockchain that\\u2019s best suited to your business.\nOnce you\\u2019ve done this and know how you want to set up your blockchain, it\\u2019s important to find a blockchain development company that has blockchain experts on staff who can help with the setup and ensure that it\\u2019s done correctly.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The blockchain is a fully secure database.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`First, it\\u2019s important to understand that a blockchain is not a database.

When people say that the blockchain is a fully secure database, what they mean is that the data that\\u2019s stored in the blockchain is secured and is difficult to hack because it\\u2019s decentralized.\nHowever, at the same time, it\\u2019s important to understand that no database is fully secure. What you can say is that a blockchain database is more secure than regular databases.\nThis is because the data in a blockchain database is replicated and spread out over the network.

For one thing, it\\u2019s secure and accurate.

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more.
