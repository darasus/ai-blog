However, one must consider the type of blockchain that is being used. For instance, when financial transactions are conducted on a blockchain, speed is not critical. In fact, the transactions could take days or weeks to settle because the parties involved are looking for accuracy and assurance that the settlements are accurate. This is why blockchain is often used for financial transactions.\nThis is also true for other types of transactions that require a certain auditing or verification process. However, speed can be an issue when a blockchain is used for a type of data that is time sensitive.\nFor example, if a blockchain is used for supply chain management that includes monitoring the real-time location of products and raw materials, a minute-long delay in getting that information would be too long. The same is true when a blockchain is used to track medical procedures and important test results.

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
