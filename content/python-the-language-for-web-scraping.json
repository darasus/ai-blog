In this blog, we\\u2019ll discuss why you should learn Python for web scraping, as well as provide examples, resources and suggestions for getting started. The world wide web has made it easier than ever to share information with one another. However, that same ease of access has also made it harder than ever to separate useful information from noise. Because of this, many developers have turned to web scraping in order to extract the information they need from websites without having to manually search or filter through everything individually. Luckily for you, Python is a perfect language for getting started with web scraping!
