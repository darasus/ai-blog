Applications like artificial intelligence, image recognition, and natural language processing are all fields that can benefit greatly from parallel computing techniques. Because of this demand for parallel computing techniques, there are many programming languages available specifically for this purpose. The Go language is one such example.

You may have heard of terms like CPU, RAM, GPU, and hard drive. All these components play an important role in how quickly and efficiently your computer can handle tasks. Inside these components, there are thousands of tiny transistors that process data.\nThe amount of data that can be processed at any given time is known as the processing capacity of the computer system. A typical computer has a processing capacity of about one or two instructions per second.\nNow imagine you have a large amount of data and need to process it.
