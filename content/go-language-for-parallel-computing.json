  "summary": "The Go programming language was created by engineers at Google in 2007. It was designed with the goal of making it easier to write software that takes advantage of parallel computing. Go is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to use. It’s simple and straightforward, but also has powerful features that make it suitable for large-scale applications. While the Go language does make sense for parallel computing, it does have a few limitations. It doesn’t have built-in features to make it easy to distribute data across multiple machines.",

Parallel computing refers to the simultaneous execution of computer programs or tasks so that they operate at the same time rather than sequentially. This ability to execute multiple processes simultaneously leads to faster and more efficient results. Applications like artificial intelligence, image recognition, and natural language processing are all fields that can benefit greatly from parallel computing techniques. Because of this demand for parallel computing techniques, there are many programming languages available specifically for this purpose. The Go language is one such example. In this article, we will explain what Go is and its benefits for parallel computing.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

A typical computer has a processing capacity of about one or two instructions per second.\nNow imagine you have a large amount of data and need to process it.
