Whether in a home, restaurant, cafeteria or any other eatery, almost all food establishments serve high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat meals that are laden with salt and unhealthy oils.What is unfortunate about this situation is that many people have no choice but to eat this way on a regular basis. If you work in an office, it\\u2019s highly likely that your building has its own kitchen where a catered lunch service prepares hot lunches for staff every day. Similarly, if you go to school, there will most likely be a canteen serving the same type of unhealthy food as an adult educational institution.The good news is that even if you are stuck eating these foods on a daily basis, you can make your kitchen a healthier place by altering what goes into the meals you cook at home and the ones that you buy. Here are some tips on how you can do just that:\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
