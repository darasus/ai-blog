With the introduction of Java 8, there has been renewed interest in Java from the developer community. This is owing to the wide range of features that were introduced in this version of the language. Some of these features are lambda expressions, streams, and enhanced support for concurrent programming. These features make it easier for developers to write code that is concise and low on bugs.

But, with the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, there has been renewed interest in using JavaFX for embedded devices.

You will have to face challenges and difficulties in your work almost every day. In order to overcome these challenges, you need to consistently find ways to improve your coding efficiency and speed.\nWorking efficiently as a software engineer is challenging for most people. Most developers have so many different things on their minds at any given time that it can be hard to keep track of everything simultaneously. As a result, most coders perform slowly because they are thinking too much about what they\\u2019re doing rather than just doing it. However, with practice and dedication, you can learn how to code faster.\nBelow, we will walk you through some tips that will help you become more productive with your coding and accelerate your workflow significantly.

The Java programming language has been around for almost 25 years now, and it\\u2019s still going strong. There are many good reasons for this, but one of the most important is that Java doesn\\u2019t try to be everything to everyone.
