If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java.

The language and its ecosystem provide a robust and scalable platform for software development, as well as implementation on various platforms such as desktop/laptop computers, mobile devices, virtual machines, and cloud environments. With the introduction of Java 8, there has been renewed interest in Java from the developer community. This is owing to the wide range of features that were introduced in this version of the language. Some of these features are lambda expressions, streams, and enhanced support for concurrent programming. These features make it easier for developers to write code that is concise and low on bugs. They can also be easily implemented on various platforms such as embedded devices running Linux. Java has been used to develop embedded systems since its early days.

But, with the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, there has been renewed interest in using JavaFX for embedded devices.
