  "intro": "New technologies and breakthroughs in semiconductor fabrication have enabled the creation of advanced mobile devices. These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems. The latest technology being adopted by both enterprises and developers is the Internet of Things (IoT).",
  "content": "## What is the Internet of Things?\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices that are connected to each other via the internet. These devices may be sensors, actuators, or apparatuses that collect data and send it to a computer system. The computer system processes the data and sends instructions back to the devices. The devices can be remotely controlled by the computer. The term “Internet of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999. He was the founder and executive editor of Wired Magazine's “Interrogator’s” section. Ashton is also the founder of the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nAccording to Gartner, the IoT is expected to be worth $3.9 trillion by the year 2020. This is because as we are moving towards an era of smart cities and smart homes, where our appliances and devices are connected to the internet and controlled by computer systems. This enables us to remotely control these appliances and devices, and also collect data from them.\n\n## Java and the Internet of Things\n\nJava is one of the most powerful and popular programming languages in the world. In recent years, Java has gained popularity in the field of embedded devices, thanks to the introduction of Java 8 and its support for the Internet of Things. Java has been a popular choice for enterprise computing for over two decades. The language and its ecosystem provide a robust and scalable platform for software development, as well as implementation on various platforms such as desktop/laptop computers, mobile devices, virtual machines, and cloud environments. With the introduction of Java 8, there has been renewed interest in Java from the developer community. This is owing to the wide range of features that were introduced in this version of the language. Some of these features are lambda expressions, streams, and enhanced support for concurrent programming. These features make it easier for developers to write code that is concise and low on bugs. They can also be easily implemented on various platforms such as embedded devices running Linux. Java has been used to develop embedded systems since its early days. But, with the advent of Java 8 and its support for IoT devices, Java has gained a new significance.\n\n## JavaFX and the Internet of Things\n\nJavaFX is a platform-agnostic graphical user interface (GUI) framework that is part of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE). It was first introduced in Java SE 9 and has continued to be a part of Java SE 10. The JavaFX framework is primarily used for developing desktop applications, web applications, and mobile applications. But, with the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, there has been renewed interest in using JavaFX for embedded devices. This is because the JavaFX framework is hardware-agnostic, and can easily run on embedded hardware without requiring any changes. It can also be used for communicating with IoT devices via gateways, and for rendering data onto visualizations.\n\nJavaFX, as a rich client-side application framework, enables building Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that are scalable and can be deployed across various platforms. It has a built-in support for web browsers and mobile devices. This makes it a perfect choice for developing IoT applications. JavaFX has a wide range of visual controls that can be used to develop applications. It also has support for multimedia such as audio and video.\n\n## Leveraging JavaFX for the IoT\n\nJavaFX is a great choice for developing IoT applications. This is because it is a cross-platform framework that can easily be used to write applications for IoT devices running Linux. JavaFX applications can run on any hardware, irrespective of its type or operating system. This makes it a perfect choice for embedded devices that are used in IoT applications. With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, developers now have an option to use JavaFX for developing user interfaces (UI) for their applications. This enables them to create rich and engaging applications that are scalable and can be deployed across various hardware. Also, by using JavaFX, developers can leverage the benefits of the rich features and ecosystem offered by the language to develop their applications. This makes the development process easier, faster, and less error-prone.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Internet of Things is a network of interconnected devices that can communicate and exchange data with each other. These devices can be anything from sensors, actuators, or appliances that collect data and send it to a computer system. The computer system processes the data and sends instructions back to the devices.\n\nJava has been a popular choice for enterprise computing for over two decades. It has gained popularity in the field of embedded devices owing to the introduction of Java 8 and its support for the Internet of Things. Java has been used to develop embedded systems since its early days but, with the advent of Java 8 and its support for IoT devices, Java has gained a new significance.\nJavaFX is a cross-platform framework that can easily be used to write applications for IoT devices running Linux. With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, developers now have an option to use JavaFX for developing user interfaces for their applications."
