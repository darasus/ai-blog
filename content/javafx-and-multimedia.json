However, they have some subtle yet important differences that set them apart from one another.\nBut first, before we dive into the details of each programming language, let\\u2019s understand what they both have in common.\nBoth JavaScript and TypeScript are dynamic, object-oriented programming languages designed for creating websites and other interactive applications. They both support curly bracket syntax with optional semicolons, as well > operators for type checking, and if-else conditional statements. Both support variables, data types (string, boolean, number), and function calls with optional arguments and return values.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
