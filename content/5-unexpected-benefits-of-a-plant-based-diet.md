## What is a Plant Based Diet?

A plant based diet or vegan diet is one that consists of a high intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts and grains with few or no animal products. Some people who follow a plant based diet will consume small amounts of dairy products, eggs or honey, and others follow a completely vegan diet which includes no animal products whatsoever. 

A plant based diet can provide all necessary nutrients, but attention should be given to iron, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids as these nutrients may be limited in a plant based diet. 

Adults following a plant based diet can meet their daily protein needs by consuming plant foods that are rich in protein, like beans, lentils, tofu, and soy-based foods.
