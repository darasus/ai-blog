## 5 Unexpected benefits of a Plant Based Diet

## Improved digestion

The high fibre content in a plant-based diet helps to keep your digestive system working properly. Fibre adds bulk to your stool, which helps food to pass through your digestive system more quickly, reducing the time it takes to experience the symptoms of digestive disorders such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

## Better Sleep

The high levels of magnesium found in nuts, seeds and green leafy vegetables such as spinach and broccoli can help you to fall asleep more easily and to sleep more soundly.
You can also try incorporating other natural sleep aids into your diet such as chamomile tea, warm milk, a banana or an oat-based cookie.

## More Energy

The high levels of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats found in a plant-based diet will give you lots of energy.
You can also eat more smaller meals throughout the day to keep your energy levels high.

## Better breath and skin

The high levels of vitamin C in a plant-based diet can help to improve your complexion by preventing wrinkles and fine lines from forming around your eyes, mouth and nose.

In addition, the high levels of iron found in plant-based foods can help to prevent an iron deficiency, which is common in people with poor diets. This can lead to brittle nails and hair, as well as a reduction in your skinâ€™s elasticity.

## Weight loss

A plant-based diet is low in fat so it can be helpful if you are trying to lose weight. The high levels of fibre found in plant-based foods can also make you feel full more quickly, which can be useful if you are trying to lose weight.

The high levels of vitamins and minerals in a plant-based diet are very useful for maintaining a healthy weight. They can help to lower your cholesterol levels and decrease your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

## Conclusion

A plant-based diet is extremely beneficial for your health and can reduce your risk of developing serious diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The high levels of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats found in a plant-based diet will give you lots of energy, help to improve your complexion, and can help you to lose weight. In addition, the high fiber content in plant-based foods can help to keep your digestive system working properly. A plant-based diet has many well-documented benefits including lowering the risk of heart disease and stroke; reducing your risk of developing type 2 diabetes; helping to manage your weight; improving your blood sugar control; reducing your cholesterol levels; preventing certain cancers such as colon cancer; and lowering your risk of dying from any cause.
