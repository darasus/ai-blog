summary: The most important thing you can do to boost your productivity is to
  plan your day the night before. Don’t multitask — focus on one thing at a
  time. Exercise regularly helps your brain stay focused and alert, improve your
  memory and even help you sleep better at night. Use noise-cancelling
  headphones to block out distractions while working in busy rooms. Find a quiet
  room away from the hustle and bustle of life to create a healthy, productive
  environment and collaborate with your colleagues.
intro: >-
  Productivity is a measure of how much you achieve in a given time period.
  If you can consistently and measurably increase your productivity, that means
  you are getting more work done in the same amount of time. It may sound like
  an unimportant concept to focus on, but the benefits of having high
  productivity are clear: You produce more results and have more free time to do
  other things you enjoy. 

  If you’re constantly busy but don’t feel like you’re productive, it might be because your workload is too heavy or because your workflow isn’t optimized for peak performance. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to improve your productivity that are fairly easy to implement. Try these 10 tips to increase your productivity at work, home and everywhere in between!

## Plan your day the night before

The most important thing you can do to boost your productivity is to plan your day the night before. This gives you the ability to wake up with a clear idea of what needs to happen and what your priorities are.
If your job doesn’t require you to plan your day out, it’s absolutely essential that you do it anyway. Your ability to plan and organize is critical to your productivity because it determines how much you’ll get done.
If you’re a manager, plan your team’s day. If you’re an individual contributor, plan your own day. If you’re a parent or a spouse or someone with multiple responsibilities, plan your day and your family’s day. You’ll thank yourself profusely.

## Automate everything you can

Whenever you can, automate everything you can. If you’re using software to do tasks or manage projects, do you really need a human being to be doing them? What if you could get the software to run itself?
These days, it’s easier than ever to automate tasks with the help of software. If you have repetitive activities that don’t require your intellectual capacity, use software to automate them.
You can save even more time by automating common communications. This might include setting up auto-responses for emails, or even creating and sending a canned email to a group of people.
If you have any repetitive work tasks, look for ways to automate them so you have more time for creative and strategic thinking.

## Use a task management app

Task management apps have quickly become the productivity tool of choice. Most of them are cloud-based software that helps you get things done by managing your tasks, your time and your lists — allowing you to see what’s coming up and stay on top of your work.
Most productivity experts recommend using a task management app as part of your daily workflow. This way, you can keep track of your daily goals and stay organized as you complete each task.
These days, you can find a task management app to fit any workflow. Whether you want to be very visual and like to use boards or prefer a more text-based approach, there’s an app for that.

## Don’t multitask — focus on one thing at a time

Multitasking can actually hurt your productivity. Humans have limited attention spans, which means we can only truly focus on one thing at a time.

So, when you’re juggling multiple projects, you’re actually not getting anything done. Instead, you’re switching between tasks and wasting time because you’re not completing any of them.
Try focusing on one task at a time. If you have more than one project going on at the same time, pick the most important one and work on just that until it’s done.
This way, you’re getting more done in the same amount of time, which will reflect in your productivity.

## Exercise regularly

Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your productivity. It can help your brain stay focused and alert, improve your memory and even help you sleep better at night.
If you’re someone who’s easily distracted, exercise regularly to keep yourself on track and focused on your work.
Exercise has also been shown to increase your energy level, which can help you work more efficiently. This can be especially beneficial if you work in an office and need to be able to sit at a desk for long periods of time.

## Don’t work in busy rooms — use noise-cancelling headphones

Lots of offices have open-concept floor plans, where you can see and hear other people working. If you’re in one of those rooms, you’re probably getting distracted by the chatter around you.
Because you can’t concentrate on your work when you can hear everything else, it’s best to find a quieter place to work. Or, if you can’t escape the noise, you can use noise-cancelling headphones to help block out distractions.

If you work from home, you also want to be mindful of the sounds that are around you. Try to find a room with fewer distractions — like a quiet, dark room that’s far away from the hustle and bustle of family life.

## Meet with your team or collaborate with other people

If you work in an office and you’re sharing a space with other people, make an effort to regularly meet and collaborate with your colleagues.
Be present in your workplace and engage with your colleagues. This will help you stay connected to your team and create a healthy, productive work environment.
Collaborating with other people will help you see perspectives you wouldn’t otherwise see, which can help you solve problems quicker and come up with better ideas.

## Take regular breaks and have scheduled downtime

Taking regular breaks throughout your workday is not just a good idea — it’s a law. Most countries have laws in place stating that employers must give their employees breaks throughout the day.
You’ll be more productive and happier if you take a break every few hours. You can visit with your team, take a short walk or catch up on household chores when you’re on your break.
This will help you stay focused and avoid burnout.
Bonus: Having a scheduled break is easier than fighting the urge to take a break when you’re feeling tired.

## Conclusion

Productivity is all about getting more done in the same amount of time. If you can do more in an 8-hour workday, that means you have more free time to do what you enjoy.

There are many ways to improve your productivity, but the most important thing to do is to plan your day the night before. This will help you stay on track and get more done in less time.
