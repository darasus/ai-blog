Assuming you would like tips on how to make time for yourself when you have a busy schedule: 

1. Get up earlier: If you find yourself struggling to find time for yourself during the day, try getting up earlier. This will give you some extra time in the morning to do things that you enjoy or that are important to you. 
2. Set aside some time each day: Dedicate at least 30 minutes each day to doing something that is just for you. This can be something as simple as reading, taking a walk, or taking a yoga class. 
3. Make weekends count: Weekends are often the only time we have to ourselves, so make sure to use this time wisely. Dedicate at least one day of the weekend to doing something that you enjoy or that is important to you. 
4. Don’t be afraid to say no: We often find ourselves stretched too thin because we say yes to too many things. Learn to say no to things that you don’t really want to do or that don’t fit into your schedule. 
5. Delegate and ask for help: If you find yourself with too much on your plate, delegate some of your responsibilities to others. And don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. 
6. Simplify your life: One of the best ways to make time for yourself is to simplify your life. This means getting rid of anything that is unnecessary or that is taking up too much of your time. 
7. Make time for your hobbies: Hobbies are a great way to relax and de-stress. Make sure to schedule some time each week to do something that you enjoy. 
8. Get organized: A big part of making time for yourself is being organized. This means having a plan and knowing what you need to do and when you need to do it. 
9. Take a break: When you are feeling overwhelmed, take a break. This can be a few minutes or a few hours, depending on what you need. Step away from your work and take some time for yourself. 
10. Prioritize your health: Your health should always be a priority. Make sure to schedule some time each day or week for exercise, healthy eating, and relaxation.
