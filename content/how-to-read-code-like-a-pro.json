However, reading and understanding code isn\\u2019t always easy, especially when it\\u2019s written in a foreign language or has certain nuances that are beyond your current understanding.\nReading code like an expert means more than just knowing what words mean and their general significance.

When a programmer writes a piece of code, they\\u2019re writing it for themselves first and foremost. They\\u2019re using their own shorthand and abbreviations to keep things tidy and easy to understand for themselves. This is especially true in languages like JavaScript that are more forgiving than other programming languages. Code that looks like absolute gibberish up front is often a sign that the programmer has been keeping things tidy for themselves.

While you\\u2019re reading the declaration, be sure to keep an eye out for words that you don\\u2019t understand.

Instead, try to read that line of code as though you were reading a sentence in English. Break it down into its components and try to understand what each part means.
