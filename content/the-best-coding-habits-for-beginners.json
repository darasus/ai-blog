In fact, it\\u2019s one of the most difficult tech fields to get started in as a beginner. But it\\u2019s also one of the most lucrative careers you can choose to pursue. The average software engineer salary is around $100K per year, which is even more impressive when you consider that the average age of software engineers is only 29! If you want to start a new career in coding but feel like you\\u2019re starting at square one, we have some advice for you. As someone who has been coding for over 10 years now, I can tell you with complete certainty that great coders are made and not born. Anyone can learn how to code if they are willing to work hard at it and adopt some good habits along the way.

This includes things like basic computer science concepts, programming languages, and syntax. There is a lot to learn when it comes to coding, but you need to make sure you have a strong foundation in the basics before attempting to write your first full-fledged program. The good news is that this is something you can learn over time as you develop more experience. This advice may sound obvious, but we see it happen all the time. You don\\u2019t want to be someone who has to take 6 months to learn the basics before you can write your first program. It\\u2019s a much better idea to start with the basics and then move onto the more challenging aspects of coding once you have the basics down.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Exercise regularly\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This one might sound strange, but it\\u2019s a habit that many great coders follow religiously. The fact is that regular exercise has been scientifically proven to improve brain health. In fact, studies have shown that exercise can improve blood flow to the brain and strengthen neural connections by as much as 10%! This means that you will be able to learn new concepts, including coding, faster and more efficiently when you exercise regularly. You can do yoga, go for a walk, swim, or do anything else that gets your body moving. Just make sure you find a way to exercise regularly so that you can get the most out of your coding studies.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Find a study group\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Learning to code is something that should be done in a social environment. You will make mistakes, and you will need people around you to help you figure those mistakes out. What\\u2019s even better is that when you are involved with a study group, you will find that you are also helping other people solve their issues and become better coders in the process. This is why finding a study group that meets regularly is one of the best ways to ensure you are making the most out of your coding studies. You can go online to find groups that meet through video conferencing services like Zoom. Alternatively, you can find a coding meetup near you and meet other coders in person.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t be afraid of Google and YouTube\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It\\u2019s easy to get discouraged when you\\u2019re just starting out and feel like you\\u2019re not getting anywhere. This is especially true when you\\u2019re just starting out with coding and don\\u2019t know where to begin. In situations like this, it\\u2019s easy to feel like you\\u2019re the only one who feels this way. But in reality, every new coder out there has gone through similar feelings of discouragement and anxiety. This is why you should make use of tools like Google and YouTube when you feel stuck. Google has a wealth of information on every programming language out there, so it\\u2019s a great place to start when you feel like you\\u2019re lost. YouTube is also a fantastic source of beginners\\u2019 tutorials for all sorts of programming languages. You can use these resources to help you find clarity and get unstuck when you need it most.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Take care of your mental health\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Coding is not for the faint of heart. It\\u2019s a challenging career that requires a great deal of mental focus and effort. This means that you will have your ups and downs along the way, and it\\u2019s important to know how to handle these changes in your mental state. When you\\u2019re first starting out, it\\u2019s easy to get caught up in the idea that you have to learn everything there is to know as quickly as possible. This can be extremely overwhelming, and it can lead to mental health issues like stress and anxiety. You can avoid these issues by taking time to relax and enjoy your life outside of coding. Make sure that you are setting aside time to do things you enjoy, like going to the gym, hanging out with friends, playing sports, etc.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Learning to code is not easy and it is not something that you can do quickly. It is a skill that takes time to master and takes perseverance to get started. When you are just getting started, it is important to make sure that you start with the basics and avoid diving into coding before you have a good grasp of these topics. It is also important to make sure that you are exercising regularly, finding a study group, and taking care of your mental health when you are first starting out. These habits will help you stay focused and be successful as a beginner coder.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
