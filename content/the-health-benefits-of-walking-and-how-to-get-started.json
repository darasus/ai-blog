It\\u2019s hard to get kids excited about eating their vegetables, but luckily there are plenty of tricks that make it easier.\nAddressing their senses is a good place to start. The sense of smell and taste are the primary drivers of our desire to eat one thing or another. Kids love things that look, smell, feel and taste good. The trick is finding ways to incorporate these elements into nutritious meals so they want to eat them.\nOne way parents have been able to do this is by using smoothies as an opportunity to add hidden veggies into their kid\\u2019s diets without them knowing it. And, since you\\u2019ll be using green smoothies as the base for your drink\\u2014not just any old sweet smoothie\\u2014it won\\u2019t add any sugar or calories that you don\\u2019t want in there.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

For some it might be a small splurge, for others, a luxury they can\\u2019t afford. Either way, eating healthy on a budget isn\\u2019t easy. Eating less processed and pre-packaged foods is one way to cut costs and stay healthy at the same time. Another way is to get creative and buy things when they are on special or use cheaper alternatives like frozen or canned versions of fruits and veggies instead of the fresh ones. There are many ways to do this that won\\u2019t leave you feeling deprived while still giving your body what it needs to be healthy.\nFor those who eat a lot of fast food or find themselves eating unhealthy because it\\u2019s cheaper than buying wholesome foods, these tips will help you make healthier choices while saving money at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
