However, a balanced diet with plenty of plant proteins is essential for any health-conscious individual.\nA balanced diet is crucial if you want to stay fit and healthy. That\\u2019s because your body needs a variety of nutrients - such as vitamins, minerals, and fats - from different sources in order to function optimally. When one type of food is over- or under-consumed, the consequences can be negative.\nOn the other hand, plant proteins are an important source of essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the human body. These compounds are found abundantly in plant foods such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans, peas, and other nuts and seeds.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, the word \\u2018processed\\u2019 can be misleading.\nProcessed foods almost always have a shorter shelf life than their unprocessed counterparts. This is because they have been altered in some way to make them last longer and to make them more convenient to consume. Processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy and unprocessed foods aren\\u2019t always healthy.\nProcessing can take many forms. Some examples of processed foods include canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, oils that have been refined or hydrogenated (as in Crisco), salt, sugar and starch that has been extracted from its original source (as in corn syrup or white sugar), spices that have been ground up, protein that has had artificial flavors or preservatives added to it (as in MSG), or food that has had artificial colors added to it (such as Red 40).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
