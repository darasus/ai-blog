## What Are The Benefits Of Screen Time?

Screen time can provide a variety of benefits to your child including increased cognitive and language skills, increased problem-solving skills, improved social skills and improved hand-eye coordination. Additionally, screen time can be a great way for your child to learn new things, such as when they watch educational programming. It can also be a great way for them to connect with family and friends who live far away. It can also help to relieve boredom, which can be a major issue for kids with too much downtime.

Screen time can also be a helpful tool when it comes to transitioning to a new environment or situation, such as when you’re traveling. It can help to distract your child from the unfamiliar surroundings and provide some comfort and familiarity in a new situation.

## What Are The Risks Of Screen Time?

While screen time can provide benefits for your child, there are also some risks associated with it. These include the risk of decreased social skills, sleep disruption or sleep disorders, a decrease in physical activity and the potential for your child to develop a negative body image.

In addition, there is some research that suggests excessive screen time may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia in children. Screen time may also negatively impact your child’s academic performance and brain development.

## Know Where Your Child Is While Screen-ing

While there’s no hard and fast rule about how much screen time your child should receive, it’s important that you know what they’re doing when they engage with digital media. Knowing what sites they visit and what they search for online can help you to understand more about your child’s digital habits and make informed decisions about how much screen time they receive. This will allow you to screen content more effectively and keep your child safe online.

It’s also important that you know what applications your child is using. This includes apps on their phone, on your home computer or on any other devices that they have access to. You can monitor what apps your child is using by setting up account restrictions on their devices or by installing monitoring software on your computer.

## Set Timers For Screen-ing

Setting timers for your child’s screen time can help to create an awareness about the amount of time they spend looking at a screen. This can be helpful for monitoring the amount of time kids spend on their devices, watching television or playing video games. You can set specific timers for different devices, which allows you to keep track of their screen time more effectively.

There are a number of apps and websites that allow you to track how much time your child spends on their devices. There are also some devices, such as the Family Timer, that allow you to track screen time manually. These kinds of devices can be helpful if you want to keep track of screen time for more than one child.

## No Screens At Dinnertime Or During Bedtime

It’s important to create some boundaries around screen time and set expectations for when your child can and cannot use devices. If you have a child who spends a lot of time on their devices, it’s important that you have set hours when they can’t use them. You can use this time for other activities, such as reading or playing outside. You can also use this time for family bonding activities, such as playing board games or doing puzzles.

It’s also important that you set boundaries around bedtime. While there’s nothing wrong with your child using screens before bed, it’s important that you have consistent rules about when they can use them.

## Take Shorter Breaks In Between Screen Sessions

In between screen time sessions, it’s a good idea to take short breaks. Ideally, you want to take a break that lasts at least 20 minutes. This will give your child a chance to rest and recharge before getting back to their devices again.

Taking breaks between screen time sessions is also a good way to help prevent screen addiction. This can be especially important for young children who are still developing their brains. It’s important to avoid screen time before bedtime as well. It can keep your child from getting the sleep they need to function the next day.

Taking regular breaks from your devices can have major benefits for your overall health and well-being. It can help to reduce stress, increase feelings of happiness and improve your mood. It can also help to improve your attention span, productivity and ability to focus.
