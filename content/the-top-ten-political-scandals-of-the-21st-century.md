## The U.S. Senate’s “Memogate” Scandal

The U.S. Senate’s “Memogate” scandal began in 2003, when staffers in Republican Senator Rick Santorum’s office were caught forging documents in order to accuse Democratic U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton of helping to promote China’s interests.
This scandal is unique because it incorporates all the aspects of a classic political scandal: privacy issues, personal misconduct, and national security.
Santorum’s staffers hacked into a computer server that housed Clinton’s private email server. Once they were in, they copied emails and manipulated documents.
The scandal eventually led to the firings of four Santorum aides, which was then followed by the senator’s resignation.

## Iraq War’s Discrepancy in the Bush Administration

The Iraq War’s discrepancy in the Bush Administration was an investigation into White House officials who had misused intelligence to support the war in Iraq.
This scandal led to the conviction of I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, and the resignation of CIA Director George Tenet and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
When the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released its final report on the war, it concluded that the Bush Administration had “misrepresented the threat posed by Iraq, misled the American people, and squandered the world’s trust.”
The report also concluded that the Administration had “exaggerated the Iraqi threat” with “imprecise” and “inadequate” intelligence and that it had “overstated the Iraqi threat” by using “raw intelligence” that was “interpreted in the most threatening manner possible.”

## Hillary Clinton’s Use of a Private Email Server

Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was an investigation into the former Secretary of State’s use of a private email server to conduct U.S. diplomatic correspondence.
This scandal led to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into Clinton’s email server, as well as to two high-profile congressional investigations during Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
When FBI Director James Comey concluded the investigation, he recommended that no charges be filed against Clinton.
But his report did conclude that Clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of classified information.
Clinton had used a private email server to conduct State Department correspondence.
The scandal was significant due to the inherent concerns over national security and data privacy.

## Edward Snowden Reveals NSA Surveillance Tactics

Edward Snowden reveals NSA surveillance tactics was an investigation into former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s leaking of classified information on government surveillance operations.
This scandal led to the Snowden leak, in which Snowden had revealed the existence of numerous global surveillance programs run by the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA).
When the leak was published in The Washington Post and The Guardian in June 2013, it prompted international debates and actions over civil rights and the appropriate scope of governmental surveillance.
The scandal was significant due to the inherent concerns over privacy and the Internet.

## Eric Holder Resigns as Attorney General

Eric Holder resigns as Attorney General was a scandal in which the first African American Attorney General of the United States resigned after being criticized for his handling of various high-profile cases.
This scandal had its roots in the American Civil Liberties Union’s criticism of Holder’s “broken promise” to investigate and prosecute civil rights abuses against Muslims in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
This scandal had led to congressional criticism of Holder’s department’s prosecution of the press in two high-profile cases: the investigation into the identification of CIA analyst Mark W. Allen on national security grounds against the New York Times and the seizure of phone records from Associated Press in relation to a story about a foiled terrorist attack in Yemen.

## Harvard’s Admissions Scandal

Harvard’s Admissions Scandal was an investigation into Harvard’s discriminatory practices against Asian-American students in the college admissions process.
This scandal had led to a lawsuit filed against Harvard by a group of Asian-American students accusing the institution of racial discrimination in their admissions process.
This scandal had led to an investigation by the Department of Justice, which discovered that Harvard had been discriminating against Asian-American applicants.
This scandal was significant due to the inherent concerns over discrimination and equality in higher education.

## FIFA Corruption Investigation Leads to 14 Arrests and Multiple Resignations

The FIFA corruption investigation leads to 14 arrests and multiple resignations was an investigation into the corruption of FIFA and its Executive Committee members.
This scandal led to the FIFA corruption investigation and the arrest of several FIFA officials.
This scandal led to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter and FIFA Executive Committee members.
This scandal was significant due to the inherent concerns over the integrity of sporting events and the organization hosting them.

## Conclusion

The political scandals in the 21st century are more serious than those in the 20th century. These modern-day political scandals are more tied to ethics and values, and they are no longer just about sex, money, or alcohol. They revolve around key issues such as corruption, racism, gender inequality, and sexual assault.
The political scandals of the 21st century are also different from those of the 20th century because they are no longer just about one politician. They are often tied to entire administrations and, in the case of the FIFA scandal, even organizations.
