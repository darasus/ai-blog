## Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

The first game on our list is the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. This collection includes remastered versions of the first three Crash Bandicoot games that originally came out on the PS1.
If you played these games when they first came out, you’ll probably remember that they’re extremely challenging. The Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, on the other hand, is much more forgiving.
There’s still plenty of challenge in the remastered versions of these games, but they’re not nearly as frustrating as the originals. Plus, they’re a lot of fun and a great nostalgia trip for anyone who grew up with the original versions.
This collection is great for anyone who wants a challenging but fun game to play. It’s one of the best games for people who want to have fun without feeling stressed out by the difficulty of the game.

## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

Next up is the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This is the remastered version of the original Mario Kart 8 game that came out for the Wii U.
This game features all the original tracks from the Wii U version, plus a new battle mode and some new characters, including Captain Toad and King Boo.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a racing game where you drive various vehicles to win against other players. If you’re more of a casual gamer who doesn’t want to deal with intense pressure and an unclear finish line, this game might be a good fit for you.
There are various difficulty levels you can select in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe depending on your skill level and how intense you want the game to be. Whether you’re a casual or hardcore gamer, this game is sure to provide hours of fun.

## Mario Tennis Aces

Next up on our list is the Mario Tennis Aces. The most recent installment in the Mario Tennis franchise, this game is sure to please all fans of the sport. You can play alone or with friends as one of 16 playable characters from the Mario universe, including Mario, Luigi, and Bowser.
The game features both a single-player and a multiplayer mode. In the single-player mode, you can play a tournament or challenge mode and try to win as many games as possible to increase your ranking. In multiplayer mode, you can challenge other players in your area, play a doubles match, or try to beat the computer.
Mario Tennis Aces is a great game for people who like sports games, but it’s also fun for people who don’t usually play sports games.

## Kirby Star Allies

Next up on our list is Kirby Star Allies. This is the latest Kirby game, and it’s now available on the Nintendo Switch.
Kirby is a cute little pink blob who has starred in various puzzle games, platformers, and other types of games over the years. Kirby Star Allies is a platformer, but it’s less challenging than many other games in the Kirby franchise.
Kirby Star Allies is a co-op game where you can play with up to three other people. You can play alone with computer-controlled characters, but you aren’t able to customize their abilities as you can when playing with other people.
You can play this game with anyone, whether they’re a child or an adult who is new to video games. It’s a great game for anyone who wants a fun and less challenging experience.

## Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

Next up on our list is the Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. This is the remastered version of the original Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze game that came out on the Wii U.
This is a side-scrolling platformer, which means the game is displayed from a side view and you can only move from left to right as you play. It’s similar to an old-school Super Mario Bros. game, but it has a different plot and other unique features.
This game is challenging but not as difficult as the original version. If you’re not a fan of struggling to beat a game, Tropical Freeze is a great choice because you can still enjoy the storyline while not feeling too frustrated by the difficult puzzles.

## Sumo Digital’s Jumping Game

Last on our list is Sumo Digital’s jumping game. This is a new game from the same people who created the Sonic the Hedgehog games.
This is a simple platformer where you use your character’s jump to move through the game without falling off the edges. The twist is that you can control the direction your character jumps in. You can do tricks in the air and try to collect as many points as possible. It’s a very simple game that’s great for people of all ages.
This game is perfect for people who want to have fun while also practicing a bit of hand-eye coordination.
It’s also a great game for groups of people who want to challenge each other but don’t want to be overly competitive.
