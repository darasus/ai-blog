summary: Researchers, academics and philosophers have been arguing about what
  “Artificial Intelligence” really means for decades. One school of thought is
  that AI is the pursuit of creating machines capable of human-like reasoning,
  problem solving, creative thinking and self-improvement. The reality of what
  AI programs can do falls somewhere between the two extremes mentioned above.
  Some AI programs excel at solving specific problems or performing a particular
  task. Others can excel at executing a very narrow set of tasks, but very few
  can do anything approaching human-level intelligence.
intro: >-
  You know that old adage about not putting all your eggs in one basket?
  Well, it turns out even super successful, genius-level tech entrepreneurs can
  fall victim to the perils of not thinking things through. Ask Elon Musk. 

  That’s right—the same guy who previously gave us PayPal (which was later succeeded by and then purchased by ), Tesla Motors, SolarCity and SpaceX has now been left holding the bag on another one of his ventures: Artificial Intelligence firm “Neuralink”. 

  The good news is that this time around, it looks like Mr. Musk has learned from his past mistakes and will be getting back on track soon enough. But until then, let’s take a moment to review all the recent drama with Artificial Intelligence, as well as what we can expect from AI in the future…

## What’s going on with Artificial Intelligence?

Much like the definition of a cashmere sweater, the exact definition of “Artificial Intelligence” is a little fuzzy. Researchers, academics and philosophers have been arguing about what this term really means for decades now, and the debate shows no sign of settling down any time soon.
One school of thought is that AI is the pursuit of creating machines capable of human-like reasoning, problem solving, creative thinking and self-improvement. This is often referred to as “Strong AI”—or sometimes just plain “AI”.
Another school of thought is that AI is a computer program designed to simulate or imitate human intelligence. This is often referred to as “Narrow AI”.

The upshot of all this is that there really is no one consensus-agreed upon definition of what AI is. As a result, it can be very hard to know what people are actually talking about when they start tossing around phrases like “artificial intelligence”, “strong AI”, “weak AI”, etc. 
In other words, if someone tells you “AI is the future”, they might not be talking about the same thing you’d be imagining. So, it’s important to carefully examine what someone means when they use the term “AI”.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

If we have a hard time agreeing on what AI is, we’ve also had trouble reaching consensus on what AI can do.
Not surprisingly, the reality of what AI can do falls somewhere between the two extremes mentioned above.
Some AI programs can excel at solving specific problems or performing a particular task. Others can excel at executing a very narrow set of tasks. But very few can do anything approaching human-level intelligence.
For example, an AI bot might be able to easily beat you at chess. But it doesn’t have any common sense about the real world, like that you shouldn’t walk off a pier if you can’t swim.
On the other hand, many humans lack the capacity to excel at playing chess, so there is a certain advantage to being AI here.

## Where is all this AI nonsense coming from?

We don’t really know. A lot of it is just uninformed speculation and hype. Some of it is fear-mongering.
Some of it is more thoughtful and well-informed—albeit still misguided.
The current AI “boom” may be partially caused by some recent improvements in the capabilities of computer programs designed to simulate or imitate human intelligence. It may also be related to an increase in investment in AI research and development.
For example, some of the recent breakthroughs in AI have been made possible by better hardware, such as silicon chip-based (as opposed to “neural network”-based) computers that can process data much faster than before.

## Who’s in charge of the current hullabaloo?

There isn’t just one “person” in charge of the current hullabaloo. It’s a widespread phenomenon that spans many different industries, countries and ideologies.
That said, the current hullabaloo does seem to be generally centered around Silicon Valley, the Chinese government and transhumanist philosophers.
Silicon Valley is responsible for a lot of the hype. They’re responsible for creating a narrative that AI is a “breakthrough”, rather than just one more incremental improvement in technology. The narrative has been heavily pushed by investment in AI companies.
In addition to the hype, there is also some genuine anxiety about the future of the AI industry. China is currently the world leader in AI research and development and also has a significant interest in the industry.
These factors have led to some concerns that AI will create a “biased” or “Chinese” Artificial Intelligence.

## Where does AI go from here?

We can expect AI to continue to grow in its utility and effectiveness. We can also expect AI to continue to be used to replace human workers.
We can also expect to see increasing fears and concerns about AI, and attempts to regulate or “control” AI.
We can expect to see AI being used to produce a greater variety of goods and services. And we can expect to see AI used to topple authoritarian regimes.
We can expect to see AI used to create more sophisticated and effective cyber defense systems.
We can expect to see AI used to “hack” and manipulate elections. We can also expect to see AI used to defend against such attacks.
We can expect AI to be used for more effective propaganda and political misinformation campaigns.
We can expect AI to be used for more effective data collection and surveillance.
We can expect AI to be used for more effective marketing and product design.

## Final Words

The whole Artificial Intelligence debate is actually quite fascinating and a great example of how technology and society interact. As with many contentious issues, one doesn't need to be an expert to have an opinion on AI, and as a result, many people have strong feelings about the subject, often based on little more than what they've read in the news or what they've seen portrayed in movies.
