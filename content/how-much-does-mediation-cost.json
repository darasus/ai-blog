Are you trying to make a good meal last for several days and not just one? Are you struggling to find affordable, healthy options near your home or work? If so, you\\u2019re not alone. Eating healthy can be expensive and challenging. The cost of healthy food has gone up while the cost of unhealthy food has gone down. But this doesn\\u2019t mean that eating healthy is impossible; it just means we all need to get a little bit more creative.\nEating well on a budget can be challenging, but it isn\\u2019t impossible. Making smart choices about what you buy as well as how you cook your food can make a big difference in how much money you spend on food each month and how healthy your diet is at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is an opportunity for people who are in a dispute to speak directly with one another, explore their differences and find common ground. Mediation is not about winning or losing; it\\u2019s about finding peace so everyone can go forward with their lives.\nMediation has been used as an alternative to litigation for more than 2,500 years. The practice of mediation has continued to evolve over time and today there are many different types, including: family mediation, dispute resolution, community mediation, transformative mediation and collaborative law. However, they all have the same core elements and are intended to achieve the same goals: finding common ground between two parties in conflict; preserving personal relationships; and resolving problems constructively by using active listening techniques.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

People from different backgrounds, beliefs, and values come together, break apart their differences and find common ground. Mediation is an effective way to resolve conflicts and disputes without going to court or getting into an adversarial situation where the parties are at loggerheads with each other forever.\nInstead of arguing back and forth, each side presents their case in a neutral environment. The mediator facilitates conversations by guiding participants through a series of questions and processes that lead to resolution. What we call mediation isn\\u2019t one single process but many variations of it. They can be broadly categorized into three types \\u2013 Collaborative mediation, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) mediation or neutral third-party intervention; Family or couple mediation; And Tribal mediation.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
