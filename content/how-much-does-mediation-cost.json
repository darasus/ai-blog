You pay for it either directly by paying the mediator or indirectly by paying the lawyers. But how much does mediation cost?\nMediation costs will vary depending on where you live, the nature of your dispute, and the reputation of the mediator or firm you choose to take on your case.\nWhile some attorneys may offer their clients a choice between litigation and a certain number of hours of mediation at a reduced rate as an alternative to litigation, most attorneys charge their standard rates for mediation services.\nThe hourly rate for a private mediator may range from $100 per hour to $300 per hour or more; however, most mediators will have standard market rates that fall within that range. Many corporations and nonprofit organizations negotiate group discounts when contracting with third-party mediation services. In general, expect to spend $200 to $500 per party for a one-day mediation session with two neutral mediators and an independent arbiter.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

A single dispute involving two parties might be completed in a day. A complex dispute involving multiple parties and/or issues could take many weeks or months to complete.\nMediation methods can vary greatly, but most mediation sessions follow a similar process: First, the parties and their representatives meet with the mediator (or mediators) to discuss the issues in dispute and to agree on the facts and issues in the case. If the parties and their representatives can resolve the issues, they do so at this stage. If they are unable to reach an agreement, the mediator will try to help them narrow the areas of disagreement so they can focus on the facts that remain in dispute. Where necessary, the mediator will then bring in independent fact-finders to help the parties determine the facts in dispute. Following the fact-finding process, the parties return to the mediation session with the mediators to try to reach an agreement. If the parties can reach an agreement, they sign a settlement agreement at the mediation session. If the mediation session ends without an agreement, the mediators will issue a written mediation report. This report will not include any recommendations or conclusions.

A mediation session will probably cost less than a single day in court.\nThe total cost of litigation, however, will depend on many factors, such as the number of issues in dispute, the number of depositions and/or interrogatories to be taken, the amount of discovery to be conducted, the number and type of expert witnesses to be retained, the number of hearings and/or trials to be conducted, the number of hours your attorneys will spend on your case, and so on.\nThe costs of mediation, on the other hand, will depend primarily on the hourly rate your mediator charges, the length of time it takes to complete the mediation, and the number of parties involved.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Other Factors That Affect Mediation Costs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The location of the mediator: Mediators who work in major cities will charge higher rates than mediators who work in smaller cities or towns.
