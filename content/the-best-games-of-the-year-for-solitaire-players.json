Or maybe you\\u2019ve played with people who were so scared of losing that they refused to take any risks? Perhaps you\\u2019ve been on the other side, acting like a jerk just to get your friend mad and force them to win.\nScrubs, control-freaks, cautious nerds\\u2014 there are as many types of board gamers as there are games.
