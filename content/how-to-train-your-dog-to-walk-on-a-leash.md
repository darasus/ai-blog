Assuming you would like an article discussing tips for leash training a dog: 

It is important to start leash training your dog as soon as possible. The earlier you start, the easier it will be for your dog to learn. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Choose the right leash. There are many different types of leashes available, so it is important to choose one that is comfortable for both you and your dog. A retractable leash may be a good option if you are looking for something that is adjustable.

2. Start with short walks. When you first start leash training, it is important to keep the walks short. This will help your dog get used to the feeling of being on a leash and prevent him from getting too overwhelmed.

3. Be consistent. It is important to be consistent when leash training your dog. This means walking him at the same time each day and using the same route. This will help your dog learn more quickly.

4. Reward good behavior. Be sure to praise your dog when he is walking nicely on the leash. This will help him understand that he is doing something that you approve of and will encourage him to continue this good behavior.

5. Avoid punishment. It is important to avoid punishing your dog when he is on a leash. This can include things like pulling on the leash or scolding him. Punishing your dog will only make him more resistant to leash training and could make the process take longer.
