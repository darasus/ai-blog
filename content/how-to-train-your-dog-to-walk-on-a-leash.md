summary: A leash is long enough to give you enough room to walk comfortably but
  short enough so that it doesn’t drag on the ground when you’re not holding it.
  A crate can be a great place for your dog to rest, especially when you're
  training them to walk on a leash. The best way to train your dog is to use a
  “heel” command to keep them closer to you and prevent them from becoming a
  nuisance around other people and dogs.

## What You’ll Need

Before you begin training your dog, you’ll need to stock up on a few essentials. You may already have a few of the below listed items, but it’s a good idea to check that everything is in good condition and ready to be used.

- Leash - Get a leash that is long enough to give you enough room to walk comfortably but short enough so that it doesn’t drag on the ground when you’re not holding it.
- Crate - A crate can be a great place for your dog to rest, especially when you’re training them to walk on a leash.
- Treats - While any snacks will do, certain treats are actually designed to help with dog training.
- Clicker - This device is designed to mark a desired behaviour, like your dog sitting or staying put.

## Start Outside

Before you ever bring your dog indoors to walk with you on a leash, you should start your training outside. There are a few reasons for this, but it’s best to start off with a foundation of positive associations before moving to more stressful environments. A sidewalk or patch of grass will work fine for this stage of training.

First, you want to get your dog accustomed to the feel of the leash. You can let your dog sniff and get used to the leash while they are still attached to you. If they seem frustrated or upset by the leash, you should try a different type of collar. If you start out with a negative association with the leash, your dog is much more likely to be fearful and hesitant whenever they are outside with the leash on.

## Teach “Come” Command

For an indoor training session, start off by teaching your dog the “come” command. This is a useful command to have in case your dog ever gets loose or starts to get aggressive around other dogs or people. You’ll want to keep your training indoors until your dog is completely comfortable outside with the leash on.

To start, begin by holding a treat in your hand, palm facing your dog. Let them sniff the treat and, if they try to take the treat, say the word “come.” This is the noise you want your dog to associate with the treat, so keep saying it each time you give them a treat. They may not catch on right away, but they will catch on eventually. 

## Before You Walk Together

Before you ever head outside with your dog and the leash attached, it’s important to let them get used to wearing the collar. Again, if they seem frustrated or scared, try a different collar before moving on to the next step of the training. Putting the collar on them and letting them walk around the house with it on for about five minutes a day for a week will help ease them into the feeling of wearing it.

The best way to do this is to put the collar on them, let them walk around the house for a few minutes, and then take it off. Don’t ever leave the collar on them while they are sleeping or unattended.

## Train “Heel” Command

The best way to train your dog to walk by your side is to use a “heel” command. This is a very useful tip when walking your dog around other people and dogs since it will keep them closer to you and prevent them from becoming a nuisance. You’ll want to start off with your dog wearing the collar and the leash on.

For this part of the training, you can either walk around your yard or walk in a wide open area where there is little to no human or dog traffic. When you start walking, start with a slow pace and keep a consistent rhythm. As your dog begins to walk with you, say the word “heel” and gently tug on the leash to encourage them to walk beside you.

## Important Note

When training your dog to walk on a leash, be certain to keep things positive and consistent. Avoid sudden jerking on their collar or using punishing tones. If you remain consistent, you will see results in no time. Dogs can be a great walking companion, but only if you take the time to properly train them.
