This led to Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs\\u2019 friend) proposing that they start their own computer company \\u2013 which became known as Apple Computer Inc.\nWhat follows is a detailed look into the history of Apple Inc., including details about key executives and any relevant organizational changes.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
