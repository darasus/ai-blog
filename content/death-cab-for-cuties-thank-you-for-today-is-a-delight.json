After two decades in the music business, Death Cab for Cutie have developed into one of the most beloved bands in indie rock.\nAfter their last album, Codes and Keys (2012), frontman Ben Gibbard announced that he was working on a solo project called The New Age. It was something he had been thinking about for some time but wasn\\u2019t sure when or if it would come to fruition. Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place. The album came out as a collaborative release between Ben Gibbard and Nathan Wiley under the name The Further Adventures of New Age. And three years later Death Cab For Cutie released Thank You For Today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

He would go on to become a war hero, pioneer of computer science, and one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
