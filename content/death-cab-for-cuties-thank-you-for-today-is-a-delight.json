After two decades in the music business, Death Cab for Cutie have developed into one of the most beloved bands in indie rock.\nAfter their last album, Codes and Keys (2012), frontman Ben Gibbard announced that he was working on a solo project called The New Age. It was something he had been thinking about for some time but wasn\\u2019t sure when or if it would come to fruition. Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place. The album came out as a collaborative release between Ben Gibbard and Nathan Wiley under the name The Further Adventures of New Age.

As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
