intro: >-
  When you’re in your 20s and early 30s, it can feel like there is never
  enough money. Working-age individuals in this age group are likely to be
  settling into their career and perhaps starting a family, which means expenses
  are climbing while income isn’t always keeping up.

  Even when money is tight, it doesn’t mean that young people can’t invest for the future. In fact, investing as soon as possible is one of the best things you can do to secure your financial future. The sooner you begin investing for retirement or another long-term goal, the sooner your portfolio will grow and help you achieve your goals. 

  But where should you start? Fortunately, there are plenty of accessible resources that can get you off on the right foot with your investments. Here we take a look at some of the basics of investing – what you need to know before getting started.

## What is investing?

Investing is the process of allocating funds to assets expected to generate financial returns. More simply, investing is the process of putting your money to work. When you invest in something, you’re hoping to receive financial returns in the future (in the form of interest payments or capital appreciation).

There are many different types of investments that people can choose from – such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate. The goal of each type of investment is to generate returns to the owner of the investment.

## The benefits of investing

Investing can be intimidating to get started with, but once you’ve found a strategy that works for you, you’ll be thankful that you made the effort. Here are some reasons why investing is so important:

Increased savings - Investing early and often can help you build a bigger nest egg. This means that you’ll have more money to work with when you’re ready to retire or fund other long-term goals.

Higher returns - The longer that you have to let your money grow, the more time it has to compound. Compounding is the process of earning interest on your interest, which can help you to see greater overall returns on your investments over the long haul.

## Investment lingo you need to know

Expected return or return on investment ( ROI ) - The expected rate of return on an investment is the profit that you hope to make from it. ROI is often calculated based on the initial amount of money that you put into the investment.

Investment risk - Investment risk is the chance that your investment might lose money or not provide the expected return. As a general rule, the more risk you take on with your investments, the higher the potential return.

## How to invest?

Investing can feel like a maze to navigate, with so many options out there to choose from. Luckily, there are a few straightforward steps you can take to get started:

Find your financial sweet spot - There’s no perfect investment for everyone. What works best depends on your individual situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Get educated - The best way to learn about all of the different types of investments is to read what you can about them. You can start by reading articles like this one.

Choose your investments - Once you’ve researched the types of investments that might be a good fit for you, you can start to choose which one(s) to pursue. You can often do this through an online brokerage account.

## Show me the money! Or, how to invest in 2019 and beyond

The best time to start investing was yesterday. The next best time is today! The longer you wait to start investing, the less time your investments have to grow and help you meet your goals.

Generally speaking, you should be investing as early as possible. Some people recommend that you start investing as soon as you get your first paycheck. With that said, investing comes with inherent risk, which means that there’s always a chance that your money could lose some or all of its value.

That said, if you can manage the risk and start while you’re young, you’ll have more time for your investments to compound and help you meet your long-term goals.

## Bottom line

Investing is a crucial part of any financially responsible person’s life. It allows you to not just save money for short-term goals like a vacation or a new car, but for long-term goals like retirement. Investing, however, can be an intimidating and confusing process. But the sooner you start, the better off you’ll be!

The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. This compounds and can result in you having more money in the future. With the right strategy, you can invest in a way that works for you and your financial situation.
