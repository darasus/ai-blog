## Ensuring that your dispute is resolved

One of the main advantages of mediation is that it allows you to resolve your dispute, even if the other party does not want to agree to your terms. If you proceed to trial, you can request a judgment in your favour, but you have no guarantee that the court will rule in your favour. However, in mediation, you can put forth your best arguments for how your dispute should be resolved, and the mediator can help you address the other party’s concerns. If you are able to come to an agreement, the dispute is resolved. If you are unable to do so, you have at least been able to have your say in court and have the other party address your concerns.

## Avoiding the risk of an unfavourable judgment

One of the biggest risks in going to trial is that you may lose. Even if you are in the right, there is a chance that the judge or jury may rule against you. However, in mediation, you cannot lose. If you reach an agreement with the other party, it is enforceable as if it were a contract. Therefore, if you reach an agreement in mediation, you are guaranteed to get what you want. If you go to trial, you may be awarded a favourable judgment, but there is no guarantee that the other party will be able to pay it. If the other party does not have the means to pay you, you may have to settle for less than what you are owed. In mediation, you can decide on terms that you know the other party will be able to meet.

## Preserving your relationship with the other party

Disputes often lead to strained relationships. Mediation can help you resolve your dispute while preserving your relationship with the other party. If you go to trial and win, you may put the other party in a position of having to go into debt to pay you. A financially indebted person may resent you and may not want to interact with you again. In mediation, the parties are more likely to reach an agreement that everyone can live with. An agreement is likely to reduce the tension between the parties and increase civility. If the dispute is resolved civilly, the parties may even want to continue their relationship outside of court.

## More control over the resolution of your dispute

You have far more control over the resolution of your dispute in mediation than you do in trial. In mediation, you can put forth your best arguments for the terms of the agreement. The mediator can then assist you in addressing the other party’s concerns. In contrast, in court, you only have one chance to make your case. You are restricted to the length of your argument and the questions asked by the judge. You do not know what the other party’s position is or what evidence they will present. You may have to wait weeks or months before you know how the judge rules in your favour.

## Mediation can be a win-win situation

In many cases, parties that would otherwise go to trial may be willing to mediate because they want a win-win scenario. They want an outcome that benefits both parties and is something that neither party would be able to get by going to trial. By engaging in joint problem-solving, both parties can put forth their needs and collaborate on a solution that meets both needs. Mediation can help build trust between the parties and strengthen their relationships.

## Conclusion

Disputes are inevitable, but they don’t have to end in disaster. Mediation allows parties to resolve their disputes outside of court in a less formal environment and with the help of a neutral third-party who facilitates communication and problem-solving, allowing the parties to design an outcome that works best for everyone.
