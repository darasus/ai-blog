2. More reliable connections: 5G will offer more reliable connections than 4G, which will be important for businesses that rely on data-intensive applications.

3. Faster data speeds: 5G will offer significantly faster data speeds than 4G, which will enable new applications and services.

4. Lower latency: 5G will have much lower latency than 4G, which will be important for applications that require real-time data.
