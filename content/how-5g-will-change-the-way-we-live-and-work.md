summary: 5G is the next iteration of mobile network technology. It will enable
  faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did
  before it. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow exponentially in
  the coming years, but it will require incredibly fast and reliable
  connectivity to work. 5G will be able to support much more data than 4G,
  meaning it can upload and stream video far faster than 4Gs. This will enable
  us to stream Ultra HD video content, such as movies and games, at a much
  higher standard.
intro: 5G is the next iteration of mobile network technology. It will enable
  faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did
  before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when
  it’s fully implemented. While 4G introduced much faster speeds, 5G is 10 times
  as fast again. This makes it perfect for connecting devices like self-driving
  cars or virtual assistants like Google Home or Alexa with low latency. The
  roll-out of 5G is already underway in select markets across the world, but
  it’s still early days for this technology. You may not see the benefits of 5G
  just yet – but there are some excellent reasons why you should get excited
  about this future standard.

## 5G: What does it mean for us?

When 4G was introduced, it allowed us to move away from the slower speeds of 3G and enjoy video calls, content streaming, and remote working. 5G is set to take this one step further. It will enable us use a wider range of devices and services, even those that are currently unconnected. It will make our devices stronger, more reliable, and more responsive – especially when there’s a lot of demand. Think about the way Times Square is flooded with tourists around the New Year. 4G might have struggled in that situation, but 5G will be able to handle the capacity. We’ll also be able to use our devices as we move around more. With 5G, we’ll be able to move around inside and outside buildings and not lose signal strength. This will make our lives much more convenient. It will also enable us to work remotely more often, making it easier to manage multiple locations and be productive while traveling.

## What is 5G?

5G is the next iteration of mobile network technology. It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when it’s fully implemented. While 4G introduced much faster speeds, 5G is 10 times as fast again. This makes it perfect for connecting devices like self-driving cars or virtual assistants like Google Home or Alexa with low latency. The roll-out of 5G is already underway in select markets across the world, but it’s still early days for this technology. You may not see the benefits of 5G just yet – but there are some excellent reasons why you should get excited about this future standard.

## Self-driving cars and robotics

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, but it will require incredibly fast and reliable connectivity to work. These devices – such as sensors placed around a home or a city – rely on extremely low latency to function. 5G can offer that kind of quick connection, which will make it the perfect standard for connecting smart cities and self-driving cars. When two devices are communicating via 5G, there’s usually no more than a few milliseconds between them. This enables them to react extremely quickly and precisely – which is essential for both self-driving cars and robotics. It will also allow self-driving cars to communicate with each other more efficiently, warning each other of potential hazards like traffic accidents and poor weather conditions. This will improve traffic conditions and generally make our lives easier.

## Ultra HD video and 3D VR

As more devices connect to the internet, we’re likely to see an increase in the amount of video content consumed online. This is particularly true when it comes to streaming live events, like sporting events or concerts. 5G will be able to support much more data than 4G, meaning it will be able to upload and stream video far faster than 4G. This will enable us to stream high-resolution video content, such as Ultra HD content, on demand. We’ll also be able to enjoy VR content, such as movies and video games, at a much higher standard. This will make VR far more appealing to a wider audience, and we’ll start to see an increase in the number of people using headsets regularly.

## The Internet of Things (IoT)

As more devices connect to the internet and to each other, we’ll see an increase in the number of networked services. This is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). 5G will be able to support the number of devices connected at the same time, meaning it will be able to handle all the different services that will be offered on IoT devices. We’ll also be able to exchange data between devices at a much faster rate. 5G will be able to offer much lower latency between devices, which means we’ll be able to use IoT devices in more ways. We’ll be able to control all of them remotely, even if they’re inside a building. We’ll also be able to access data from these devices at a much faster rate, which will make them much more useful.

## Synchronized services

As IoT devices and services grow, we may find that we want to share data between them. We may want to control a smart home device from a smart car, for example. With 5G, we’ll be able to do this without any hiccups or slowdowns in the connection. We may also see an increase in services that are designed to work simultaneously. We may want to be able to access data from multiple devices and services at the same time, like accessing a calendar that shows us our appointments across all our digital devices. 5G technology will enable us to do this, so we’ll be able to use our devices seamlessly. We’ll be able to rely on them to be available when we need them, and they’ll be incredibly reliable.

## Final thoughts

5G is the next iteration of mobile network technology. It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when it’s fully implemented. We’ll also be able to use our devices as we move around more. When two devices are communicating via 5G, there’s usually no more than a few milliseconds between them. We’ll be able to stream high-resolution video content, such as Ultra HD content, on demand. We’ll also be able to control all of our devices remotely, even if they’re inside a building.
