  Developers do a lot of work. As with any job, coders have to balance the
  amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that
  coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout
  the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the
  lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization,
  file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler. 

  Coding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually. Let’s take a look at some of the best coding tools that every developer should know about!

## Code Editors

The first thing that every developer should know about is the importance of using a code editor. This is the tool that developers will use most frequently, and it’s important to have a strong understanding of the different options available.

There are two basic types of code editors: text-based and GUI-based. Text editors are often simpler in design, but GUI editors tend to feature more customization tools for coding. Despite the differences between the types of code editors, the goal of each is the same: to help developers write and edit code more efficiently.

When choosing a code editor, you should keep a few things in mind. First, you will want to make sure that your code editor of choice has syntax highlighting functionality. You should also look for integrations with other coding tools. For example, it’s important to select a code editor that supports the type of language that you write in most frequently.

## Task Runners

Task runners are basically automated workflows for developers. They help you to run different tasks by combining multiple tools and commands during the development process. For example, the task runner Gulp is designed to automate image optimization and CSS processing. This type of tool is especially useful for teams working on large projects.

There are two common types of task runners: build tools and continuous integration tools. Build tools require developers to manually write code in order to set up processes. Continuous integration tools, on the other hand, are pre-programmed to run a specified set of tools automatically.

## Version Control

The next tool that every developer should know about is version control. This is a method of tracking and managing changes to code over time. More importantly, version control helps to prevent the loss of data by providing a system for rolling back changes to previous code versions.

There are tons of different version control systems available. You will have to decide which one best fits your team’s needs. The most common version control systems are Git, Mercurial, and Subversion (SVN). The best way to choose one is to find out which version control system other developers in your field use most frequently.

The key to success when using version control is to make sure that you know how to use it properly. This means following the best practices for version control. If you are new to version control, then you may want to consider taking a course on the subject as well.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is a process whereby the developer team writes the code and tests it. Once the build is successful, they integrate the updated code with the previous version of the code. Continuous integration is an important part of agile software development and DevOps. CI tools can help you automate the process, managing and monitoring your code across all environments.

There are tons of different CI tools available. You will have to decide which one best fits your team’s needs. The most common CI tools are Jenkins, Travis CI, and Codeship. The best way to choose one is to find out which CI tool other developers in your field use most frequently.

The key to success when using CI is to make sure that you set it up properly. This means setting up the CI tools correctly and following the best practices for CI. If you are new to CI, then you may want to consider taking a course on the subject as well.

## Code Review and Collaboration

The next tool that every developer should know about is code review. Code review is when you and your team members read through each other’s code to check for errors and issues. This tool helps to prevent simple mistakes from slipping past.

There are tons of different code review tools available. You will have to decide which one best fits your team’s needs. The most common code review tools are Github, PullReview, and CodeCritic. The best way to choose one is to find out which code review tool other developers in your field use most frequently.

The key to success when using code review is to make sure that everyone follows the same rules. It’s also important to keep up with the reviews and make sure that they are completed on time. If you are new to code review, then you may want to consider taking a course on the subject as well.

## Testing Tools

The last tool that every developer should know about is testing tools. One of the fastest ways to lose efficiency is to write untested code. This means that you only write code that you know works, without having to run the finished product. This saves you a lot of time that would otherwise be spent running and debugging the code before it’s working.

There are tons of different testing tools available. You will have to decide which one best fits your team’s needs. The most common testing tools are Jest, Selenium, and Pytest. The best way to choose one is to find out which testing tool other developers in your field use most frequently.

The key to success when using testing tools is to make sure that everyone follows the same rules. It’s also important to keep up with the testing and make sure that it is completed on time. If you are new to testing, then you may want to consider taking a course on the subject as well.

## Conclusion

Coding is a huge part of a developer’s job. It’s important to know the best tools to use to make the job easier and more efficient. The best tools are those that are easy to use and can help you to collaborate with your team. You can use these tools to track your progress on projects, manage your workflow, and keep everything organized.
