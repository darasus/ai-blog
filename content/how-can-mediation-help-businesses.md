summary: Mediation is a process of facilitated communication that uses an
  impartial third party (a mediator) to help two or more people explore the
  underlying issues and find solutions that are “win-win” for everyone.
  Mediation can be used to help people resolve a wide variety of personal and
  business disputes, including contractual/commercial matters, landlord/tenant
  issues, partnership/co-ownership issues, divorce/child custody issues and
  neighbourhood/community disputes. In mediation, disputants sit together with
  an impartial mediator and talk about their dispute. The mediator does not take
  sides and does not give advice.
intro: >-
  Mediation is a win-win proposition for businesses. It’s an impartial and
  confidential process that helps individuals, businesses, and organizations
  reach mutually beneficial solutions to their conflicts. These solutions are
  usually in the form of agreements called “mediation agreements” or
  “collaborative mediation agreements.” Mediation is not a one-time event but
  rather an ongoing process and collaboration between the disputants that
  involves multiple sessions. 

  Mediation can be used in all kinds of relationships where there is an opportunity to explore different ways of dealing with conflict and find win-win solutions without having to go to court or some other expensive third party adjudication. These include disputes between partners, shareholders, suppliers, customers, tenants, employees, suppliers and competitors; labor/management; landlord/tenant; divorcing spouses; members of nonprofit boards; roommates; feuding neighbours; business partners (and service providers); vendors (and clients); owners and real estate developers; executors and beneficiaries of trusts; owners and local governments etc.

## What is Mediation and How Does it Help Businesses?

Mediation is a process of facilitated communication that uses an impartial third party (a mediator) to help two or more people explore the underlying issues and find solutions that are “win-win” for everyone. In mediation, the disputants (the people who have the conflict) talk with each other and the mediator to try to resolve their dispute. Mediation can be used to help people resolve a wide variety of personal and business disputes, including contractual/commercial matters, landlord/tenant issues, partnership/co-ownership issues, divorce/child custody issues and neighbourhood/community disputes. In mediation, disputants sit down together with an impartial mediator and talk about their dispute. The mediator does not take sides and does not give advice. Instead, the mediator helps disputants examine their needs and interests and explore options for resolving the dispute. Mediation is usually done voluntarily by agreement between the parties.

## How Can Mediation Benefit Businesses?

Mediation benefits businesses because it is a voluntary process that helps individuals, businesses, and organizations reach mutually beneficial solutions to their conflicts. These solutions are usually in the form of agreements called “mediation agreements” or “collaborative mediation agreements.”

Mediation is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process and collaboration between the disputants that involves multiple sessions. These sessions involve:

- connecting the parties - exploring the parties’ underlying interests - brainstorming win-win solutions - respectful listening - exploring and resolving issues around implementation

## Through Mediation, Businesses Can Discover Win-Win Solutions.

Mediation is a collaborative process where everyone works together to explore possible solutions. Although disputants may have strong and even opposing positions, they are encouraged to suspend judgment in order to explore their interests and needs, and to reach a mutually beneficial solution. The mediator facilitates this exploration, but does not impose solutions.

A successful mediation session often involves the parties in the following activities:

- connecting with each other - exploring their underlying interests - brainstorming win-win solutions - resolving issues around implementation

## Bottom Line

There are many reasons why businesses and individuals might consider mediation, including the following:

- Mediation can resolve conflicts without having to go to court. - Mediation can help build relationships beyond the dispute. - Mediation can help businesses discover win-win solutions. - Mediation is cost-effective. - Mediation is flexible, adaptable, and timely. - Mediation is confidential. - Mediation can be used to address a wide variety of issues and relationships. - Mediation can be used to address legal and non-legal issues.

Whether the parties are co-owners of a property, business partners, neighbours, divorcing spouses, members of a nonprofit board, suppliers and clients, vendors and clients, disputants in a contract dispute etc., mediation can be used to explore and discuss issues, emotions and interests, and reach win-win solutions.
