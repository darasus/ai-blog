Mediation is a process where two parties in conflict work with a neutral third party to resolve their differences. Mediation can help businesses by providing a forum for discussion and resolution of disputes without the need for litigation. This can save businesses time and money, as well as help to preserve relationships between parties. Mediation can also help to improve communication and understanding between parties, and can provide a confidential setting for discussion of sensitive issues.
