## What is Productivity?

Productivity is how effectively we use our time. It’s about being efficient with our time and being productive with our days. It’s about getting more done within a shorter amount of time. Essentially, when we’re more productive, we are setting ourselves up for success.

There are many benefits to being more productive. For one, it can help reduce stress levels. When you’re more efficient in your day, you’re not wasting time on tasks that aren’t important. This means you have more time to dedicate towards tasks that are important – like spending time with loved ones, taking care of yourself, or dedicating time to your passions. Being more productive can also help you feel more confident in yourself.

## Why Is It Important?

As we’ve already discussed, being more productive can have many benefits. But why is it important to track your time? Why not just wing it and see what happens?

One important reason is that it can help you explore new areas of your life. For example, maybe you have a passion you’ve always wanted to explore but have never had time to focus on. Whatever it is, you can make time in your day to dedicate towards it.

Another reason is that it can help you understand your habits. If you’ve ever used an app like HabitBull, you’ll know that it tracks your daily habits so that you can break bad ones and create good habits in their place.

## How to Track Your Time

There are many ways to track your time – the best way to do so is by using a productivity app. A productivity app allows you to track your time, create goals, and set reminders for important tasks throughout your day. Some of the top productivity apps include Toggl, HabitBull, and Coach.me. Whatever app you decide to use, make sure it can track your time. This way, you can see where your time goes throughout the day. You can even set goals within the app and track your time against your goals to see how productive you are being.

## Find Out Where You Are Spending Your Time

Once you’ve got your app set up and tracking your time, it’s time to start keeping track of your time. Write down each task that you feel is important to accomplish throughout the day and when you plan to do so. During the day, keep track of your progress against each task.

At the end of the day, review your progress against each task. This will help you see where you are spending your time and where you need to make adjustments. By keeping track of your time, you can see how productive you are being and how you can make adjustments to increase your productivity.

## Plan Out Where You Want To Be

Now that you know how your time is being spent, it’s time to make adjustments. How can you be more productive with your time? There are many ways to do so – we’ve explained some below.

- Block off specific times for distractions - For example, if you know you are easily distracted and tend to get side-tracked by social media, make a rule that you won’t allow yourself to look at your phone during certain times of the day.
- Prioritize your daily tasks - Which tasks are most important to you and which are least? Which can be pushed back? If a task is particularly time-consuming, try to reduce the time required to do it.
- Work with a productivity partner - Collaborating with a partner can keep you more focused throughout the day and help you avoid getting side-tracked by distractions.
- Manage your energy levels - Think of your energy levels as a reservoir of water and manage them accordingly. Make sure you have enough energy to complete the tasks that are important to you each day.
- Break down big tasks into bite-sized chunks - This will help you avoid getting overwhelmed by large tasks. It’s easier to accomplish something if it’s broken down into manageable chunks.
