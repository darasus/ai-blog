The benefits of juicing are many and varied, but one of the most important is that it can help you to get your daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. While it is possible to get your daily recommended intake from whole fruits and vegetables, juicing them can make it much easier to do so. In addition, juicing can also help you to get more vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from your fruits and vegetables than you would if you ate them whole.
