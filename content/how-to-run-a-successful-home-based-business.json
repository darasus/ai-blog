However, there are also some downsides. Working from home means you are never really \"off\" as there will always be someone at home to answer calls, visitors knocking on the door or even delivery services coming to your address. It will also involve more responsibility than working for someone else as everything goes back to you. That\\u2019s why we have prepared this guide on how to run a successful home-based business so that you know what to expect when starting one of your own.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
