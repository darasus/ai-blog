  "summary": "Have a clear plan for how you want to spend your time and what you need to do to stay focused. Turn off notifications from apps on your phone or computer, messages from social media, and even alerts from software you use for work can all be a source of constant distraction if you don’t turn them off. If you find yourself getting distracted by certain websites or apps on a regular basis, you might want to consider blocking them. Use music or audio books to help you stay focused on what you’re doing and prevent yourself getting caught up in other distractions.",
