You need to test your code to make sure that it\\u2019s working properly.\")),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},mdx(\"p\",{parentName:\"li\"},\"Debugging - This is the process of figuring out what went wrong when your code isn\\u2019t working properly.\"))),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Variables\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A variable is essentially a container that holds data in code. More specifically, it\\u2019s a name or identifier for a part of your computer\\u2019s memory that stores information in the form of bits.

Variables are useful because they allow you to change the data they\\u2019re storing.

You can think of an operator as a verb in a sentence. In programming, an operator is written between two symbols, such as numbers and letters. Operators can either be mathematical or logical (logical operators).\nOperators are used in conditional statements. A conditional statement is a piece of code that is either true or false. By using operators and conditional statements, you can create branching paths in your code.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Loops\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A loop is a piece of code that repeats itself until a certain condition is met. There are a few different types of loops, each with their own specific purpose.
