Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques. If you\\u2019re interested in using Go to make your career as a network administrator easier or even transition into becoming one, read on for more information about why you should learn Go for Network Administration and the best places to get started with your learning today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is primarily due to the rise of social media and the prevalence of user-generated content. As a result, there are now a plethora of video editing apps that allow users to add filters to their videos, create green-screen effects, and more. Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive. However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIf you\\u2019re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI.
