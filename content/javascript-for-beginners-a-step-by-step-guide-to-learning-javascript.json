For example, modern cars can detect pedestrians with cameras rather than other sensors because the camera can identify them as non-moving objects that are smaller than usual trees and have different reflectivity from typical road markings.\nThis article covers Python, an increasingly popular language for image processing tasks. It\\u2019s a dynamic language like Ruby, which makes it easier to read and write programs. Furthermore, Python includes several useful libraries for image processing such as OpenCV (Computer Vision) and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

You might already know some other languages or have experience with concurrency so you probably are wondering how does the Go programming language help with concurrent programming.\nIf you are just getting started with Go, it might feel like a steep learning curve if you\\u2019ve never used its features before. However, as soon as you learn about channels and see how easy it is to implement them, things start making much more sense. Concurrent programming is an extremely complex topic that requires careful planning to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Fortunately, Go offers a set of standard library packages for concurrent tasks so that developers can focus on writing code instead of reinventing the wheel every time they create a new project. Let\\u2019s take a closer look at why we need concurrent programs and what Go has to offer in this regard.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
