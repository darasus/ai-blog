Python is a programming language that makes it easy for anyone to do this type of analytical work. It also excels at processing data faster than any other language. Because of these reasons, scientists are using Python more and more in their work. In fact, Python has become the most popular programming language used by scientists today.\nA scientific computing software package called \\u201COrange\\u201D inspired the creation of Python because its creator wanted to make something easier to use. Other programming languages like MATLAB were not user-friendly enough for general-purpose scientific computing so Guido van Rossum created his own version of it. He named it \\u201CPython\\u201D after the British comedy group Monty Python \\u2013 he was a fan -- and published it as an open source project in 1991 with the New York University AI Lab as its first users.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
