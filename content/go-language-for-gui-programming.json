  "summary": "Go's simple syntax and readable code make it easier for developers to understand one another’s work and make changes as requirements change. The language has built-in support for both communications with other systems and data flow within the application. Go has a syntax that is similar to languages such as C and Java, which makes it easy for developers who have worked with these languages to transition to Go. Go is still in beta, so you should plan to keep up with new language features as they’re implemented.",

Its simple syntax and powerful features have made it especially popular among programmers who specialize in building compilers and interpreters.\nGo is a general-purpose programming language with support for structured methods, visibility qualifiers, and embedded type definitions. It\\u2019s a statically typed language with support for interfaces,Ad hoc polymorphism, and type embedding.\nIn this blog post, we explore the considerations you need to make when choosing a programming language for GUI programming.

This means that you can find lots of resources to help you learn how to use the language.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Built-in Support for Networking\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One area where people who have worked in C and C++ notice the difference is in the ease with which you can do networking with Go.\nThe networked applications that we write today are Go native. They\\u2019re built in from the word \\u201Cgo\\u201D, as the saying goes.\nBecause of the ease with which Go code can access the network and other computing systems, it\\u2019s a great choice for GUI applications that require communication with remote servers or with other systems on the network.\nGo has built-in support for HTTP and HTTPS, with support for other networking protocols such as FTP and SOCKS.\nSince the language was developed by Google, the company\\u2019s experience with distributed computing is evident in Go\\u2019s handling of networking.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Built-in Concurrency Support\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Another area where Go\\u2019s origins are evident is in its support for concurrency, or the ability to execute code simultaneously.\nWith GUI applications, concurrency can be important for managing the flow of data in and out of the application itself. You might, for example, want to retrieve data from a database and display it in a table while your application is also processing a user\\u2019s request to sort or filter the table\\u2019s data.\nFor this, you need a language that supports concurrency so that your program can process the user\\u2019s request and retrieve the data from the database at the same time.\nGo\\u2019s concurrency features make it an excellent choice for GUI applications. The language has built-in support for both communications with other systems and data flow within the application.\nYou can use channels to communicate with other parts of your application and to communicate with other systems such as databases or remote servers.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go is Still in Beta\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One important thing to keep in mind when considering Go is that it\\u2019s still in beta. The language is under active development and has been since 2009, when it was first released as an experimental language.\nThis means that you can expect new features to be added to the language, and you should plan to keep up with those changes as you\\u2019re developing your GUI application.\nIf you\\u2019re working in a high-stakes environment, you may want to choose a language that\\u2019s out of beta and has a longer track record in production environments.\nHowever, if you\\u2019re working on an application that\\u2019s experimental in nature or is intended for internal use, you may want to use Go, as it will allow you to take advantage of new language features as they\\u2019re implemented.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go\\u2019s Packaging Problem\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One disadvantage of Go is its lack of a standard packaging system, which is the way that programmers organize and distribute code.\nPackaging is an important part of any programming language and is one of the things that makes it easy to work with a language.\nIf you\\u2019ve worked with a language like Java or Python, you\\u2019ve probably used the language\\u2019s built-in packaging system.\nAs you\\u2019ve probably noticed, it makes it easy to import code from other sources and to use that code in your application.\nGo doesn\\u2019t have a standard packaging system, but there are a few different ways to address this problem. You may, for example, use a version control system such as Git to manage your code.\nOr you can use a package manager such as Godep or Glide to manage the code in your application.\nAny of these options will make it easy for you to use code written by other programmers.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Go is an excellent language for GUI programming with its simple syntax, built-in support for concurrency, and easy network access. If you choose to program in Go, however, be prepared to keep up with changes to the language and its associated tools.\nIf you\\u2019re working in a high-stakes environment where the software needs to be extremely reliable, you may want to choose a language that\\u2019s out of beta. When you make that decision, keep in mind that you can still use Go for your GUI.\nChoose the language that best meets the needs of your application, and you\\u2019ll be well on your way to creating an excellent GUI application.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
