intro: >-
  In 1985, the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States was
  at its peak. Both powers were still locked in a nuclear arms race that had
  begun after World War II and continued for decades. There was no obvious way
  out of this dangerous rivalry – until that October, when Mikhail Gorbachev
  became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

  As a reformer rather than an ideologue like his predecessors, Gorbachev understood that continuing on this path could lead to catastrophe for his country. In December 1985, he traveled to New York City for a summit with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. At their first meeting, which took place in a small purple room at the UN headquarters, they began what would become a fundamental shift in international relations.

## What Happened at the Summit?

During the first ever summit between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed a treaty that dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons on both sides. The two leaders also agreed to break down the barriers between their countries and open up communication. Finally, they issued a joint statement of principles that outlined the overall goals of their relationship, including a commitment to a “lasting and constructive partnership”.

These agreements were remarkable not just for who signed them but also for when they were made. The summit took place in a much different international environment than the one that existed when the two superpowers first began facing off with each other.

## Problems in Soviet Society

As a young man, Gorbachev was a farm boy in the southern region of Russia. His rural upbringing left him with an intimate knowledge of the problems in Soviet society. During his travels as a party official, he saw how the Soviet system was failing ordinary people. They were exhausted by constant shortages of basic goods, which were the result of the Soviet command economy.
Gorbachev had an ambitious vision for change. He wanted to break up the Soviet Union’s rigid system of planning that relied on government-set production quotas and state distribution of goods. He also wanted to open up Soviet society, which he saw as deeply conservative and resistant to reform.

## The Shifting Environment

But before he could achieve his goals, Gorbachev had to deal with a rapidly changing international environment. The United States and the Soviet Union had been bound together in a relationship of mutual hostility since the end of World War II. They had fought each other to a draw during the Cold War – a period of competition and fear between two superpowers that was never fought through direct military confrontation.

However, by the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union was in a weaker position than ever before. The U.S. had begun a military buildup that had put significant pressure on the Soviet Union. At the same time, the growing economic power of Japan and West Germany, as well as the energy revolution caused by the rise of oil and gas from the Middle East, had shifted the geopolitical balance of power.

## Change Comes to Soviet Politics & Foreign Policy

Gorbachev’s domestic reforms led to a significant change in Soviet politics. He allowed non-Marxist thinking to enter the political discourse. He also gave a voice to the Soviet people, who were tired of the status quo. And he brought new people into the top echelons of the party, including younger officials who were more open to change.
Gorbachev’s policies of perestroika and glasnost, which literally mean “restructuring” and “openness”, were also reflected in his approach to foreign policy. He pursued a more cooperative relationship with the United States and the West in general. He did not try to impose a socialist model on other countries. He also agreed to significant arms control agreements that would have been unimaginable during the Cold War.

## Conclusion

The summit between Reagan and Gorbachev turned out to be a transformative moment in history. For the first time since the end of World War II, there was a genuine reduction in the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. They also signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which set the goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons by half.

Gorbachev and Reagan also worked together on other issues of mutual concern. They signed a joint statement on human rights, in which they committed themselves to “a society governed by the rule of law”. They also issued a joint statement on “a new era of constructive East-West relations”.
