The Cold War was a time of great tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. It was a time when the world was divided into two camps, each with its own ideology and way of life. The Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This event marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era in international relations.
