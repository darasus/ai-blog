IOTA is a cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of Things. IOTA is different from other cryptocurrencies because it uses a directed acyclic graph instead of a blockchain. This allows IOTA to have no transaction fees and be scalable. IOTA is still in development and is not yet available on exchanges.
