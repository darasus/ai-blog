summary: IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger designed specifically for
  the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is a cryptocurrency used to execute
  transactions between devices on the IoT. IOTA’s distributed ledger differs
  from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic
  graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph
  architecture called a “tangle” The main advantage of the tangle architecture
  is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.
intro: >-
  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices, sensors, software,
  and services that can connect directly with other devices. IoT technology is
  everywhere today – from your car to your television to even your
  refrigerator. 

  The IoT is made up of all the connected devices that monitor data such as operational parameters, performance, usage, etc. It allows users to interact with these connected devices through virtual applications or digital user interfaces.

  Users and businesses can use the internet of things to track the locations of their assets, monitor usage patterns and detect problems before they become serious problems. This article explains why you should invest in Iota and its pros and cons as an investment opportunity.

## What is IOTA?

IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger or blockchain designed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is a cryptocurrency used to execute transactions between devices on the IoT.
The Internet of Things is a network of devices, sensors, software, and services that can connect directly with other devices. IoT technology is everywhere today – from your car to your television to even your refrigerator.
The Internet of Things is made up of all the connected devices that monitor data such as operational parameters, performance, usage, etc. It allows users to interact with these connected devices through virtual applications or digital user interfaces.
IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle.”

## Why invest in Iota?

IOTA has been designed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem. It is a scalable distributed ledger that enables Machine-to-Machine (M2M) transactions between IoT devices.
IOTA is designed to be lightweight and scalable, with almost zero transaction fees. Therefore, it works better for small micro-payments between IoT devices as well as large payments between organizations
IOTA has been backed by many industry giants like Microsoft, Bosch, Fujitsu, VW, and others. It has also partnered with other blockchain companies to integrate their services with IOTA.
IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle.”
IOTA’s distributed ledger has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. Therefore, it can easily handle the high throughput requirements of IoT devices.
IOTA is an open source distributed ledger and the company behind it is non-profit and open source. Therefore, it is not governed by any single organization or government.

## IOTA Features

- Scalability: IOTA has been designed to handle high throughput requirements of IoT devices. It can scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second.

- Decentralized Network: IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices.

- Zero Transaction Fees: IOTA has been designed for micro-payments between IoT devices. Therefore, it works better for small micro-payments between IoT devices as well as large payments between organizations.

- Ease of use: IOTA has been designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Therefore, it works well with minimal hardware and software integration requirements.

## IOTA Limitations

- Centralization: IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices. However, it is technically not completely decentralized. It is partially centralized, as it has been designed to work under specific circumstances.

- Open Source: IOTA is an open source distributed ledger, and the company behind it is non-profit and open source. Therefore, it is not governed by any single organization or government. However, its open source nature can be a disadvantage for some organizations.

- Novel Architecture: IOTA has been designed with a novel architecture. Therefore, its long-term scalability and security are uncertain.

- Security: IOTA’s distributed ledger has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. Therefore, it can easily handle the high throughput requirements of IoT devices. However, in the event of a security breach, it is uncertain how the distributed ledger will handle it.

## The Tangle - Iota's Distributed Ledger

The tangle is IOTA’s distributed ledger architecture. It is a directed acyclic graph that has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. The main advantage of the tangle architecture is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.
The main drawback of the tangle architecture is that it is not as secure as a blockchain architecture like in Bitcoin. The tangle architecture is still in beta, and its long-term scalability and security are uncertain.
