  a member of the public’s place to be able to have a comment on what you’re
  going to have to do, or if you want to make it easy for the first person to
  ask for their own way to go, or when you can have the first way to do this is
  to talk about how much to do the best of the internet, or how much can be the
  third person to get the first step of the series of things that’ve been done

## Start With The Basics

The first thing you need is a business plan. This is going to be your strategy for success and the roadmap for your company. If you want to be successful, you need a business plan. No matter what business you want to start, you need a business plan. The business plan helps you answer key questions. How much money do you need to start your business? Where will the money come from? How long before you break even? How long before you can quit your day job? Without a business plan, you don’t have a clear idea of what you need, when it’s coming, and when you can start counting your profits.

If you’re just starting out, a great way to save money is to go with a virtual office. You don’t need a brick-and-mortar office to get your business off the ground. In fact, you might be better off without one. Yes, it’s important to have a physical presence, but it doesn’t have to come with a physical address. You can rent virtual office space for as little as $35 per month and not only get your phone number with a local area code, but receive your mail as well.

## Hiring Is Essential

Whenever you can, outsource. Outsourcing as many tasks as you can will save you both time and money – two things that are critical to a small business. If you have to do everything yourself, you’re going to run out of time and burn through your cash reserves quickly. If you outsource basic functions like accounting, bookkeeping, customer support, research, and product development, you bring in experts to do the work while you grow your company.

There are plenty of ways to save money on hiring, too. For example, when it comes to hiring employees, you don’t have to offer the most competitive salaries in the industry. You need people who are qualified and capable of doing the job. If you’re just starting out, you might not be able to attract the best employees with high salaries. Instead, you can offer benefits, like paid vacation and health insurance, that larger companies can’t afford to provide yet.

## Networking Is Key

One of the most effective ways you can promote your business is through word of mouth. When people like your product or service, they will tell their friends about it. If you want this to happen, you need to make it easy for your clients to talk about you. One way to do this is through networking.

You don’t have to have a large budget to network effectively. You can start by attending small business meet-ups in your area or joining online forums where your industry is discussed. You can also make a point of creating a relationship with your customers. This can include asking for their feedback (and taking it seriously) as well as thanking them for their business.

## Leverage Free Platforms

If you want to build a website, but don’t have the money to build it from scratch, you can look at free website platforms like WordPress or Squarespace. These sites already have millions of customers and have been proven to be safe and reliable. They also make it easy to use your own domain name and hosting. This will cost you nothing (aside from your time for set-up and maintenance) and you can use it to host your website and online store.

If you want to market through social media, but don’t have the budget to pay for ads, there are ways to get those same customers’ eyes on your products and services without spending a dime. You can create a Facebook page and a Twitter account and use them to interact with your customers and potential clients. You can also use these platforms to share your content with your followers and ask them to like and comment on what you’re posting.

## Track Your Marketing ROI

This is especially important if you’re using paid advertising as a marketing tactic. Without tracking your return on investment, you don’t know how effective your ads are and you can’t retool your ads if they aren’t bringing in customers. You can track your marketing ROI in a few different ways. If you are using an ad platform like Google Adwords, you can install their free analytics tools to see how many people click on your ads and where they are clicking from. You can also use a free tracking app like Google Analytics to track your website traffic and conversions.

You don’t have to spend a fortune to get your business up and running. You just need to be smart about your spending and be willing to do some things yourself that you may have otherwise outsourced. Once you’re up and running, you can always save money by making sure you’re using the right tools and tracking your marketing ROI to make sure your ads are bringing in the right kind of customers.
