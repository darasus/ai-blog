  Starting a business from scratch can be overwhelming and challenging. You
  need to make crucial decisions about what type of business to start, who your
  potential customers are, how much capital you have available, where you will
  operate and many more important details. 

  Business planning is an essential part of starting any new venture. A business plan helps you clarify your ideas, set measurable goals and give you the support needed to succeed. It also serves as a document that explains why someone should invest money in your company. 

  A well-written business plan will not only help you get financing but can also assist you in operating your business more effectively once it is up and running. The process isn’t easy, but with the right tools and advice, it’s not as complicated as it may seem either. Let’s take a look at some useful advice on how to create a business plan that works for you

## Know Your Audience

Before you can begin creating your business plan, you must know who your target market is. A thorough knowledge of your potential customers will help you clarify your business concept, determine your product or service offering, and organize your marketing strategy.

Your market research should include information about the following:

- Demographics. Who are your customers? What are their ages, ethnicities, incomes, genders, and occupations?
- Sales potential. How many people are in the market for your product or service?
- Competition. Who are your competitors, and how do you differentiate yourself from them?
- Location. Where are your customers located? Are there any geographic limitations on your business?

## Identify Your Needs

The next step in creating a business plan is to identify your company’s needs. Start by assessing your situation, strengths and weaknesses. Think about the following questions:

- What are your company’s financial needs? How much capital do you need to start your business, and how do you plan to raise that money?
- What human resources do you need? Do you have the staff expertise to handle the tasks involved in operating your company, or will you need to hire personnel to fill in the gaps?
- What resources do you need? What equipment, products, or materials are required to run your business?

## Decide On Your Goals

The next step in creating a business plan is to decide on your goals. Your business plan should include short-term and long-term goals, as well as strategies for meeting those goals.
- Short-term goals. Short-term goals are typically achieved within one year. Examples might be securing financing for your company, setting up your company’s operations, and hiring employees.
- Long-term goals. Long-term goals are typically achieved within five years. Examples might be increasing your company’s profits, expanding your operations, and taking your company public.
- Strategies. The strategies you include in your business plan will depend on the goals you set. You may need to set milestones, such as meeting with investors or suppliers, to reach certain goals. You can also break down your goals into manageable chunks and set deadlines and action steps for achieving them.

## Estimate Your Costs

One of the first steps in creating a business plan is to estimate your costs. Start by making a list of all the expenses you expect to incur when setting up your company. Once you have the list compiled, you can prioritize the items and start looking for potential savings.

- Capital and financing costs. Your immediate costs will be related to capital and financing. You will need money for setting up your operations, purchasing inventory, and hiring employees, among other things.

- Initial expenses. Your initial expenses will be tied to setting up your office, hiring a lawyer to draft your business plan and other important tasks.
- Ongoing expenses. Ongoing expenses include utility bills, insurance and other expenses related to keeping your business running such as payroll and office supplies.

## Create Your Product Or Service Offering

The next step in creating a business plan is to create your product or service offering. You can’t start marketing your product or service if you don’t know what it is, so start by clearly defining it in your business plan.
- Description. Start by describing your product or service offering in one or two sentences. Be specific and clear about what you are offering and to whom.
- Benefits. Next, explain how your product or service offering benefits your customers. Clearly outline what they will get from purchasing your product or using your service.
- Your marketing strategy. Once you have a clear description of your product or service offering, you need to decide how you will market it. Will you sell online or in a brick-and-mortar store? What are your sales channels?

## Determining The Bottom Line

The next step in creating a business plan is to determine your bottom line. You need to know how much money your company will generate and how much it will cost to run so you can forecast your profit margin.
- Expenses. Start by recording all of your business expenses. List each item and indicate whether it is an ongoing expense (salaries) or a one-time expense (equipment).
- Revenues. Next, list all of your potential sources of revenue. Include both current and potential customers.
- Forecast. Once you have all of the data, you can forecast the bottom line for your business.
- Cash flow. Keep in mind that the cash flow for your business will likely fluctuate from month to month. This is why it’s important to use a cash flow forecast (as opposed to a profit and loss statement) when creating your business plan.

## Wrapping Up

Once you have written your business plan, review it from beginning to end, and make sure that everything is consistent and makes sense. Ask trusted friends, family members, and colleagues to review the document for you and provide feedback.
A business plan is only effective if it is written and presented properly, so proofread your business plan carefully and make sure that it is well organized, easy to understand, and comprehensive.
Your business plan will be a useful tool throughout the life of your company. You can use it to obtain financing, manage your operations, and obtain other benefits.

Also, keep in mind that while a business plan is extremely important to the success of any business, it shouldn’t be treated as a static document. You can — and should — make adjustments as needed over time.
