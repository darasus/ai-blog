## The rise of remote work

Remote work has been around for decades, but as digital technology has advanced, more and more employers have invested in tools that allow them to manage teams across locations. That includes everything from file transfer services to video conferencing. What’s more, the remote work trend has spilled over into many traditionally office-based roles, including software engineering and content strategy. With the rise of coworking spaces, virtual reality, and other remote work-friendly innovations, it’s clear that remote work has become an indispensable way of doing business — and many companies have caught on. According to one survey of over 5,000 U.S. adults, over 60% of respondents reported working remotely at least some of the time. As millennials grow into their careers and make up an increasingly large percentage of the working population, remote work will likely continue to grow in popularity.

## More companies going remote

As remote work becomes more widely accepted and available, more companies are turning to it as a way to attract top talent. From Hubspot to American Express, more remote work policies have been popping up on company websites. And it’s not just marketing or IT teams who are being given the option to work remotely — many companies have expanded their remote work offerings to include sales, finance, and other roles that traditionally require an office presence.
As more companies become aware of the quality talent available to them outside of the office, they’ll continue to expand their remote work policies. And employees will likely continue to jump at the chance to work remotely, especially millennials who grew up with remote working as the norm. Employers who want to stay competitive in the hiring market will need to keep up with this growing trend.

## The gig economy and independent contractors

The rise of the gig economy goes hand in hand with the rise of remote work. As more companies adopt remote work and on-demand employee policies, more people are turning to independent contractor roles. While the distinction between the two can seem hazy, the difference lies in more than just the setting in which the work is done.
People who work as independent contractors are often self-employed. They have very little in the way of benefits or security, but they are given autonomy in how they do their work and are responsible for paying their own taxes. On the other hand, gig economy workers are usually employed by a third-party company that offers them benefits and is responsible for their taxes.
While many enjoy the flexibility of remote work, others are turning to independent contractor roles as a way to earn additional income.

## Baby Boomers are helping change the workplace too

As more millennials enter the workforce and demand remote work, companies are starting to adapt. But remote work isn’t just a millennial thing. As Baby Boomers retire and enter the gig economy, they’re bringing a lot of experience and know-how to freelance work, making remote hiring more accessible to people across the board. In fact, one study found that nearly half of older workers are interested in remote work, and as more of them look to transition out of full-time employment, they can help fuel the demand for gig economy work.

## Key skills for the future: soft skills, AI and robotics

With all of the advancements in technology that have helped reshape the way we work, it’s important to stay on top of the skills that will keep you competitive. To stay up to date, it’s important to keep an eye on what new technologies are coming and what skills are necessary to make the most of them.

As more companies turn to automation and AI, soft skills like communication and collaboration become increasingly vital. You might find that you need to brush up on coding or other tech skills, but you also need to be able to work well with others who aren’t necessarily in your field.
As the world of work becomes increasingly automated, people will need a new set of skills to stay competitive. That means investing in soft skills like communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. These skills will allow you to work in tandem with robots and AI systems, and they could very well be the difference between being hired and getting left behind.

## Conclusion

The world of work is changing, and it’s important to keep up with the trends if you want to stay competitive. From more companies offering remote work to an increased need for soft skills, there are many factors impacting the future of work. If you want to keep advancing your career, it’s important to stay informed.
