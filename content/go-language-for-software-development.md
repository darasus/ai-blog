Go is a programming language created at Google. It is a statically typed, compiled language with syntax loosely based on that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.

The language was announced in November 2009, and version 1.0 was released in March 2012. Version 1.13 added support for WebAssembly. Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects.

The Go programming language was designed to be an efficient, concurrent, and safe language for systems programming. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected with an emphasis on simplicity and readability.

The Go programming language was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google in 2007. It was inspired by the programming language Limbo, which was designed by Pike while working on the Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

The name "Go" was chosen because of its similarity to the word "golf", which is a sport that the creators of the language enjoy. The logo for the language is a lowercase "g" inside of a circle.

The Go programming language is an open source project with an active community. The language is managed by a team at Google and the core team members are all employed by Google. The team members are:

Rob Pike (robpike@google.com)

Robert Griesemer (gri@google.com)

Ian Lance Taylor (iant@google.com)

Russ Cox (rsc@google.com)

The Go programming language is available under the BSD license. The source code for the Go programming language is available at https://golang.org/. The Go programming language is also available for many different platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and more.

The Go programming language has been used in production at Google since 2008 and has been used in many other organizations since then. The Go programming language has also been used to build many open source projects, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
