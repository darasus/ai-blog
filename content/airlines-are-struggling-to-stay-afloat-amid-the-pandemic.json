Airlines have been hit hard as apprehensive travelers steer clear of travel. In addition to cancellations and red-eye flights, airlines are grappling with empty seats on normally packed flights, steep drops in ticket prices, and a burst of unused plane leases. To make matters worse, the pandemic has taken its toll on their bottom line.\nFor example, Travelers Insurance recently announced that it will no longer provide insurance coverage for overseas workers at influenza-stricken companies. As a result, some airlines have cut back or ceased all services to areas affected by the flu, while others have re-negotiated lease contracts to reduce costs.
