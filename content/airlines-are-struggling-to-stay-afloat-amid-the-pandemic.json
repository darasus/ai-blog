  "summary": "The pandemic is a result of the H1N1 virus, also known as “swine flu” This virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009. It has already claimed more than 4,000 lives since its emergence in October 2018. The risk of contracting the flu is high, and the risk of infecting others is even higher. The CDC has advised against all but essential travel, particularly on commercial flights. This travel warning has led to a 35 percent decline in air travelers in the U.S. alone.",
