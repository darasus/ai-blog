The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so.
