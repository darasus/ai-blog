Many developers have taken a liking to Go because of its simplicity, readability, and faster compilation time. Other benefits include having little to no runtime overhead, being memory safe by default, and being able to compile Go code as standalone binaries or as packages (called packages in Go).\nGo is an ideal language for scientific computing due to its performance, ease of use, and standard libraries. This blog will outline reasons you should consider using Go for your next project that involves heavy scientific computing.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
