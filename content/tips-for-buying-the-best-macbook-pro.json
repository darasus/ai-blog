It's not the most powerful, but it’s powerful enough for most people, and it's great for everyday use. The 15-inch version is the best option for people who need more power. The Touch Bar is only available with a Touch Bar, so if you don’t need it, you need to go with the 15-in version. The 17-inch model is the biggest, with a battery life of up to 10 hours, and is great for watching movies and TV shows. It comes in both the 13-in and the Touch Bar version.",
