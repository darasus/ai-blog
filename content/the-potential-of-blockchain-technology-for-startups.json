Thanks to technological advancements, we can do business with people all over the world. In fact, people have done business with people in other countries for a very long time. Today, however, businesses must go farther and deeper to reach new customers and markets with this type of global visibility. Businesses must also take advantage of technology that makes it easier and cheaper to connect with people from other countries.\nIndeed, businesses should use every tool possible to do business globally at lower costs, avoid intermediaries when possible and reduce risks as much as possible. The best way to achieve these objectives is through the use of disruptive technologies like blockchain.

It\\u2019s the first example of a cryptocurrency, an asset that can be easily transferred between users (or \"adapters\") and also has a fixed supply. This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.\nThe creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\nThere are a number of factors that could continue to drive demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
