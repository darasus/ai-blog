  "summary": "Mediation is a process of facilitated communication that uses an impartial third party (a mediator) to help two or more people explore the underlying issues and find solutions that are “win-win” for everyone. Mediation can be used to help people resolve a wide variety of personal and business disputes, including contractual/commercial matters, landlord/tenant issues, partnership/co-ownership issues, divorce/child custody issues and neighbourhood/community disputes. In mediation, disputants sit together with an impartial mediator and talk about their dispute. The mediator does not take sides and does not give advice.",
