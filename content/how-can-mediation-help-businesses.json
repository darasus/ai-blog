  "summary": "Mediation is a process of facilitated communication that uses an impartial third party (a mediator) to help two or more people explore the underlying issues and find solutions that are “win-win” for everyone. Mediation can be used to help people resolve a wide variety of personal and business disputes, including contractual/commercial matters, landlord/tenant issues, partnership/co-ownership issues, divorce/child custody issues and neighbourhood/community disputes. In mediation, disputants sit together with an impartial mediator and talk about their dispute. The mediator does not take sides and does not give advice.",
  "intro": "Mediation is a win-win proposition for businesses. It’s an impartial and confidential process that helps individuals, businesses, and organizations reach mutually beneficial solutions to their conflicts. These solutions are usually in the form of agreements called “mediation agreements” or “collaborative mediation agreements.” Mediation is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process and collaboration between the disputants that involves multiple sessions. \nMediation can be used in all kinds of relationships where there is an opportunity to explore different ways of dealing with conflict and find win-win solutions without having to go to court or some other expensive third party adjudication. These include disputes between partners, shareholders, suppliers, customers, tenants, employees, suppliers and competitors; labor/management; landlord/tenant; divorcing spouses; members of nonprofit boards; roommates; feuding neighbours; business partners (and service providers); vendors (and clients); owners and real estate developers; executors and beneficiaries of trusts; owners and local governments etc.",
