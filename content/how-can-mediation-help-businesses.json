It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
