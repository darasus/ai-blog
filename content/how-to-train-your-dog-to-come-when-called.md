One of the most important things you can do for your dog is to train them to come when called. This is a basic obedience command that can help keep them safe and make them more enjoyable to be around. Here are a few tips on how to train your dog to come when called: 

1. Start with basic obedience commands such as sit, stay, and down. Once your dog has a good understanding of these commands, you can begin working on coming when called.

2. Use positive reinforcement when training your dog. This means offering them treats or praise when they do what you ask.

3. Make sure you are consistent with your commands. If you only sometimes ask your dog to come, they will only sometimes obey.

4. Practice in different environments so that your dog can learn to come when called no matter where they are.

5. Be patient while training your dog. Like with most things in life, learning to come when called takes time and patience.
