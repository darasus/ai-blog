Software engineers need to be constantly on the lookout for new tools that make their lives easier and their work more efficient.\nIf you\\u2019re a software engineer, chances are you frequently juggle multiple projects, apps, and codebases \\u2014 all while keeping track of specific details like version numbers, dependencies, and APIs. It can be challenging to keep all those details straight in your head, let alone find them when you need them again later on.
