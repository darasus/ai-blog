Fussing and fuming won\\u2019t make them any less likely to follow you anywhere, or to notice that bag of chips you just carelessly threw on the table. Dogs are dogs, which means they will follow your slightest lead and chip in with their two cents at every opportunity. Sadly, this also means that it\\u2019s not uncommon for dogs to get into things they shouldn\\u2019t. You like peace and quiet? Not so much when there\\u2019s a dog around. You like keeping your things? Good luck with that.\nBut luckily, with some bit of training and persistence, you can teach your pup exactly what\\u2019s off limits and exactly where to leave it instead. Best of all, all these tricks take very little time and effort on our part. It doesn\\u2019t have to be hard! Let\\u2019s check out how!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The answer is: quite a lot. A single photograph has the power to change opinions, shape perceptions, and even alter the course of history.\nLet\\u2019s take for example, the most iconic cat photos of all time; whether you love them or hate them, their fame cannot be denied. These are images that have been shared on social media sites and printed on t-shirts and posters across the globe. And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there\\u2019s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
