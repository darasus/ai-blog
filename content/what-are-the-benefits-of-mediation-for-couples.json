It may take time for them to make you feel uneasy or distrustful of your partner. But it also could be something that crops up almost immediately \\u2013 especially if you meet them in a place like a nightclub, bar or other place where people tend to hookup without much thought as to who they\\u2019re hooking up with!

In fact, numerous experts see mediation as the future of dispute resolution. It\\u2019s no wonder, then, that businesses are taking note and incorporating mediation into their organizational culture as a preemptive measure against possible legal action.\nMediation is a collaborative negotiation process with a neutral third party known as a mediator who helps individuals or parties in conflict reach an agreement that's fair to all involved. Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.
