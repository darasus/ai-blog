It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when it\\u2019s fully implemented. While 4G introduced much faster speeds, 5G is 10 times as fast again. This makes it perfect for connecting devices like self-driving cars or virtual assistants like Google Home or Alexa with low latency. The roll-out of 5G is already underway in select markets across the world, but it\\u2019s still early days for this technology. You may not see the benefits of 5G just yet \\u2013 but there are some excellent reasons why you should get excited about this future standard.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
