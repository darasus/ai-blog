  "title": "Facebook's user data: How the social media giant collects and sells our information",
  "summary": "Facebook collects and sells user data to advertisers. The more data Facebook has about you, the more effective these ads will be. Facebook can collect this information in a few different ways: through your posts, through your “like” clicks on other people’s posts, and through your online purchases. Facebook also collects information about non-users who have email addresses. Facebook promises users that it will not sell their Social Security number, credit card information, health information, or financial information, but it does sell other information.",
  "intro": "Social media is a double-edged sword. While these platforms can be wonderful tools for keeping in touch with friends and family, they also come with risks — especially when it comes to your personal data. Facebook users can now read again and again how their data was misused by the company and its partners. There are constant scandals around this subject. Social media users need to be more conscious about what they share and how they share it. \nUnfortunately, most of us don’t read user agreements or privacy policies until something goes wrong—and that’s too bad, because those documents often contain important information about how your personal information is going to be used by that service provider. In many cases, you’ll see an “OK” button beside the user agreement, meaning you must agree to continue using the app or site if you want to proceed any further.",
  "content": "## Facebook’s business model\n\nFacebook is a free service, and it’s supposed to remain that way for users. But how does Facebook make money? The short answer is advertising. The long answer is as follows: Facebook users create a profile, and that profile is used to distribute targeted ads to those users. These ads are based on information Facebook collects from users, such as their employment history, hobbies, education, relationship status, and the number of children they have. Facebook also collects information from non-users who have email addresses.\n\nFacebook can collect this information in a few different ways: through your posts, through your “like” clicks on other people’s posts, through your online purchases, and through your internet searches. In other words, Facebook has your pattern of life pretty well covered.\n\n## Why is Facebook so desperate for our data?\n\nFacebook needs as many people to sign up for the service as possible so that they can have access to as much user data as possible. This is because the company's business model is based on collecting and selling user data.\n\nFacebook makes money from the ads it places next to your posts and photos. These ads are tailored to your interests based on the information you provide, the things you click on, and what you ignore. The more data Facebook has about you, the more effective these ads will be.\n\nThe more effective the ads are, the more money Facebook makes.\n\n## How does Facebook collect user data?\n\nThe amount of information Facebook can collect from you depends on your privacy settings. If you set your privacy settings to \"Public,\" then Facebook can collect almost any information it wants. Otherwise, it can still collect quite a bit of information.\n\nFacebook can collect your name and any other alias you may use, your birthday, your location, your current employment, your educational background, your relationship status, the number of children you have, and your friends.\n\nFacebook can also collect your pattern of life, including your internet browsing history, the purchases you make, the movies you watch, and the books you read. It can also collect the apps you use, the music you listen to, and the websites you visit.\n\n## Facebook also sells your information to ad companies.\n\nFacebook doesn't just collect your information for its own use; it also sells user data to advertisers. It's how it makes money from the free service. Facebook promises users that it will not sell their Social Security number, credit card information, health information, or financial information. But it does sell other information, like where you are, what you like, who your friends are, and what you click on. Facebook even has a portal where businesses can buy and sell user data.\n\nFacebook also allows marketers to create online advertisements based on user interests, which are based on the user's online activity. This can also be based on race, ethnicity, gender, relationship status, financial status, educational background, political views, and health information.\n\n## What kind of user data does Facebook collect?\n\nFacebook collects all kinds of information, including information from users and information about users. Information from users includes your name, birthday, current city, gender, education, employment, relationship status, and religious views. Information about users includes browsing history, app usage, music listened to, books read, friends, family members, games played, movies watched, purchases made, travel plans, and more.\n\nFacebook accesses this information in a few different ways, as detailed above. But it does not only collect information from users. It also collects information about non-users who have email addresses.\n\n## Facebook also tracks you on other sites.\n\nFacebook uses a tracking method called “social graph API,” which tracks your online activity even when you’re not on Facebook. This includes reading the articles you click on, watching the videos you play, and browsing the products you look at.\n\nFacebook can collect this information in several ways:\n\n- Through the Like button: The Like button lets other websites know that a Facebook user has visited that page. It also lets Facebook collect information about the page’s content that you might not have otherwise shared with the social network.\n- Through the share button: The Share button lets you publish an article’s text and URL to your Facebook profile. The social network can collect the title of the article, its URL, and information about the device you used to publish it.\n- Through the Facebook Pixel: This is a piece of code that lets websites inform Facebook whenever a user visits the site. It allows Facebook to track your online activity, including which other websites you visit.\n- From other apps: If you’ve ever used Facebook to log into another app, like Tinder or Spotify, the social network can collect information about your activity within those apps.\n\n## Bottom line: How to protect your user data and control your privacy on Facebook\n\nUltimately, the only way to protect your user data on Facebook is to be very cautious about what you put on the site. You can also make an effort to control your privacy settings, but the only way to fully protect yourself is to delete your Facebook account. If you do decide to delete your account, be sure to download a copy of your data beforehand.\n\nThe best way to protect your user data on Facebook is to be cautious about what you share. First, make sure your privacy settings are set to Friends Only. This will keep your information from getting into the hands of third parties. Next, consider creating a second account for more sensitive communications. And finally, if you ever feel like you’re being too careful, remember that you don’t have to participate."
