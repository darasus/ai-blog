## What is an RIA?

A rich internet application is a meaningful application running on the internet. These types of applications are highly interactive and have a more user-friendly interface than traditional websites. They are usually created using JavaScript and HTML 5.

Compared to traditional websites, rich internet applications have two major advantages. Firstly they can be easily integrated into any operating system or device without the need for additional software. Secondly, they can be easily accessed by any user regardless of their computer literacy.

## Why Java?

As stated earlier, RIAs are built on web technologies and thus can be built using any programming language. But what makes Java a particularly good choice when it comes to building RIAs? Below are some of the key advantages of using Java when building RIAs.

Java is platform independent, which means that a single piece of code can run on any device, regardless of the operating system. This is extremely useful in the context of RIAs, as it means that the same application can be used on any device, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
Java is open source and this is extremely helpful since it enables developers to use open source libraries and frameworks. It also allows developers to customize and fix any issues they may run into.

## Key features of a RIAS

- Distribution - The system must be able to deliver an application to multiple locations. In a classic web application, this is achieved by hosting the application on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a similar service. In a Java RIA, it is achieved by packaging the application as a single Jar file.

- Security - When building any application, security must be a top priority. Luckily, Java comes with built-in support for secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections.

- Performance - Rich Internet Applications are often used to replace existing applications that perform critical functions, such as healthcare, transportation, and financial services. Though these RIA applications may look great and be easy to use, if they don't perform as expected, they may cause significant damage. Java RIA applications are built to perform efficiently, which is achieved by running them in a JVM, on a single computer. This eliminates the need for distributed computing environments, such as virtual machines.

- Integration with other apps - RIA applications are typically used to provide a single service at a time. For example, they may be used to collect personal health data, make financial transactions, or provide customer support. While they may provide a great user experience, they rarely work with other applications. Java RIA applications can be easily integrated with other applications.

## JVM and Java Platform, the reason behind choosing Java

In the world of programming languages, there are few languages as mature, flexible, and comprehensive as Java. The language has been around for more than two decades, and is used by a wide variety of organizations in diverse industries.
Java has a reputation for being reliable, secure, and scalable, which makes it a great choice for developing RIAs.
For a developer, Java is an easy language to understand and learn. Javaâ€™s syntax is very similar to that of C/C++, which means that developers who know C/C++ will have no problem picking up Java.
Moreover, Java is a platform-independent language, which means that the same piece of code can run on any device, regardless of the operating system. This is extremely useful in the context of RIAs, as it means that the same application can be used on any device, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

## Summary

There are many benefits of using Java to create rich internet applications. The language is platform independent, secure, and can easily be integrated with other apps. Moreover, since it can run on any device, a single piece of code can be used to build an application that can be accessed on any device, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
