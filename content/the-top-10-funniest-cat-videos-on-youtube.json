In fact, numerous experts see mediation as the future of dispute resolution. It\\u2019s no wonder, then, that businesses are taking note and incorporating mediation into their organizational culture as a preemptive measure against possible legal action.\nMediation is a collaborative negotiation process with a neutral third party known as a mediator who helps individuals or parties in conflict reach an agreement that's fair to all involved. Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.

As the weather gets warmer, so does our house. Dirt and grime that has accumulated over the long winter months begins to dissipate as we put away all of our heavy coats, hats, and gloves. With fewer layers to trap it, dust, germs, and other nasty particles are exposed for what they really are: gross!\nWe all know that a tidy home is a happy one. Keeping a tidy household at all times can be challenging. The pressures of work and other responsibilities often get in the way of keeping things clean and organized.

It\\u2019s a way of resolving disputes that is less adversarial than litigation and usually cheaper, faster, and more private than other methods. Mediation is also collaborative as well as neutral. The mediator acts as a neutral party who helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable manner.\nIn mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It\\u2019s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It\\u2019s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
