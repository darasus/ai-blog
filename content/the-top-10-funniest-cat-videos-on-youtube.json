There\\u2019s shopping, traveling and entertaining to consider. And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response.

It\\u2019t not the same thing as arbitration or negotiation. Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral third party, the mediator, assists others in exploring issues, managing conflict, and solving problems in an effort to resolve conflict and move forward. The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequence. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It\\u2019t win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their dispute.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer these services pro bono publico, which means \\u201Cfor the good of the public\\u201D without charge.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
