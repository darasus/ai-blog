Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.

Mediation isn\\u2019t just for couples who are breaking up or divorcing; it can be useful in resolving disputes with co-workers, business partners, friends or family members.\nMediation is cost-effective and time-efficient, reducing the potential for long legal battles and the financial and emotional costs that go with them. In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person\\u2019s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.\nAdditionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial. If you\\u2019re interested in learning more about this resolution process as a way to manage your own conflict or as an advisor if you are working with someone who needs help resolving their dispute, read on.
