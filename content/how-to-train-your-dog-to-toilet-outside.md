## Consistent Training

Just as you wouldn’t expect your dog to understand the meaning of “sit” if you’ve only ever said it once, you can’t expect your dog to know what you mean if you only ever tell them to toilet outside once.
You don’t need to spend hours training your dog, but you do need to be consistent.
Start by picking one area of your garden and telling your dog to toilet there on a regular basis.

If they do their business there, reward them with praise or playtime. If not, calmly take them back to that area and try again.
If your dog starts to go in that one area, gradually expand their toilet territory. Start by letting them use that area and then gradually move them on to using more of your garden.

## A Familiar Environment

Your dog is likely to be more comfortable toileting in a place they are familiar with. This can include their favourite patch of grass, a tree they’ve always used or even the same spot they used when they were a puppy.
If your dog has always used the same area in your garden, try to keep them in that area during the initial toilet training process.
Your dog may be more relaxed and able to concentrate on their business if they are in a place they recognise.
Your dog may also be more relaxed about being in that place if they have always used it in the past.

## Reinforcing Good Behaviour

If your dog is toileting in the wrong places, you need to ensure that you’re not rewarding them for their behaviour.
If your dog is toileting outside, you need to reward that. If they have an accident inside, you need to ignore it and act as if it didn’t happen.
This is particularly important if there are other animals in the house or if there are children who are likely to make a fuss when they see an accident.

If your dog has had accidents inside and has been rewarded for doing so (e.g. because they weren’t noticed), they may have learned that this is a successful way to behave.

## Confining Your Dog When You’re Away

If your dog is used to being let out on a regular basis, you may be able to keep them inside for short periods when you go out. This might help them learn to toilet indoors again as it will force them to go in the indoor toilet.
If your dog is house trained but is used to going out, you can gradually increase the amount of time they stay inside by putting them in a crate when you go out.
If your dog is not used to being confined, you should be careful not to leave them in there for too long as they may attempt to damage the crate.

## Spraying Bitter Spray Or Vinegar Around The Toilet

If there is a particular area of your garden that your dog continues to use, you may want to spray vinegar or bitter spray around that area for a short period to discourage your dog from using it.
This is particularly important if you have a garden that is not fenced off from your neighbours.
As with the other methods in this article, however, you need to make it clear to your dog that you don’t want them to do their business in this area.
You may need to spray the area every day for several days in order to get the message across.

## Conclusion

Dogs are social creatures and often enjoy the company of their humans. If your dog is left alone for long periods, they may start to toilet inside out of boredom or anxiety. If this is the case, you should try to find ways to keep your dog busy while you are away. This can include playing with them or leaving a radio or TV on to provide background noise. You should also make sure your dog has enough toys and places to rest so that they don’t get bored. If you have a dog who has been house trained but is now having accidents inside, it is important to try to find out why.
If your dog is toileting outside, there’s no need to worry. This is the best way to train a dog, and it is something that you should continue to do throughout their life.
