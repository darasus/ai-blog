Assuming you would like a 1000 word article on toilet training your dog: 

Toilet training your dog can be a daunting task, but with a little patience and consistency it can be done! The first thing you need to do is choose an appropriate toilet area for your dog. This should be a spot that is easily accessible for your dog and where you can easily clean up any accidents. Once you have chosen a spot, take your dog there frequently so they can get used to it and start to associate it with going to the toilet. 

When you take your dog to their toilet spot, give them a cue such as “go potty” or “do your business” so they know what you expect of them. Once they start to go, praise them enthusiastically so they know they are doing the right thing. If they have an accident inside, do not punish them as this will only make them more anxious and less likely to want to toilet in the correct spot. Instead, clean up the mess calmly and try again later. 

With patience and consistency, your dog will learn where they are supposed to toilet and you will have a much cleaner house!
