AI-enabled solutions are able to interpret unstructured data, such as what customers are saying about a company online or the sentiment behind brand mentions. Marketers can use this insight to create personalized content, such as advertisements and product recommendations, based on what a specific customer needs.

Every operation we do in our daily lives involves some kind of technology. This can range from how we get to work, to the way we buy and sell goods and services, the sources we use for information and the way we stay in touch with friends and family. Everything has been made easier thanks to technology. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that enables devices or algorithms to act in a human-like manner as observed in humans and animals.\nAI has many practical applications, such as automatically tagging images on social media sites, detecting spam email filters, or self-driving cars. In this blog post, you will learn more about artificial intelligence, its implications on society and potential future implications of AI on jobs and everyday life.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when it\\u2019s fully implemented. While 4G introduced much faster speeds, 5G is 10 times as fast again. This makes it perfect for connecting devices like self-driving cars or virtual assistants like Google Home or Alexa with low latency. The roll-out of 5G is already underway in select markets across the world, but it\\u2019s still early days for this technology.
