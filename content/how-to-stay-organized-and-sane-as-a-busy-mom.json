  "intro": "So you’re a busy mom. It’s challenging and tiring, but also rewarding and exciting. \nIf you’re reading this article, it means you are willing to go the extra mile to make sure things run smoothly as a busy mom. After all, being organized is the key to sanity. \nBeing organized doesn’t mean that everything has to be perfect and in its place all the time; it just means being intentional about keeping things tidy and streamlined so that you have fewer distractions and can get more done in less time. You see, staying organized isn’t about checking off boxes on an organizational checklist for your home or sharing with friends on social media; it’s about streamlining daily routines so that you have more time for what matters most.",
  "content": "## Weekly routines\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at weekly routines that can help keep you on track and organize as a busy mom.\n\n- Make a meal plan: This will help you avoid last-minute takeout, eat healthier, and save money. Simply come up with a plan for 5-6 meals for each week for your family. If you have little ones, this is a great way to introduce healthy eating habits.\n- Clean as you go: Cleaning as you go will ensure that messes don’t become overwhelming and cause you to avoid cleaning altogether. Serving meals, playing with the kids, etc. all leaves behind little messes that are easy to clean while they’re fresh.\n- Find a cleaning buddy: Having a regular cleaning buddy or two can help keep you motivated to get things done.\n- Set a timer: One trick to stay on top of multiple tasks is to set a timer. When one task is done, move on to the next.\n- Build in “Mommy time”: Set aside some time each day for you. It could be 10 minutes with a cup of tea, 30 minutes of meditation, or 30 minutes of reading a good book.\n- Schedule in “Me time” for yourself.\n\n## Checklists for your daily routine\n\nA list of checklists for your daily routine is a great way to stay organized as a busy mom. You can create one for each member of your family, or even just for yourself. Having a checklist for your daily routine will help you to stay on top of things more easily, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting something. If you’re feeling disorganized, a checklist can help you get back on track. You can even print them out and post them somewhere you can easily see them, such as on your fridge or bathroom mirror.\n\nHere are some daily routine checklists you can use.\n\n- Morning routine checklist: Things like getting kids ready for school or extracurricular activities, making lunches, brushing teeth, etc.\n\n- After school routine checklist: Things like cleaning up the house, walking the dog, putting the kids to bed, etc.\n\n- Evening routine checklist: Things like making sure the kids’ homework is done, checking the calendar for the next day, etc.\n\n- Bedtime routine checklist: The last thing you want to do at the end of a long day is to fight with your kids about brushing their teeth or putting on pajamas. Make sure you have a bedtime routine for your kids where all of these things are taken care of well in advance.\n\n## Find time for self-care\n\nBeing a busy mom can be super rewarding, but it can also be stressful and tiring. Planning some time for self-care is important. It doesn’t have to be long or expensive. Sometimes the best self-care is the simplest things. Some ideas include:\n\n- Spending time outside in nature.\n- Meditating or praying.\n- Reading a book or magazine.\n- Talking to a friend.\n- Taking a hot bath or reading in a hot tub.\n- Gardening.\n- Having a hobby.\n\nThe important thing is to carve out some time each week to do something that makes you feel relaxed and happy. It’s easy to get caught up in the daily busyness and stress of being a mom, and if you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t be able to take care of others.\n- Schedule in time for self-care.\n\n## Finding a “shoulder” friend\n\nIf you’re struggling to find time for self-care, or you’re feeling overwhelmed and just don’t know what to do next, find a friend who’s willing to support you and help you get through whatever is going on in your life. This “shoulder” friend could be a family member, another mom, your partner, a close friend, etc.\n\nThe key to successfully using this strategy is to choose someone who is willing to listen without judging you, criticizing you, or trying to “fix” your problems. Someone who is willing to simply listen, ask questions if they don’t understand what you’re going through, and empathize with you.\n\n## Make a chore wheel\n\nA chore wheel is a great way to keep track of chores and avoid arguments about who does what. Simply create a chore wheel with the different chores for your home, and assign each person one or two chores. This can work for kids and adults. There are also chore wheels you can use online, or you can create your own using a dry erase board or poster board.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a visual way of keeping track of chores, not a way of assigning them. You can’t assign a chore to someone because they “owe” you. You could also assign each person a “privilege” or “perk” that they get to pick, like getting the first use of the car on a certain day, having a special dessert once a week, etc.\n\n## Make cleaning a habit\n\nMaking cleaning a habit is a great way to stay organized and not have to stress about keeping a clean house all the time. Choose one cleaning task each week and make it into a regular habit. For example, every Sunday do some sort of cleaning task like sweeping and mopping floors, washing dishes, etc. Once you make it a habit, it will be something you don’t even have to think about. You can also set aside a certain day of the week for certain cleaning tasks. For example, have cleaning day on Saturday, or make Friday “bathroom cleaning day”. This can help keep you from feeling totally overwhelmed.\n\n- Make cleaning a habit: Make cleaning a habit.\n- Declutter regularly: Clutter can make it harder to keep your house clean and organized. Simply decluttering regularly can make a big difference.\n- Keep lists: Keep lists of everything in your home. This makes it easier to keep on top of things, and it’s a good reminder of what needs to be done.\n- Clean as you go: Cleaning as you go is a great way to keep a clean house.\n\n## Don’t be afraid to ask for help\n\nBeing a busy mom can sometimes feel like you need to be superwoman. If you’re feeling overwhelmed and are feeling like you can’t keep up with everything, don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n- Ask for help from your partner.\n- Ask for help from friends or family.\n- Ask for help from a service like Helpling if you need a one-off cleaning done.\n- Ask for help from a neighborhood kid: Sometimes just having someone to talk to and help around the house can make a huge difference in your mood and ability to handle things.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBeing a busy mom can be challenging, but being organized can help you to stay on top of things.\n\nThere are many different ways to stay on top of things as a busy mom, but the most important thing is to be realistic and consistent. You may not be able to get everything done, and that’s okay. What’s most important is that you don’t get overwhelmed and feel like you’re not doing enough."
