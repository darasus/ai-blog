When combined with pressures from outside forces, this unique structure led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe rise and fall of the Soviet Union can be traced back to Vladimir Lenin and his Marxist ideology.

Today, there are only 104 women serving as U.S. representatives and senators, which amounts to 19 percent of all legislators in the Senate and House of Representatives combined. Women also account for just 24 percent of state legislators, 28 percent of city council members, and 15 percent of mayors.\nTo make matters more challenging, this imbalance is not only apparent but also more pronounced in the political sphere than in any other industry. In business management, for example, women hold almost half (44%) of executive roles . But in government? They account for less than one-fifth (19%) of state legislators, city council members, and mayors combined.\nAs a result, when it comes to women in politics we often see a lopsided list that skews toward white cisgender able-bodied wealthy educated privileged women who look very little like the rest of us. And while we\\u2019re happy to see these women rising up as leaders within government \\u2014 they are after all our representatives \\u2014 we can do better\\u2026and we must do better if we want our democracy back from the patriarchy that currently controls it so thoroughly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
