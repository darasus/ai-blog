Both powers were still locked in a nuclear arms race that had begun after World War II and continued for decades. There was no obvious way out of this dangerous rivalry \\u2013 until that October, when Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\nAs a reformer rather than an ideologue like his predecessors, Gorbachev understood that continuing on this path could lead to catastrophe for his country. In December 1985, he traveled to New York City for a summit with U.S. President Ronald Reagan.
