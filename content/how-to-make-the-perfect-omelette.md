## Try a fluffy omelette for breakfast

An omelette served for breakfast is usually made with just eggs and cheese, or with a combination of cheese and ham or bacon. You can use any type or grade of eggs for omelettes; just be sure to use fresh eggs with no cracks. If you like your omelettes fluffy and light, use extra large or jumbo eggs and a minimal amount of butter or oil. But if you prefer a soft, creamy omelette that is easy to cut, use large or medium eggs and add more butter or oil.

If you like your omelette with a crispy edge, make sure to use a non-stick pan. A cast iron pan will produce a crunchy omelette that is easier to cut, but any pan can be used if it is sprayed with oil or butter. For an omelette with a runny centre, cook the eggs until almost done and then put the lid on for a couple of minutes. An omelette cooked in a pan that is too hot will not be fluffy. A lower heat will produce a softer, more tender omelette.

## Use the right pan for your omelette

For a fluffy omelette, choose a non-stick pan, preferably a non-cast iron one. A cast iron pan will produce a crunchy omelette that can be difficult to cut and is not suitable for an omelette with a runny centre. The best pan for an eggy omelette is a heavy-based frying pan. A non-stick pan that is not too heavy will work for both types of omelette.

For a crispy omelette, use a non-stick pan and add some butter or oil. If you want the edges of the omelette to be crispy, use a non-stick pan sprayed with oil or butter. If you want an omelette with a crispy edge and a soft centre, use a non-stick pan sprayed with oil.

## Add your fillings before flipping

If you’re adding fillings to your omelette, such as ham or bell peppers, make sure to add them before you flip the omelette. Once you flip the omelette, add the fillings to the top side. If you’re adding cheese to your omelette, wait until the omelette is almost completely cooked before adding it. If you add cheese early, it will cause the omelette to become too crisp.

## Tips for making a fluffy omelette

- Use the right pan - A non-stick pan is ideal for making an omelette with a fluffy texture. A heavy pan will make the omelette tougher, so only use it if you want a crisp texture.
- Use the right amount of oil or butter - You can use a small amount of butter or oil to make an omelette with a light texture. Use more for a rich, hearty flavour.
- Use the right amount of eggs - The ratio of eggs to butter or oil is about two eggs to one tablespoon of oil or butter.
- Use room-temperature eggs - Start by beating together the eggs and any other ingredients you want in the omelette. Be sure to beat the eggs until they are well combined and room-temperature. This will ensure that they cook evenly.
