summary: A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that protein is
  particularly effective for weight loss when it replaces other carbs in your
  diet, such as bread or pasta. You can boost protein intake by adding a
  protein-rich food to each meal such as nuts and seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy
  products, or lean meat and fish. Whole grains are rich in fiber, which helps
  prevent disease and keeps you feeling full for hours, so you’re less likely to
  overeat. Healthy fats like those found in nuts, seeds, avocado, and fish help
  your body absorb vitamins and promote feelings of fullness.
intro: >-
  People who lose weight and keep it off almost always make healthy eating
  a priority. This may seem obvious, but you might be surprised at how many
  people struggle to keep weight loss goals focused on healthy eating. It’s not
  just about cutting calories; it’s about making sure those calories come from
  nutritious whole foods that boost your metabolism and maintain energy levels.

  Even with the constant bombardment of pro-fad diet messages in the media, most people understand that cutting calories alone is not an effective weight loss strategy. In fact, research shows that for lasting weight loss, dieters need to adopt healthy habits that they can sustain for life—like eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and other low-fat or non-fat sources of nutrients. But even setting this as our goal doesn’t guarantee we’ll achieve it. Here are some tips to help you put healthy eating at the center of your weight loss plan so you get results you can keep forever:

## Start with protein.

Protein helps keep you full and fuels your muscles so they can perform their best. It can also help prevent muscle loss when you’re on a calorie-restricted diet—helping to ensure that the weight you do lose is fat. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that protein is particularly effective for weight loss when it replaces other carbs in your diet, such as bread or pasta.
When it comes to weight loss, most experts recommend getting about one-third of your daily calories from protein. But this can be trickier than it sounds. Many popular protein sources are also high in calories or full of fat.
You can boost protein intake by adding a protein-rich food to each meal, such as nuts and seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy products, or lean meat and fish. And don’t forget about protein-rich foods that are naturally low in fat, such as beans, broccoli, and spinach.

## Set yourself up for success.

When you’re trying to lose weight, your diet is where you’ll have the most success if you focus your efforts. Exercise alone isn’t enough, and cutting calories without attention to the nutritional quality of your food simply doesn’t work.
You may find it easier to keep your healthy eating habits at the front of your mind if you plan your meals in advance. You can also prep healthy snacks for yourself to make sure you don’t find yourself hungry and tempted to reach for an unhealthy convenience food.

## Veggies! Veggies! Veggies!

Vegetables are the original superfood—packed with nutrients that can help you prevent disease and stay slim. If you’re trying to lose weight, one way to make sure you’re getting enough veggies is to fill half your plate with them at each meal.
You can also boost the number of veggies in your diet by choosing fresh vegetables over less nutritious canned or frozen varieties. Broccoli and carrots, for example, are much healthier when fresh, and many other vegetables are more nutritious when eaten without added salt or fat.
Even if you don’t like broccoli and carrots, there are many other healthy options to choose from. And if you’re having trouble getting in the recommended amount of veggies, try eating them in creative ways like stir-fries, salads, soups, or stews.

## Whole grains are your friend.

Whole grains are rich in fiber, which helps prevent disease and keeps you feeling full for hours, so you’re less likely to overeat. Research also shows that people who eat more whole grains tend to be leaner than those who don’t—especially if they replace refined grains with whole grains.
You can choose whole grains at any meal by opting for brown rice, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and other whole-grain foods.
While whole grains are a healthy part of any weight loss diet, you should be careful not to overdo it with high-carb foods in general. Limiting your carb intake to healthy sources like whole grains can help prevent weight gain when you’re trying to lose weight.

## Healthy fats help, too.

Healthy fats—like those found in nuts, seeds, avocado, and fish—help your body absorb vitamins and promote feelings of fullness. Research also suggests that healthy fats like these can actually help you lose weight when you’re eating a low-calorie diet.
You can include healthy fats in every meal by adding nuts, seeds, or avocado to salads; fish to stir-fries or whole-grain dishes; or a spoonful of virgin coconut oil to dishes that don’t require high heat.

## Don’t forget about dessert!

Sure, healthy eating is important for weight loss, but it’s also important for health. And while it’s true that many desserts are fattening, there are plenty of low-calorie desserts you can enjoy when you’re trying to lose weight.
Desserts made with whole grains, low-fat milk, or fruit are usually the healthiest. You can also choose low-calorie desserts made with other ingredients like stevia, artificial sweeteners, non-fat yogurt, or low-fat ice cream.

## Bottom line

Because each person is different, it’s impossible to say how many calories you need to lose weight. If you’re not sure how many calories you should aim for each day, try talking to a doctor or dietitian. Getting your daily calorie needs right is one of the best ways to start losing weight for good. Once you know how many calories you need, you can help keep yourself on track by making sure your diet is rich in nutritious whole foods. Healthy eating is the key to lasting weight loss.
