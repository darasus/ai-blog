Google's monopoly: How the tech giant controls our lives

We all know Google as the world’s largest search engine. But what many of us don’t realize is that the tech giant has a monopoly on our lives. Google controls everything from the way we communicate, to the way we find information, to the way we shop. And it’s only getting bigger and more powerful.

How did Google become so big and so powerful? Well, it all started with search. Google quickly rose to dominance in the early 2000s as the go-to search engine for internet users. And as Google grew, so did its reach and its influence.

Today, Google is much more than just a search engine. It’s a tech giant that controls many aspects of our lives. Let’s take a look at some of the ways Google controls us:

1. Communication

Google owns two of the most popular communication platforms in the world: Gmail and Hangouts. Gmail is the world’s largest email service with over 1 billion users. And Hangouts is a popular messaging app that’s used by millions of people every day.

By controlling these communication platforms, Google has a lot of power over the way we communicate with each other. And it’s not just personal communication that Google controls. The company also owns Google Apps for Business, which is used by millions of businesses around the world for communication and collaboration.

2. Information

Google is also the world’s largest source of information. The company owns popular search engine and research tools like Google Scholar, Google Books, and Google News. And it’s not just text information that Google controls. The company also owns YouTube, the world’s largest video-sharing website.

With all of these information sources under its control, Google has a lot of power over what we learn and how we learn it. The company can shape our understanding of the world in a very real way.

3. Shopping

Google is also a major player in the world of online shopping. The company owns popular shopping platforms like Google Shopping and Google Express. And it’s not just online shopping that Google controls. The company also has a hand in offline shopping through its Android Pay service.

By controlling these shopping platforms, Google has a lot of power over how we spend our money. The company can influence what we buy and how much we spend. And it can even track our spending habits to target us with ads for products and services that we’re more likely to buy.

4. Advertising

Google is one of the world’s largest advertising companies. The company sells ads on its own websites and apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Search. But that’s not all. Google also sells ads on millions of other websites and apps through its AdSense program.

In total, Google sells ads on over 2 million websites and 650,000 apps. That’s a lot of power over the advertising industry. And it’s not just businesses that Google can influence with its ads. The company can also target ads to individuals based on their personal interests and habits.

5. Privacy

Finally, there’s the issue of privacy. As we’ve seen, Google has a lot of information about us. And it uses this information to target ads, sell products, and even influence our behavior. This raises some serious privacy concerns.

Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to protect your privacy from Google. But even if you take all of these steps, you’re still not completely safe from the tech giant’s reach. Google has too much power and too much control over our lives.
