intro: >-
  There’s no denying the impact that technology has on our lives. From
  making communication easier and more accessible to improving productivity in
  the workplace, the advantages of technology are seemingly endless. 

  However, with this increased usage of technology also comes some downsides. In particular, there has been growing concern regarding how big tech companies are using their vast quantities of data to manipulate users for their own gain. These companies are harvesting user information and using it to further their own business interests, often at the expense of user privacy and well-being. 

  These examples of how big tech is harming society will help you see these companies for what they really are: greedy corporations with little regard for consumer welfare other than how it impacts their bottom line.

## Facebook

Facebook has certainly been no stranger to controversy in the past few years. The social media giant has been criticized for allowing the spread of false information on its platform, misinformation that some argue had an impact on the outcome of certain elections. Additionally, it has been accused of having a negative impact on mental health and being used as a platform for bully and hate speech.
Moreover, Facebook has also come under fire for the way it handles user data and privacy. The company has been criticized for using a “take it or leave it” approach when it comes to data collection and not being transparent about its practices. For example, Facebook’s default settings allow for vast amounts of data collection, such as tracking what other websites you visit and what you like or click on.

## Google

Search engines, like Google, are a huge part of our everyday lives. However, few people are aware of the fact that these companies are using your information to create a comprehensive profile of you. Google uses your email address, interests, browsing history, and even your location to create an incredibly detailed profile.
While some of this data is used to provide better search results, the majority of it is used to better target you with advertisements. Indeed, Google makes an immense amount of money off advertisements and has even admitted to letting advertisers directly select what demographic they want to target.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t end there. Google has also been accused of manipulating search results to prioritize its own products over others. A recent report also claims that Google uses its vast data to suppress certain articles and news that it doesn’t want you to see.

## Instagram: Constant surveillance and ad targeting

Instagram has become one of the most popular social media platforms over the past few years, particularly among younger demographics. However, little has been said about the potential hazards of using the platform.
Unfortunately, Instagram has been accused of harvesting user data and using it for surveillance. Indeed, the company has been accused of scanning uploaded images for drugs, guns, and other illegal activities.
While this may seem like a good idea on the surface, it is important to note that users are not notified that their images are being scanned. This means that the company is harvesting user data without consent.
Instagram has also been accused of using user data to target users with advertisements. Indeed, researchers have suggested that Instagram is more focused on collecting data and increasing profit than it is on protecting user privacy.

## Amazon: Data Collection and Lack of Transparency

Amazon is one of the most well-known and popular companies on the planet. While many people are fully aware of what Amazon’s main business is, not everyone is aware of the extent of the company’s data collection. Indeed, Amazon’s data collection methods are quite expansive, including everything from scanning items you look at online to logging your Amazon purchases.
Indeed, Amazon has been accused of using data harvesting for bottomless profiling and leaving very little up to chance. Amazon’s consumer profiles are incredibly detailed, including all the items you’ve ever purchased, when you purchased them, and how much you paid for them.
Moreover, Amazon has also been accused of having a lack of transparency in terms of how it uses user data. In fact, the only information users are privy to is a small, vague paragraph. This notification does not go into detail about what data is being collected or how it is being used.

## Snapchat: Lack of Confidentiality and Full Transparency

Snapchat is another extremely popular social media platform, especially among the younger demographic. However, like the other platforms discussed, it has garnered some criticism regarding its practices.
For example, Snapchat has been accused of harvesting user data and not being transparent about how it is used. Indeed, once again, the only notification users are privy to is a small, vague paragraph in the app itself.
Indeed, unlike other social media companies, Snapchat has even been accused of lacking confidentiality. This means that users have no guarantee that their information will not be accessed or used by third-party companies.
Indeed, it has been suggested that the company is not very serious about privacy, and any assurances it may have given previously can be disregarded.

## Microsoft and Windows 10: Forced Software and Loss of Control

Microsoft has been a staple of the technology world for many years. Indeed, the company is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, and many people use their products on a daily basis. However, Microsoft has been accused of harvesting user data and taking away control from consumers.
Microsoft has come under fire in the past few years for their Windows 10 upgrade. In fact, the company was accused of “forcing” the upgrade on consumers. Indeed, many people believe that Microsoft’s behavior crosses ethical boundaries and goes as far as being downright malicious.
Indeed, in order to upgrade to Windows 10, users must agree to change their default settings to allow automatic updates. This means that the software will update whenever Microsoft decides without the user’s consent.

## Conclusion

As you can see from the above, the dark side of big tech is very real. These companies are using their vast quantities of data to manipulate users for their own gain. In order to protect yourself, it is important to stay aware of the latest developments in the tech world and make informed decisions about what services you use and how you use them.

Big technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are constantly looking for new ways to get your attention and make money. It’s up to us as consumers to recognize when they’re crossing ethical boundaries and make informed decisions about how we use these products.
