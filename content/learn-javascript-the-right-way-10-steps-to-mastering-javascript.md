## Grab a copy of the fundamentals

Before learning how to build anything, you first need to understand how the pieces fit together. To give yourself a solid foundation, we recommend picking up the following introductory resources:

- Website: Learning Javascript: Get Started Today - This online course gives you a great overview of all the basics, including how JS interacts with other languages and how it can be used to create interactive and responsive websites.
- Book: Eloquent JavaScript - If you like reading and prefer more of a book format, you can pick up a copy of Eloquent JavaScript to master the basics of the language. This book is extremely popular among the community and is best for readers who are comfortable with basic programming concepts.
- Book: Modern Javascript: Understanding The Language Of The Web - If you’re looking for a more comprehensive introduction to JavaScript, you can also pick up a copy of Modern Javascript. This book is great for beginners and is especially useful if you’re planning on learning backend development as well.

## Learn how to build websites with HTML and CSS

As we’ve mentioned, code is dynamic and expressive. With JavaScript, you can create interactive and responsive websites, as well as apps. However, before you can do that, you first need to learn how to build websites with HTML and CSS. Both of these languages are used to build websites and are commonly used together.
It’s also important to note that both of these languages are easy to learn. For example, HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, while CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Both are relatively straightforward, which is why they’re great starting points for beginners.

## Learn how to build apps with JavaScript

As mentioned, HTML and CSS are used to build static websites. Once you’ve mastered these skills, you can take your coding skills to the next level by learning how to build apps with JavaScript. When you build apps with JavaScript, you can make them come alive. Apps are interactive and enable users to create, store, and share data.
When you’re learning how to build apps with JavaScript, it’s important to remember that you’re not building a website. Instead, you’re coding for a specific platform, like Android or iOS. In other words, the code you use for apps is different from the code used for websites. You can, however, use the skills you’ve learned from building websites with HTML and CSS to build apps with JavaScript.

## Understand why Javascript is so important for businesses

As we’ve discussed, JavaScript is an incredibly useful and versatile language. But how exactly how is it used within companies? Let’s break it down:

- Increasing Website Engagement: When you have a website, you want to drive traffic and increase engagement as much as possible. With JavaScript, you can create interactive features that encourage users to spend more time on your site.
- Better UX: You can also use JavaScript to design better user experiences. This includes designing more intuitive interfaces and laying out your site in a way that makes it easier to navigate.
- Real-Time Communication: With the rise of chatbots and voice assistants, it’s more important than ever to know how to code with JavaScript. This language is great for building real-time communication features that allow users to create alerts, receive push notifications, and more.

## Get comfortable with ES6 and ES7

As you continue to learn how to code with JavaScript, you’ll start to encounter different versions of the language. To keep up with the latest technology, we recommend staying up to date with the current versions, ES6 and ES7.
Let’s break down what you need to know about each of these versions:

- ES6: ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6 and is the latest version of JavaScript. It includes features like classes, a new way to create asynchronous code, and better syntax for dealing with JavaScript. This version of the language is supported by all major browsers except for Internet Explorer, which means you can use it to build websites and apps.
- ES7: ES7 stands for ECMAScript 7, which is expected to be released in 2020. Although this version of the language isn’t as widely used as ES6, it’s still important to learn the basics. This version of the language includes features like promises, generators, and async/await.

## Join a coding bootcamp to boost your resume

If you’re serious about landing a job at a tech company, you’ll want to make sure your resume is as strong as possible. While you can certainly learn how to code by yourself, there are other ways to improve your skills and boost your resume as well. One example is by joining a coding bootcamp, where you can learn how to code in a team-oriented environment.
This is an immersive learning experience that allows you to foster relationships with other aspiring coders and build your skills in an accelerated fashion. This is an ideal option for beginners who want to learn how to code but aren’t sure where to start.

## Find a platform where you can code regularly

As you learn how to code, you’re going to experience a lot of highs and lows. At times, you’ll feel like you have a good grasp on the language, while other times you’ll feel completely lost. The key to mastering this language is to learn how to code consistently.
To do this, you’ll want to find a platform where you can code regularly. This could be in a classroom setting, online, or even in a meet-up. What’s important is that you set yourself up for success by committing to coding regularly.

## Commit to constantly learning and growing as a coder

Learning how to code is a life-long process. In other words, you don’t become an expert coder after you’ve learned the basics. This is an ever-evolving field that requires you to constantly learn and grow.
This means you should always be looking for new ways to improve your skills. For example, you could read blogs or articles from other coders, join a coding community, or even participate in online coding challenges. The more you learn about this language, the better you’ll be at it.

## Conclusion

Learning how to code is a challenging but incredibly rewarding process. It’s an incredibly in-demand skill that’s beneficial for all industries. With that in mind, this guide provides a helpful step-by-step guide for those who are interested in learning this skill. If you follow the tips and tricks outlined in this article, you’ll be well on your way to mastering this language.
