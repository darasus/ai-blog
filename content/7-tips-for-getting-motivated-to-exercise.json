However, there are ways to make your food dollars go further and still eat well.\nInstead of making weekly trips to multiple stores and markets, plan a shopping day and hit one store at a time. Look for sales in that store before you go and stock up on foods that are good value. You might even consider investing in a membership card or becoming an insider or club member so you get vouchers or other discounts. Adding your own spin on some classic cheap meals will also help you save money without sacrificing nutrition.

If you work in an office, it\\u2019s highly likely that your building has its own kitchen where a catered lunch service prepares hot lunches for staff every day. Similarly, if you go to school, there will most likely be a canteen serving the same type of unhealthy food as an adult educational institution.The good news is that even if you are stuck eating these foods on a daily basis, you can make your kitchen a healthier place by altering what goes into the meals you cook at home and the ones that you buy.
