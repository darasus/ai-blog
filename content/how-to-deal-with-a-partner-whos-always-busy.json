If you\\u2019re eligible to mediate, that might depend on the type of case you have and who you are. For example, there may be other requirements that you meet to qualify as an eligible candidate.\nMediation eligibility can differ depending on whether the dispute resolution program requires participants to be from a certain income level or has other prerequisites such as being a homeowner or having a specific legal status. You should also keep in mind that some programs may require mediation only when parties can\\u2019t agree on a settlement and not necessarily as an initial step in their process for resolving disputes.
