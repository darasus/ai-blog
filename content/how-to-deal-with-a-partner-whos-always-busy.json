It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Chief among them are reduced stress, greater trust, increased collaboration, and improved performance. Negotiating can be stressful and lead to strained relationships if one party feels like the other isn\\u2019t being fair or trustworthy.\nMediation helps resolve these issues in a constructive way by establishing a safe space where people can fully understand each other\\u2019s perspectives. Trust increases when people feel like they won\\u2019t be attacked or criticized for their ideas. Collaboration improves as everyone works together towards a common goal instead of against each other. And performance increases because people are more comfortable bringing up any problems so they can be fixed sooner rather than later - leading to better company growth and development.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
