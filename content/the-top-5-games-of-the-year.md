The humans have been reduced to tribal civilizations living in primitive conditions, while the machines have developed intelligence and are now waging a war against them. Horizon Zero Dawn follows Aloy, a young outcast of a tribal society, who discovers that she’s connected to the machines and is able to destroy them with special arrows.
