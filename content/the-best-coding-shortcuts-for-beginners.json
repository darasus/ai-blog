Top companies like Google, Dropbox, Netflix, Uber, and many others are adopting Go for their backend services\\u2014and not just because of its unusual mascot character.\nGo\\u2019s simplicity makes it easier to read and understand code. Its standard libraries mean programmers don\\u2019t need to create common functions from scratch every time they write a program. Its built-in concurrency enables fast performance for programs that make multiple simultaneous requests. And its support for interfaces means you can build flexible software without worrying about what kind of data your code expects.\nThere is no denying that there are a lot of benefits from using Go for developing web applications .
