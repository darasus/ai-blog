If your thoughts immediately went to the idea of parent and child classes, then you\\u2019ve either studied object-oriented programming or you understand the nuances of English. However, if you think about a parent giving birth to a child, then you obviously haven\\u2019t studied enough OOP. Let\\u2019s see what inheritance in Java is all about and why it\\u2019s useful.\nWe often find ourselves reusing code that has been implemented in some other class. This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another. This is called inheritance in Java. It is one of the cornerstones of OOP programming and something that every serious programmer should know well.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

A big reason for this is that software designers are paying more attention to users\\u2019 experience. Instead of spending hours on making designs, they are investing more time on designing user experiences. User interfaces play a vital role in how an application is perceived by its target audience.\nA user interface consists of the various screens or windows that provide access to information, or enable actions such as viewing, creating, saving, and opening files. A user interface also includes the visual properties (such as colors, fonts, and graphics) and navigational components (such as menus, buttons, and tabs) that users see and interact with when using a computer program.\nIn this blog post we will learn about JavaServer Faces; what it is; why you might use it; and finally a brief introduction to its key concepts.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
