Mediation does not impose a solution on the parties; the parties must agree to the terms of any settlement. The parties' attorneys can be present, but they don't participate in the mediation itself. The mediation process begins with an assessment by the mediator to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s position. The mediator uses various mediation tools and techniques to facilitate communication between the parties. Mediation is collaborative, flexible, and can be modified to accommodate the parties’ schedules.",

It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have.
