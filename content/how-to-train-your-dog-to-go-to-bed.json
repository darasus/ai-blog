From concerns over online safety to the amount of time kids spend looking at screens, digital parenting presents its own unique set of challenges.\nAs technology continues to advance, so do the ways in which our kids can interact with it. From tablets and smart TVs to smartphones and video games, it seems as though there are more screens than ever before. This is especially true for younger children who have grown up with these devices as a normal part of their everyday life.\nThe pros and cons of screen time for kids can be debated endlessly but at the end of the day, your child will likely spend a lot of their time consuming some form of media in one way or another. As their parent, it\\u2019s important that you understand the benefits and risks associated with screen time so that you can make informed decisions about how much exposure they receive on a regular basis.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.\nMediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there\\u2019s no clear right or wrong side or when it\\u2019s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
