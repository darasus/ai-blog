  "summary": "When a dog is overtired, their body produces an excess of cortisol, a hormone that tells the body to shut down and prepare for rest. High levels of cortisol can take a serious toll on the health of your dog. A dog whoâ€™s consistently overtired can even develop depression, which is a serious health problem in and of itself. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog, and a healthy dose of exercise can help tire them out both physically and mentally so they can sleep better at night.",

It\\u2019s great that they want to explore the world around them and make new discoveries every day, but what isn\\u2019t so great is when they keep you up at night with their shenanigans. Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company. Fortunately, training your dog to go to bed is fairly easy with some dedication from you!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
