## How does our diet affect the environment?

You might wonder why we’re talking about the environment when discussing dietary choices. But the fact is that our diet has a huge impact on the environment. When we eat, we consume resources that are needed to grow our food: soil, water, energy. Food production also generates waste, which can be harmful to the natural environment.
A healthy and sustainable diet is one that balances the amount of resources it uses with the nutrients it provides. A diet that provides too many calories but not enough nutrients is unsustainable. An unbalanced or unhealthful diet has too much of one or more nutrients.
A disproportionate amount of calories and nutrients can have a significant environmental impact.

## Producing food has an environmental impact

The growing demand for food has led to increased production of crops and livestock. This causes environmental damage through deforestation, water consumption, and soil erosion.
A person who eats an average of 2,000 calories per day will consume about 7,100 pounds of food each year. To grow that much food, we need to use more than 10,000 gallons of water, about 5,000 sq. ft. of land, and generate about 2,600 pounds of carbon dioxide.

## Overfishing and loss of biodiversity

Livestock production uses the majority of our agricultural land, freshwater, and energy. Reducing the amount of meat in our diet could help reduce the amount of resources used for agriculture, which could help reduce the amount of fish being harvested.
When people eat more fish, they are consuming the eggs and larvae of marine organisms. Since wild fish populations are already declining due to overfishing, aquaculture is being used to meet the growing demand for fish. But aquaculture uses significant amounts of resources — especially in terms of water and feed.

## Desertification and deforestation

Agriculture accounts for about 60% of global deforestation. It has reduced the amount of forested land by about half since the start of the industrial revolution. Forests provide us with many important goods and services such as clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, and carbon storage.
A healthy and sustainable diet is one that balances the amount of resources it uses with the nutrients it provides. A diet that provides too many calories but not enough nutrients is unsustainable. An unbalanced or unhealthful diet has too much of one or more nutrients.
A disproportionate amount of calories and nutrients can have a significant environmental impact, such as deforestation and soil erosion.

## Methane emissions from livestock

Livestock — especially cattle — produce methane, which is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The feed and animal production needed to raise livestock require significant amounts of resources such as pasture and water.
The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by livestock is controversial. But these figures show that growing feed for livestock is a major source of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

## Conclusion

The modern diet has an important impact on the environment. Eating less meat and more vegetables could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by up to two thirds and also reduce the amount of resources used for agriculture. Eating more local, seasonal foods could reduce food transportation and consequent carbon emissions, water use, and biodiversity loss due to monoculture. And eating more plant proteins instead of animal proteins could reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture.

Our food choices have the potential to help or harm the environment, depending on the choices we make. By making a few simple tweaks to our diets, we can reduce our carbon footprint and make a positive difference.
