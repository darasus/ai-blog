## What is Organic Food?

Organic food is any food produced using organic agriculture practices that focus on ecological cycles and biodiversity. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics, and certain kinds of preservatives.
Organic foods are also not processed using irradiation or modified industrial solvents. It is both an agricultural movement and a form of self-regulating marketing.

As a general rule, the fewer ingredients a food contains, the fewer potential problems there are with it. So, look for foods that are as close to their natural state as possible, and make sure to keep an eye on the ingredients lists.

## The Environmental Impact of Producing Meat

The production of meat has a serious and significant impact on the environment. The carbon footprint of meat is large, due to the methane released from livestock and the amount of water and feed needed to grow livestock feed.
The impact of meat production is worsened by modern methods, such as the use of synthetic fertilizer, mechanized irrigation, and the application of synthetic pesticides.
The environmental impact of meat is significant, both in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and in the amount of freshwater consumed.

## The Environmental Impact of Producing Dairy and Eggs

The environmental impact of producing dairy and eggs is significant, with the greenhouse gas emissions of the dairy industry being 17 times higher than that of vegetables, and the carbon footprint of eggs being five times greater than that of vegetables.
The environmental impact of dairy and eggs production is worsened by modern methods, such as the use of synthetic fertilizer, mechanized irrigation, and the application of synthetic pesticides.

## The Environmental Impact of Beans and Grains

The environmental impact of producing legumes and grains is very low, with the legume carbon footprint being a third of that of vegetables, and the grain carbon footprint being half that of vegetables.
The environmental impact of beans and grains production is worsened by modern methods, such as the use of synthetic fertilizer, mechanized irrigation, and the application of synthetic pesticides.

## The Environmental Impact of Seafood

The environmental impact of producing seafood is significant, with the carbon footprint of seafood being two times greater than that of vegetables, and the protein-to-fish ratio being 5:1.
The environmental impact of seafood production is worsened by modern methods, such as the use of synthetic fertilizer, mechanized irrigation, and the application of synthetic pesticides.
