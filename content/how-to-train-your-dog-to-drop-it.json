Heck, most dogs will go their entire lives without ever picking something up and then purposefully putting it somewhere else.\nIf you want to train your dog to drop something on command, you\\u2019ll need to focus a bit on simple tricks like that. After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Start by feeding your dog their normal food while they\\u2019re in a sitting position. Then, once they\\u2019re done eating, ask them to drop the food from their mouth on a drop cloth. You can even use a clicker to help you mark the exact moment your dog drops their food.\nOnce your dog is comfortable dropping food from their mouth, you can start to feed them treats and wait for them to drop them from their mouth on a drop cloth. The process might take a bit longer with treats, but it will help you to avoid a mess in the short term.\nOnce your dog is comfortable dropping food and treats from their mouth, they\\u2019re ready to move on to something a bit more interesting.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Step 3: Once your dog is comfortable, switch to using a clicker\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`While you can use both treats and a clicker to help train your dog to drop things, they work in very different ways.

You can either do this as soon as it leaves their mouth or wait for it to hit the drop cloth.\nOnce you\\u2019ve begun to click when your dog drops things, you can start to ignore them for a moment. Then, once they\\u2019ve realized that nothing is happening after dropping the item, you can begin rewarding them again.\nOnce your dog is comfortable with the clicker, you can start to mix things up a bit.

For example, you can reward them when they drop the item and when they leave it alone after dropping it.\nOnce you\\u2019ve gotten to this point, you can begin to mix things up a bit. This can start by rewarding your dog for dropping things from close by and then walking away.

Then, you\\u2019ll want to start rewarding them for dropping things on cue regardless of where they are in relation to you.\nOnce you\\u2019ve gotten to this point, you can start to mix things up a bit.
