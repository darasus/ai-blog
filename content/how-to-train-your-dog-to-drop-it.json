For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life.

The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.\nMediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there\\u2019s no clear right or wrong side or when it\\u2019s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
