Understanding these variations is crucial to picking the right mediation process for your specific needs.\nMediation can be broadly divided into two categories: third-party mediation, where an impartial mediator helps parties reach agreement; and collaborative or problem-solving mediation, where the mediator acts as a guide who helps both parties negotiate in good faith and move towards a mutually beneficial solution.\nEach type of mediation has its own set of rules and requirements.
