If you feel like you have a clear idea of the end goal, it\\u2019ll be easier to stay focused on your path to achieving it. When it comes to exercise, there are many different types of goals you can set for yourself. For example, you could set a goal to complete a certain number of workouts every week, or you could aim to lift a certain amount of weight by a certain time. It\\u2019s also important to set short-term goals that have smaller milestones within them. This will help you to stay focused, and ensure that you don\\u2019t get overwhelmed with trying to think too far ahead.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mix up your workouts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019ve been doing the same workout routine for years, it\\u2019s time to mix things up.

But if you change up the type of workouts you\\u2019re doing, you\\u2019ll have a much easier time staying committed to your fitness goals. The trick here is not to completely overhaul your workouts, but to simply add a new element to your existing routine. For example, you could try incorporating a new type of cardio into your week, or add some weights to your yoga practice. Another way to mix up your workouts is to try new fitness classes or hiring a personal trainer to help you design a custom routine that suits your goals and fitness level.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Find an exercise you love\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some people thrive off having a strict workout schedule, but others find this overwhelming and unhelpful.

This doesn\\u2019t mean you have to quit your regular workout and go for something completely outlandish, but there are lots of different ways to add variety to your routine. For example, if you love swimming, but hate running, try mixing in a few sprints into your week to switch things up. Or if yoga is your thing, try adding in some strength training in the form of Pilates or barre classes.

No matter how small they may seem to you, they are still important steps towards your overall goals. Try keeping a workout journal to help you stay organized and focused. Journaling has been shown to improve focus and productivity, as well as reduce anxiety.
