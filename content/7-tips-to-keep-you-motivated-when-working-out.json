When it comes to exercise, there are many different types of goals you can set for yourself. For example, you could set a goal to complete a certain number of workouts every week, or you could aim to lift a certain amount of weight by a certain time.

The trick here is not to completely overhaul your workouts, but to simply add a new element to your existing routine.

For example, if you love swimming, but hate running, try mixing in a few sprints into your week to switch things up.

Instead, we\\u2019re often forced to make snap decisions about what we can eat quickly and conveniently. Unfortunately, those decisions too often lead to less than healthy snack options like potato chips or sweets. However, there are plenty of great ways to get your recommended daily intake of fruits and veggies even when you\\u2019re on the go. These 30 healthy snacks for on-the-go are perfect for keeping in your purse, desk drawer, locker, or anywhere else you might find yourself hungry and without access to a full meal.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
