When it comes to exercise, there are many different types of goals you can set for yourself. For example, you could set a goal to complete a certain number of workouts every week, or you could aim to lift a certain amount of weight by a certain time. It\\u2019s also important to set short-term goals that have smaller milestones within them.

But if you change up the type of workouts you\\u2019re doing, you\\u2019ll have a much easier time staying committed to your fitness goals. The trick here is not to completely overhaul your workouts, but to simply add a new element to your existing routine. For example, you could try incorporating a new type of cardio into your week, or add some weights to your yoga practice.

For example, if you love swimming, but hate running, try mixing in a few sprints into your week to switch things up.

No matter how small they may seem to you, they are still important steps towards your overall goals. Try keeping a workout journal to help you stay organized and focused.
