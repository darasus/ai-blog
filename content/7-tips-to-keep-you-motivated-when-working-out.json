When it comes to exercise, there are many different types of goals you can set for yourself. For example, you could set a goal to complete a certain number of workouts every week, or you could aim to lift a certain amount of weight by a certain time.

The trick here is not to completely overhaul your workouts, but to simply add a new element to your existing routine.
