## You Control Your Learning

Learning with a teacher or an instructor is a two-way process in which both parties are equally responsible. You can ask your instructor questions and clarify certain concepts, and they can provide you with feedback. But typically, they are the ones steering the ship. With self-learning, you call the shots. You decide how much time you want to spend on each subject and which books or online courses you read. You also have the final say on how much effort you put into each topic. You can go as fast or as slow as you like, as often as you like and on subjects that really interest you.
You can also tailor your learning to your own interests and goals. If you want to understand a particular concept or skill better, you can research it as many times as you like and from many different perspectives. You can also choose to learn to your strengths or weaknesses. If you have an area of interest, you can focus on reading the best books on the subject, watching the best lectures, and practicing the best exercises. If you are struggling with an aspect of your life or career, you can focus on improving those skills with additional practice.

## You Can Learn Whatever You Want

With self-learning, you can study whatever you want. You are not limited to curriculums, textbooks or timetables. You can choose to study topics that you are passionate about or that are relevant to your work. You can also focus on specific skills you want to acquire or areas where you feel you need improvement. You can even combine these topics and skills to create your own learning plan. Best of all, you can choose the learning sources you want to use. You can read books, watch online videos, listen to podcasts and audio lectures, or do a combination of these. You can even create your own learning materials if you have enough expertise in the subject. Learning whatever you want is one of the biggest advantages of self-learning. There are no textbooks that you have to buy, no lectures you have to attend, and no deadlines to meet. You can decide when to start studying, how fast to proceed, and how long your learning sessions should last.

## Self-Learning Is Cheaper Than Traditional Learning

Traditional learning is expensive. It costs money to go to school and even more to attend a university. It also costs money to join clubs, sports and other extracurricular activities. On the other hand, self-learning is free. You can learn online, at the library or in your own home. You don’t even have to purchase books if you can get them from your local library. Even if you do buy books, they are a lot cheaper than traditional learning expenses. Many textbooks are very expensive, but there are many free e-books available. You can also find several free online courses and podcasts about almost any subject.

## Self-Learning Means No Waiting For Classes To Begin Or End

With traditional learning methods, you have to wait for the school year to begin and end before you can start or finish a course. You also have to wait until the school year starts before you can join extracurricular activities. With self-learning, you don’t have to wait for these events. You can start studying what interests you right away or at any time during the year. You can also study at any time of the day or night. No matter how busy you are with your job, family, or extracurricular activities, you still have time to study because learning is a skill that you can do anywhere.

## Self-Learning Helps You Build Confidence And Improve Problem-Solving Skills

When you learn on your own, you have to figure out what you don’t understand and solve the problems you encounter. You have no one to turn to for help or advice. You have to figure it out for yourself. This can be frustrating and overwhelming at first, but once you overcome these obstacles, you build confidence in your abilities. You also develop problem-solving skills that you can use in other areas of your life. As you continue to learn new things, you have to solve new problems. This means you are always growing and improving. You can apply the same problem-solving skills you developed to overcome your fears or anxieties.

## Self-Learning Strengthens Your Brain

When you learn new things, you create new neural pathways in your brain. In fact, learning can even make your brain larger. These neural pathways help you remember new concepts and apply your new skills. The more often you apply your skills, the stronger they become. But the only way to make these skills stronger is to practice them. You can’t read a book or watch a video about how to ride a bike and expect to be able to ride it. You have to put in the time and effort to actually practice on your bike. The same is true for other skills, such as reading a book about how to speak in public. You have to actually practice your public speaking skills in order to make them stronger.

## Conclusion

Learning is a lifelong process, and it is important to find a learning style that works best for you. Self-learning is a great option for people who are motivated, independent and self-directed. However, it is important to note that not everyone learns best by themselves, and that is okay. There is nothing wrong with taking classes from an instructor or joining a club. There is also nothing wrong with combining both methods either. It is all about finding what works best for you.
