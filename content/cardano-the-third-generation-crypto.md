intro: >-
  Cardano is a new decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency
  project. It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano
  Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an
  earlier version of the blockchain code named “C Haskell” and later changed to
  “Cardano”. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading
  scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .

  The first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.

  Furthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone. 

  This is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.

## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project featuring a new proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Cardano is an open source project, with some parts licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and other parts under the Cardano Settlement Fund license. The Cardano project and development of its software began in 2015 with a series of academic papers written by two scientists and engineers who were also co-founders of the project: Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. The third co-founder and CEO was also involved but worked from Switzerland.

## Who Created Cardano?

Charles Hoskinson is the CEO of IOHK, the engineering company contracted to work on the design and implementation of Cardano. He is also one of the founders of Ethereum and served as its co-founder and CEO. Jeremy Wood is the Chief Strategy Officer of IOHK. He has a background working in healthcare IT.

## History of Cardano

On October 19, 2015, Hoskinson’s company IOHK, which specializes in engineering, research and design of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, entered into a contract to design, engineer and build the Cardano blockchain.
The Swiss company behind Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, oversees investment and business development.
The Third Generation Human Friendly Smart Contract Blockchain with the first ever provably secure protocol. The first two generations are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Cardano Architecture

As noted above, Cardano is a third-generation cryptocurrency project and as such it is built with two layers. The first layer is the Settlement Layer (SL) which is the same for all cryptocurrencies. 
The second layer is the Computational Layer (CL) where different blockchains can be built on top of the SL.
The Cardano SL is an accounting ledger or blockchain with the same functionality as the Bitcoin blockchain.
The CL is where Cardano’s novel “IOHK Blockchain” technology is used. This layer is where the decentralized applications or smart contracts are executed.

## What Problems Does Cardano Seek to Solve?

These are a few of the challenges faced by the first and second generation cryptocurrencies that Cardano aims to solve.

- Scalability - How to speed up transaction verification to enable a larger number of transactions per second.
- Interoperability - How to connect different blockchains as well as various applications (dApps) built on different blockchain protocols.
- Regulation - How to comply with various regulatory policies and regulations as well as audit standards.
- Standardization - How to create a large and inclusive community to bring together different stakeholders.

## How Does Cardano Achieve These Goals?

- Proof of Stake - The Cardano blockchain uses an innovative proof-of-stake consensus protocol called Ouroboros. This algorithm was developed by a scientist and cryptographer named Prof. Aggelos Kiayias of the University of California, Berkeley. The Ouroboros protocol reduces the risk of centralization as it allows for both miners (PoW) and transaction verifiers (PoS) to be on a single network.
- Scalability - Achieving scalability is crucial for blockchain technology to go mainstream. Cardano’s settlement layer uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm where token holders elect delegates to verify transactions and receive rewards. The computational layer uses an innovative proof-of-st-work algorithm called “IOHK- Blockchain”, a consensus protocol employed by the Cardano SL.
- Interoperability - Cardano has an open source software and uses a decentralized governance model to encourage interoperability.
- Regulation - Cardano has a self-funded independent organization called The Cardano Foundation to act as a standards body and be the “voice of Cardano”.
- Standardization - Cardano has an open source software, a decentralized governance model, and Cardano Foundation as a standards body.

## How to Buy and Store Ada?

The first step is to set up a wallet to store your ADA tokens. This can be done in the following ways:
- Google Authenticator - This is the most secure wallet.
- Ledger Nano - This is a hardware wallet that protects your crypto tokens from computer and internet viruses.
- Trezor - This is a hardware wallet that protects your crypto tokens from computer viruses.
- Coinbase - This is the easiest wallet to set up.
- Once you have your wallet set up, you can buy ADA tokens by visiting a crypto exchange such as Bittrex, Binance, or Kraken.

## Bottom Line: Is Cardano Worth Watching Going Forward?

Cardano is the first blockchain project to use a scientific philosophy and a research-first approach to build a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency. That alone makes it worth watching as it could potentially become the industry standard. The team behind this project is made up of some of the best minds in the crypto and scientific research fields. They have also secured some significant partnerships and this project has also been covered extensively by the media. 

With a strong mission to become a third generation blockchain platform and solve the scalability issue faced by existing cryptocurrencies, Cardano is sure to be one to watch in the future.
