Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.

Salmon is also one of the best food sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are also known as polyunsaturated fats. Our bodies need a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fats to help regulate cellular health. But many Western diets have an unbalanced ratio of these fats, with too few omega-3s and too many omega-6s. This can increase your risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Getting more omega-3s and less omega-6s can help improve your health.

It\\u2019s used to catalyse the fermentation process when baking sourdough bread, giving it a distinct sour flavour. Traditionally, starter takes weeks to make, but there are much faster methods using packaged yeast \\u2013 see below. However you choose to make your own starter, the process is relatively straightforward and once you get the hang of it, an easy routine to keep up.\nSourdough has numerous benefits over other kinds of bread. It is easier for your body to digest than white bread because it doesn\\u2019t have any gluten in it (gluten can be challenging for people with a sensitivity or intolerance). Sourdough doesn\\u2019t have any added sugars either; just natural sugars from the fermentation process. It also has more protein than standard breads, which means it keeps you feeling fuller for longer.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
