Eating fruits and veggies can help you meet your daily needs for vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. They also provide antioxidants (which may reduce your risk of disease) and other phytonutrients (which may have additional health benefits).\nVegetables are an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals\\u2014especially vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, potassium, and iron. In addition to being an excellent source of vitamins A and K as well as several B vitamins, fruits are also a great source of fiber.\nIn general the best time to eat seasonal fruits is during their peak season.
