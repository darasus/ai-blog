  "summary": "Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. Salmon is also a good source of the amino acid tryptophan, which helps regulate serotonin levels in the brain. Salmon can be eaten as part of a salad, sandwich, or in a small serving of other fish. When choosing salmon, look for wild salmon that has less than 10% of the daily recommended amount of saturated fat per serving. A healthy diet rich in calcium can help you maintain strong bones and lower your risk of osteoporosis and fractures.",

If so, you\\u2019re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. However, not all types of fish have the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of your diet.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Salmon is also one of the best food sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are also known as polyunsaturated fats. Our bodies need a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fats to help regulate cellular health. But many Western diets have an unbalanced ratio of these fats, with too few omega-3s and too many omega-6s. This can increase your risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Getting more omega-3s and less omega-6s can help improve your health.
