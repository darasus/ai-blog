Mediation is a process that can help you resolve disputes with another person or party. It is an informal and confidential way to resolve disagreements without going to court. Mediation is often used in divorce cases, but it can be used in other types of disputes such as neighbor disputes, contract disputes, and family disputes.

Mediation can help you save time and money, and it can be less stressful than going to court. Mediation is also confidential, which means that what you say during mediation cannot be used against you in court.

If you are considering mediation, you should know that it is not right for every situation. You should also be aware that mediation may not be able to resolve all of the issues in your case. However, mediation can be a helpful tool in many situations.

If you are considering mediation, you should talk to an attorney to find out if it is right for your situation.
