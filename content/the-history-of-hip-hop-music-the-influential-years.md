## The Beginnings of Hip Hop

Hip hop as a music genre can trace its origins to the 1970s, when DJs in New York would mix together different records to create unique rhythmic sounds. DJs like Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa hosted parties where they would play blends of soul, funk, and R&B records, creating a completely new sound that had never been heard before. This music, combined with the physical energy and movement of breakdancing, started to evolve into what we know as “hip hop” today.

Hip hop can also be traced back to Jamaican music culture, specifically the “toasting” style of DJing that emerged in the 1960s. Toasting was a style of rhythmic talking that DJs would do over record tracks, which influenced the style of rapping that DJs like Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa would begin doing on the microphone over music. Although the term “hip hop” was not coined until the early 1980s, the music’s origins go as far back as the breakdancing and DJing culture of the 1970s.

## Early Hip Hop in the 1980s

The 1980s marked the start of the hip-hop movement as we know it today. Breakdancing and DJing culture grew in New York City over the course of the decade, and by the end of the 80s, the first hip-hop records had been released. Pioneering artists like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-D.M.C., and the Beastie Boys were creating new musical styles, fusing together various influences to create a new sound we had never heard before.

Rap music, which was a huge part of the hip-hop movement, rose to popularity as a result of new radio stations such as WBLK and WHBI that played a lot of breakdancing and rap music. These stations were looked down upon by many at the time, but their popularity helped to grow the hip-hop movement and create a strong base for the genre.

## Hip Hop Goes Mainstream

The early-to-mid 1990s marked the point when hip-hop music became a mainstream hit. This is when artists like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were releasing the first records in a new style called “G-funk.” It was a sub-genre of hip-hop that fused together soul, funk, and R&B influences with a more relaxed, slower sound. This type of music became one of the most popular styles of hip-hop at the time, with artists like Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG (who famously rapped about their rivalry with each other) becoming worldwide sensations.

Many credit this point in history with the hip-hop genre’s ascent to the top of the charts. By this time, artists like Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson were beginning to collaborate with hip-hop artists. The show “MTV Unplugged” saw a rise in popularity as MTV began airing hip-hop and R&B music videos non-stop.

## The “Golden Age” of Hip Hop

The “golden age” of hip-hop is an arguable point in history, with some suggesting it is the 1990s, and others claiming the 2000s. It is generally agreed that these were the decades that saw the most commercial success in the genre and the most critically acclaimed artists.

The gold rush of hip-hop continued through the 1990s, but the genre began to diversify and expand into different sub-genres. Alternative rap, heavy metal, and grunge music were all starting to pop up, and by the late 1990s, hip-hop was evolving into a more sophisticated style. The emergence of artists like The Notorious B.I.G., Jay Z, and Nas, as well as the rise of the “gangsta rap” movement, solidified hip-hop’s prominence as an influential genre.

## The “Golden Age” of Hip Hop

Hip hop continued to thrive over the 2000s and 2010s, with artists like Eminem, The Black Eyed Peas, and Kendrick Lamar creating new sub-genres and evolving the genre in new directions. The internet era also saw a huge surge in the popularity of mixtapes, which are free or low-cost albums released by DJs and hip-hop artists that feature a mix of music and rapping. This allowed many DJs and artists to gain a wider audience and become increasingly popular.

The 2000s also saw a rise in the popularity of “pop rap,” as artists like 50 Cent, G-Eazy, and Drake made their mark on the charts. The 2010s have seen an increase in the popularity of music streaming platforms like Spotify and SoundCloud, which have helped hip-hop artists break records and achieve massive success on an international level.

## The “Golden Age” of Hip Hop

Hip hop has come a long way since its humble beginnings in New York City. It has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that has transformed the world and created a universal language among people from all walks of life. Despite the rise of other genres and changing trends in music, hip hop has remained one of the most popular genres worldwide, and there is no sign of it slowing down.

## Late 90s to Early 2000s: The Dark Ages

As we wrap up the “golden age” of hip-hop, we arrive at the “dark ages,” when the genre fell into a slump in terms of commercial success and critical acclaim. This period of time saw the rise of pop-rap artists like Nelly, Ludacris, and Outkast, but also saw a drop in the popularity of hip-hop as a whole.

While there were still some great artists producing music during this time (Eminem, Jay Z, and The Roots, to name a few), the overall quality of hip-hop music seemed to drop off, and it began to receive a lot of criticism and backlash from critics and artists.

## Rebirth and Renaissance

It would seem that hip-hop music had reached its end when the 2000s came to a close. The genre seemed to have run out of new ideas and direction, and people were tired of the same old sounds. Hip hop artists like Drake, Kanye West, and Childish Gambino have certainly breathed new life into the genre, with critics claiming we are currently in a “renaissance” period for hip-hop music.

These artists have experimented with new styles and genres, creating a new sound that can be heard all over the radio. Many of these artists are also creating and producing music videos that are visually stunning and exploring new forms of artistic expression.

## Conclusion

The history of hip hop is a beautiful story of artistic expression and cultural evolution. From its humble beginnings as an underground movement in New York, the genre has grown into a worldwide sensation, with local scenes spawning in cities across the globe.

Hip hop music has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the 1970s and 1980s, but it has evolved into a cultural phenomenon that has transformed the world and created a universal language among people from all walks of life.
