Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\".

Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
