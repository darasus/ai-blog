Its most important products are search, which accounts for around 80% of the company\\u2019s revenue, and YouTube, which has become the world\\u2019s most popular video hosting platform. Google\\u2019s core business model is based on collecting data about users and using it for targeted advertising. Google has built an incredibly successful advertising business by taking advantage of the data it collects about users: it knows which websites users visit, what they like and dislike, what they want to buy, etc. Google uses this data to place relevant ads on its own platforms or on other websites that are part of its advertising networks. Google is also the world\\u2019s leading artificial intelligence company: Its AI research is what produces the data-driven machine-learning algorithms that power Google\\u2019s products.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Amazon\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Amazon has built one of the world\\u2019s most successful e-commerce businesses. It started out as an online bookstore, but today it is a full-service online retailer: customers can buy virtually anything on Amazon and have it delivered to their door the next day. Amazon\\u2019s core business model is based on economies of scale: the company uses its massive customer base and the data it collects about their purchasing patterns to offer lower prices than its offline competitors. Amazon has built two highly profitable business lines: its online retail business and its cloud computing services. The online retail business may be Amazon\\u2019s most profitable business line, but it\\u2019s also extremely capital-intensive: the company needs to buy or lease large quantities of warehouses, hire hundreds of thousands of workers to staff them and invest in new technologies to make the ordering process more efficient.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Facebook\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Facebook started out as a social network for university students, but it has since expanded to become the most popular social network in the world. Its core business model is based on collecting and analyzing user data: Facebook uses the data it collects about its users to sell targeted advertising. It also uses the data it collects about its users for \\u201Cdata mining\\u201D: i.e., using it to discover new business opportunities. For example, Facebook has built a powerful artificial intelligence initiative called \\u201CAI Research\\u201D that publishes academic papers on new AI-powered methods.

Apple\\u2019s hardware empire started with the iPod music player, which was a hit product that also helped to fuel the rise of online music streaming. Today, Apple continues to enjoy strong demand for its hardware products: its latest iPhone model was released in October 2018 and sold over 50 million units in the first three months.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The rise of digital platforms and the role of data\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Internet companies have always collected and processed large amounts of user data.

There are many types of digital platforms, but the big four are the ones that have grown to become multi-billion-dollar companies. They are all technology companies that use data to make their products more efficient and appealing. They are also all data companies whose core business is to sell user data to advertisers. Finally, they are \\u201Cclosed loop\\u201D businesses that attempt to keep users within their platforms.

However, their uses of AI vary: Some tech companies, like Google and Amazon, use AI for data mining and improving the efficiency of their products; others, like Facebook and Apple, use AI for data mining and improving their products\\u2019 user experience. Facebook and Apple have built powerful artificial intelligence research labs and invested heavily in applying AI to their products. Facebook, for example, uses AI for computer vision and natural language processing, which allow its users to tag photos and posts with detailed descriptions. Facebook also uses AI for emotion recognition, which lets users filter their newsfeed based on their current mood. Apple also uses AI for computer vision and natural language processing to improve the user experience across all its products, including the iPhone, Apple TV and Siri.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The rise of the big four tech companies has changed the business landscape. While new digital technologies have transformed many industries, they have particularly disrupted advertising, e-commerce and media. These three industries are essentially the digital platforms\\u2019 core businesses: They collect and analyze large amounts of user data and sell advertisements based on that data and they primarily exist as online platforms that keep users in-house.
