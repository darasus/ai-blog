Google\\u2019s core business model is based on collecting data about users and using it for targeted advertising. Google has built an incredibly successful advertising business by taking advantage of the data it collects about users: it knows which websites users visit, what they like and dislike, what they want to buy, etc. Google uses this data to place relevant ads on its own platforms or on other websites that are part of its advertising networks.

Amazon\\u2019s core business model is based on economies of scale: the company uses its massive customer base and the data it collects about their purchasing patterns to offer lower prices than its offline competitors. Amazon has built two highly profitable business lines: its online retail business and its cloud computing services.

For example, Facebook has built a powerful artificial intelligence initiative called \\u201CAI Research\\u201D that publishes academic papers on new AI-powered methods.
