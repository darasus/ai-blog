## Establish rules and boundaries with your dog.

When your dog is a puppy, it’s important to set boundaries and rules for them to follow. This can help prevent bad habits from forming or getting worse. It can also help prevent your pet from getting anxious or stressed out.

Start off with puppy training sessions where your vet or a professional can teach you some basic commands and what to expect from your puppy. After that, you’ll want to keep enforcing the rules you were taught. You can do this by putting your dog on a schedule and feeding it at the same time each day.

It’s also important to keep your dog on a leash or in a fenced area when you’re out in public. This will help keep your dog safe from other people and animals and from getting into trouble. Most importantly, it will also keep your dog from wandering into places where it might get hurt.

## Don’t reward bad behavior.

This one is easier said than done, but it’s important that you don’t reward bad behavior with food. This can cause your dog to develop bad eating habits and even gain weight. In addition, it can cause your dog to behave badly in other ways, like urinating in the house or jumping on people and furniture.

If you’re trying to train your dog to do something, like not begging at the table, and it does it wrong or starts to do something bad, don’t give it a treat. This will encourage your dog to keep making those bad choices and ignore the behavior you want it to do.

Instead, try to redirect your dog to do something good, like sitting or giving it a toy to play with. This will help train it to do what you want and ignore the bad stuff.

## Try clicker training to teach your dog the meaning of “No”.

Clicker training is a great way to teach your dog the meaning of “no” and other commands. Basically, you’ll want to train your dog to associate clicking sounds with treats so it will know what’s expected of it when you say “no”.

Start by introducing the click sound by itself at first. Then, start adding the “no” command after the click. You can use this same strategy to teach your dog other commands, like to sit or lay down.

To make the process go more quickly and smoothly, you can use a clicker app on your phone to make the clicking sounds for you. This will also save you some potential hand cramps from clicking so much.

## Use food as a reward when teaching your dog new things.

If you’re trying to train your dog to do something, like not begging at the table, use a treat as a reward. This will help encourage your dog to do what you want and ignore the bad habits.

It’s best to wait until your dog has learned what you want it to do before rewarding it, but using food to help the process along is fine. Just make sure the treat is small enough that your dog can eat it quickly and doesn’t fill up on it and ignore the trick you’re trying to teach it.

You should also wait to give your dog a treat until the command is fully complete. If you reward it halfway through, it might get distracted and forget what it was supposed to be doing in the first place.

## Teach your dog the “sit” command.

If your dog is jumping up on you and begging for food, a good way to stop it is to teach it to sit. Your dog probably already knows this command, but if it doesn’t, it’s easy to teach.

Start off by giving your dog the “sit” command and feeding it a treat when it does so. Repeat this a few times a day until your dog has the command down. Then, you can start using it to help train your dog to stop jumping up on you while you’re at the table.

Another way to use the “sit” command to train your dog to stop begging at the table is to have it sit in a different room while you’re eating. This will help keep it away from the table and reduce the amount of begging it does.

## Train your dog to come when called.

If your dog is running around your house, getting into stuff and causing a ruckus while you’re trying to eat, try to train it to come when you call its name.

Start off by saying your dog’s name when it’s near you and giving it a treat when it comes. Do this every day until your dog has the command down. Then, start trying to call your dog to come when you’re in another room.

It can take a while to train your dog to come when you call its name, but it’s worth it. This will help keep your dog safe while you’re eating and reduce the amount of damage it can do to your house.

## Help your pup understand what “no” means.

Dogs are social animals, but they don’t understand what “no” means like humans do. This is especially true for puppies, who are notoriously bad at understanding commands and following rules.

You can work on helping your dog understand what “no” means by redirecting the bad habits you’ve been working to train it to stop. If your dog starts to jump up on the table, say “no” firmly and make it sit back down.

If your dog starts to beg for food at the table, ignore it and don’t give it any attention while it’s doing so. This will help your dog learn what you don’t want it to do and hopefully get it to stop doing those things.

## Summary

Your dog is loyal and loving and will be happy to spend time with you, especially if you take the time to train it to do things it enjoys. When you're training your dog, be patient and consistent. You'll soon see the results you're hoping for and enjoy many years with a happy, obedient dog by your side. In return, your dog will be delighted that you're taking the time to teach it new things, and it will happily show its appreciation for your efforts with lots of love and affection, making for a truly rewarding friendship.

With these tips, you can crack down on those weird doggy habits and help them learn new things that will last a lifetime. Dogs are social animals and love spending time with their owners, so once you’ve trained them, they’ll be eager to follow your commands and enjoy spending time with you.
