One of the most common problems that dog owners face is their dog begging at the table. Dogs beg for food because they know that we have it and they want it. Begging can be a nuisance, especially when you are trying to enjoy a meal with your family or friends. The good news is that there are a few things that you can do to train your dog to not beg at the table.

The first thing that you need to do is to never give in to your dog's begging. This means that you should never give them food from the table, no matter how much they beg or how cute they look. If you give in even once, they will learn that begging gets them what they want and they will continue to do it.

Another thing that you can do is to feed your dog before you sit down to eat. This will help to take away their incentive to beg because they will already have food in their stomach. You can also try to keep them occupied during meal times by giving them a chew toy or bone to gnaw on.

Finally, if you catch your dog begging at the table, make sure to scold them firmly. Let them know that it is not acceptable behavior and that they need to stop doing it. With a little patience and consistency, you should be able to train your dog to not beg at the table.
