## Spring MVC

The Spring Framework is, hands down, one of the most popular Java web frameworks available today. Part of that popularity is based on its history: it’s been around for a long time and has a great history behind it.

But it’s also a great framework for building modern websites and applications, with all the latest and greatest frameworks and libraries built in. Spring JMS, Spring Security, and Spring Data are all part of the Spring family and can be used together, or independently, in any application.

From the start, the Spring Framework designed itself to be modular and extensible. That means that you can start out with just the pieces that you need, and add new modules as your application grows and requires more functionality. And when you do add something new, you can be sure that it will work with the rest of your application.

## Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages

Java is an incredibly versatile programming language, and one of the reasons for its success is its ability to be used in many different environments and contexts. The same Java code can be used to build desktop applications (like Windows or Mac applications), mobile apps, web applications, and much more. Java is also open source, which means that anyone can use it for free.

Java is used to build the front end of many web applications, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) is one of the languages used to build web apps. JSP is a server-side language that allows you to create static HTML pages that are stored in a server database and are sent to the browser as plain text.

## Struts 2 Framework

The open source Struts framework is designed to make developing web apps easier by providing a structured way to organize your code and make it reusable. Struts is an excellent Java web development framework for building robust web applications and is one of the first tools new developers are introduced to when learning Java.

As with most Java frameworks, it makes use of as much open source software as possible, including Apache Commons and Apache Jakarta libraries. It also has a large online community that benefits from the collaborative nature of open source work.

One of the best things about Struts is the fact that it’s categorized as a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. MVC frameworks allow you to separate the different parts of your app into different sections. In this case, the model is the database, the view is the web page, and the controller is the code that manages the communication between the two.

## Grails With Groovy

Grails is another Java web development framework that has been around since 2005 and is written in the Groovy language. It was designed to be an easy way to create data-driven websites and apps, and it takes full advantage of the Java platform.

Grails was created with the intention of making it easier for developers to work with Java. It uses convention over configuration, which means that the framework uses rules and assumptions to make decisions for you, such as naming conventions, environment settings, etc. This makes configuration easy and less time-consuming.

Grails is a powerful framework that makes it easy to build web applications and websites using Java. It supports many different databases, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server. It also comes with a number of built-in features that make it easy to create, maintain, and add new content to your website.

## Conclusion

The Java programming language has been around for a long time, but it’s still one of the most popular languages used today. And those who know how to use it best are in high demand among employers.

That means that the best developers out there who know how to work with Java are well-paid, happy individuals who love what they do. And the great news is that learning how to build web applications with Java is easier than ever thanks to the many different frameworks and libraries available.

We hope you’ve enjoyed this article and have discovered a new library or framework that will make your life as a Java developer easier and more productive.
