If you're like most people, you probably let your eating habits slide a bit during the winter months. But now that spring is here, it's time to get back on track! Here are three simple steps to spring clean your eating habits:

1. Cut out the junk food. This means saying goodbye to sugary snacks, processed foods, and anything else that's not good for you. Instead, focus on eating whole, nutritious foods that will give your body the energy it needs.

2. Get moving. Exercise is a great way to boost your metabolism and help your body burn off those extra calories. Even if you can't commit to a regular workout routine, make sure to get some movement into your day by taking a brisk walk or going for a bike ride.

3. Drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated is essential for good health, and it can also help to keep your hunger in check. So make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day, and avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice.

By following these simple steps, you'll be on your way to eating healthier and feeling great this spring!
