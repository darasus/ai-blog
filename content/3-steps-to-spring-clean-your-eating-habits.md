## Step 1: Identify Your Bad Habits

Before you can release a bad habit, you must first identify it. One way to do this is to keep a food journal. Food journals aren’t a single-use tool, though. They have a multitude of benefits, including improving your awareness of your eating habits and helping you identify the root causes of your eating issues.
Given that it’s spring and we’re trying to clean up our eating habits, you might want to start your journal with this question: “What foods do I eat that I shouldn’t?”
This question can help you identify the bad habits in your eating routine. For example, if you notice that you eat a lot of fatty and sugary foods, you may want to explore why you’re gravitating towards these. What is the underlying reason for this?
## Step 2: Learn Why You Eat What You Eat

Once you’ve identified your bad eating habits, you must learn why you eat the way you do. You can do this by exploring the following questions:

- Why do I eat this food? - What emotions do I associate with this food? - What does this food represent for me, both positively and negatively? - What is the purpose of this food for me? - Why do I eat this food over others?

These questions can help you uncover the reasons and emotions behind the bad habits in your eating routine.

Once you understand the underlying reasons for your eating, you can start to replace these bad habits with better ones.

## Step 3: Implement Solutions

Now that you’ve identified the bad habits in your current eating routine and learned why they’re a part of your diet, you can start to replace these bad habits with new, better ones.
For example, if you notice that you eat unhealthy, sugary foods because you’re bored, you can implement a few solutions to counter negative emotions and cravings.
For example, you could take part in a creative activity, such as painting or drawing, that takes your mind off of cravings. Or you could listen to soothing music, which can help you relax.
