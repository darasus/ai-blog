## Research is crucial

When it comes to writing an advice or tips article, the first step is always research. You need to be sure that your information is correct and up-to-date. It’s also important to know who your audience is, so that you can tailor your advice accordingly. If you don’t have a clear understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve, or if your information isn’t relevant to your target readership, any advice you give will be useless.

You may also want to consider the tone of your article. Is it going to be a list of do’s and don’ts, or a more casual approach? You don’t want to put off your readers by coming across too aggressively, or they’ll just stop reading.

## Write in the first person

When we say write in the first person, we mean write your article as if you’re talking to one person. If you’re tempted to jump right into the tips, resist the urge. Start by addressing your reader directly, especially if you’re writing an advice article. Let your reader know that you are talking to them, and why. You can also ask questions of your readers, which is a great way to get them more involved in the article. This is a very effective way to humanize your article, especially if you’re talking about a really dry topic.

By writing in the first person, you can make your article more personable, engaging, and less likely to come across as preachy or pretentious. This is especially important for advice articles, where you want to avoid coming off as condescending or unhelpful.

## Lay out your points

Once you’ve got your opening out of the way, it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty of your tips and advice. Remember to write like you’re talking to a friend - not a textbook. Keep your language conversational and easy to understand. Your readers don’t need to know all the ins and outs of your topic, they just need enough information to take action. Keep your points short, clear, and to the point. A few bullet points, combined with a friendly tone, is all you need to get your advice across.

## Come up with some snappy titles

When you’re brainstorming article titles, don’t settle for the first one that comes to mind. A strong, attention-grabbing title is the first thing your readers will see, so it’s worth taking a bit of time to come up with something snazzy. You don’t have to be silly or off-the-wall, but a bland, run-of-the-mill title won’t cut it. If you can’t come up with a title, go back to your research and see if there’s a topic that stands out as being more relevant.

If you’re struggling to come up with a killer title, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Ask your friends what they think sounds good, or try a site like Title Generator for some inspiration.

## Don’t forget to include helpful resources and tips

Once you’ve got your reader’s attention and you’ve laid out your points, it’s time to back up your advice with solid resources. If you’re talking about using up leftover cooked meals, provide links to websites with delicious leftover recipe ideas. You can also include links to other guides and resources that might be helpful to your readers, like guides on how to store leftovers, or how to plan ahead to avoid cooking too much food.

Your article should stand alone as one cohesive unit, but it’s also important to link to other helpful articles on your website or blog. This shows your readers that you’re not just in it for the quick buck - you’re in it for the long haul, and you want to provide as much value as possible.

## Wrapping up

Once you’ve written your article, it’s time to proofread it carefully. Look out for grammar mistakes, or sentences that don’t make sense. If you’ve been brainstorming in your notepad, go back and transcribe your article before you publish. This will give you a chance to read through your article again, and make sure everything is as good as it can be. Make sure that your article has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Give your readers a clear call-to-action at the end of your article - this will make it much easier for them to take action on your advice. Finally, make sure you publish your article. Don’t forget to promote it, too. High-quality advice articles are an excellent way to establish your authority in the industry, generate high-quality leads, and increase your website traffic.
