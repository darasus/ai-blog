When it comes to system administration and monitoring, the list of available solutions is nearly endless. There are numerous cloud-based offerings that make light work of monitoring resource usage and uptime. For performance monitoring and analysis, there are platform-specific solutions, such as New Relic or App Dynamics for applications written in Python or other popular languages. There are also general solutions like Statsd and Prometheus for collecting performance metrics from any program on your network. The list goes on\\u2014you can find anything from standard logging utilities to software-defined networking (SDN) controllers if you know where to look.\nThere are so many different tools that choosing one to learn as a system administrator can be challenging.

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways. Object-oriented programming is a way of writing programs that aims to reduce redundancy and increase modularity by using objects that have their own data fields and methods that act on those fields instead of global variables.
