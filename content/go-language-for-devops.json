  "summary": "Go is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google and was released as open source in 2009. Go is designed with simplicity and concurrency in mind and is known for its powerful type system. Go compiles to machine code that runs as fast as a program written in C or C++. The language is extremely fast as it compiles down to native code and can run on a wide range of computer systems. Go has great error handling and is easy to read, write, and understand the code.",

In simple terms, we want to cut down the time between a code being written and it being ready for production.\nWe often see developers writing messy codes that are difficult to read or understand. The same goes for Ops engineers who find it challenging to debug different errors in production. This is where the Go language comes into play.\nSince its launch in 2009, Go has gained immense popularity among software developers across the globe, who have even dubbed it \\u201Cthe new old thing\\u201D. It was developed by Google as an alternative to other languages that were slow and memory-intensive at that time.\nIf you are a developer looking forward to implement DevOps with the help of Go, this article is for you!

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways. Object-oriented programming is a way of writing programs that aims to reduce redundancy and increase modularity by using objects that have their own data fields and methods that act on those fields instead of global variables.

Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
