Go is designed with simplicity and concurrency in mind and is known for its powerful type system. Go compiles to machine code that runs as fast as a program written in C or C++.

This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
