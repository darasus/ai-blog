  "summary": "Go is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google and was released as open source in 2009. Go is designed with simplicity and concurrency in mind and is known for its powerful type system. Go compiles to machine code that runs as fast as a program written in C or C++. The language is extremely fast as it compiles down to native code and can run on a wide range of computer systems. Go has great error handling and is easy to read, write, and understand the code.",
  "intro": "When we think of DevOps, we think of ways to make operations more robust, efficient and faster. In simple terms, we want to cut down the time between a code being written and it being ready for production.\nWe often see developers writing messy codes that are difficult to read or understand. The same goes for Ops engineers who find it challenging to debug different errors in production. This is where the Go language comes into play. \nSince its launch in 2009, Go has gained immense popularity among software developers across the globe, who have even dubbed it “the new old thing”. It was developed by Google as an alternative to other languages that were slow and memory-intensive at that time. \nIf you are a developer looking forward to implement DevOps with the help of Go, this article is for you! Here you will find everything you need to know about Go and its use in DevOps:",
  "content": "## What is Go?\n\nGo is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google and was released as open source in 2009. Go is designed with simplicity and concurrency in mind and is known for its powerful type system. It is also a statically typed language.\n\nAccording to the Go user survey in 2018, the main use cases of Go are:\n- Web and HTTP services- Data processing and analytics- DevOps and CI/CD- Microservices- Network infrastructure- Robotics and autonomous vehicles- Serverless applications- System software\n\nThe rules of simplicity and concurrency are what make Go that popular among developers. Additionally, some of the other benefits that come with using Go are:\n- It is extremely fast as it compiles down to native code. This means it can run on a wide range of computer systems.\n- It is easy to read and write code in Go.\n- It has great tooling support.\n- It is a strongly typed language.\n- It has great support for multi-core systems.\n- It is open source and has a large community.\n- It is a great language to start your career with.\n\n## Why use Go for DevOps?\n\nIf you are wondering why you should use the Go language for DevOps, here are 5 reasons you will love:\n\n- Go is easy to learn and use.\n- Go is a type-safe language.\n- Go is easy to debug.\n- Go has great concurrency.\n- Go has great error handling.\n- Go is easy to parallelize and distribute.\n- Go has a simple syntax.\n\n## How to implement Go in your organization?\n\nThere are two ways you can implement Go in your organization. If you are working in a startup, you can ask your team to learn this language. If you are working with an established company, you can push for adoption of Go within your organization.\n\nIf you are part of a small team or startup, you can start with these simple steps:\n\n- Find out if there is a company-wide initiative or an individual who is interested in adopting Go.\n- Learn the basics of Go and try building something.\n- Start with something small, like creating a crawler or a small website.\n- Once you are confident enough, start contributing to open source projects.\n- Learn about the best practices and go architectural style. This will help you avoid common mistakes.\n- Once your team is confident with Go, ask your organization to adopt it.\n\n## Pros of using Go in DevOps\n\nYou must be wondering what the benefits of adopting Go are. Let’s find out!\n\n- Simplicity: If you are new to this language, you will love its simplicity. It is easy to read, write, and understand the code. This makes it an ideal choice for newbies and experienced developers.\n- Concurrency: This is one of the most important reasons to use Go for DevOps. The language is designed with concurrency in mind. This means that you can run multiple tasks at once. It also allows you to run the same program on multiple machines.\n- Robustness: Go is extremely robust and scalable. This means that it can run on a wide range of computer systems, from small devices to large computer clusters.\n- Performance: Go compiles to machine code that runs as fast as a program written in C or C++.\n- Ease of Deployment: Go is designed to be easy to deploy. You can write code, compile it, and run it all in one step. This makes it very easy to deploy your code. There are no complicated language runtimes to install.\n- Standard Libraries: Go comes with a standard library that has all the necessary building blocks for creating apps. This standard library is robust and has everything you need.\n- Fault Tolerance: Go has great error handling mechanisms. If there is an error in your program, you can set a handler for that error and continue with the program.\n- Easy to Scale: The language is designed to be easy to scale. You can run the same program on multiple machines and distribute the work.\n- Simple to Read: Go is a simple language to read. It is easy to understand and doesn’t have complicated syntax. This makes it ideal for newbies.\n- Easy to Understand: Go is simple to understand and has a small set of rules that make it predictable. This makes it easy to debug.\n- Standard: Go is one of the most standard languages. This makes it easy to adopt within an organization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you are looking to bring DevOps in your organization, you should consider using the Go language. It is simple, easy to use, and best suited for DevOps. It has great concurrency and is robust enough to run on a wide range of computer systems. It can be used both in backend and frontend development.\n\nIf you are thinking of adopting the Go language in your organization, the best time to do so is now. With the growing popularity of the language, it won’t be long before it becomes the standard programming language for software development."
