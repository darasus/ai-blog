summary: A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that keeps track
  of transactions between parties. It’s a secure database because it isn’t kept
  in one place but instead shared across networks of computers. A blockchain
  consists of a series of “blocks” that contain information about the
  transaction, including a time stamp, the type of asset being transferred, the
  amount of money or units being given and the account numbers of the parties
  involved. When applied to supply chain management, blockchain technology can
  be used to track the movement of goods from suppliers, through the production
  process to the final customer.
intro: The world of business is changing at a rapid pace, thanks to innovations
  in technology and a growing digital presence. From e-commerce platforms to
  social media, websites and apps, businesses can now market their services
  digitally to potential customers around the globe — while also connecting with
  vendors and partners virtually rather than in person.The emergence of
  blockchain technology as an accessible way to keep track of these kinds of
  interactions has led to its adoption in various industries. Blockchain for
  business isn’t just about cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum; it’s a way
  to decentralize information so that it’s not stored in one place but instead
  on many computers simultaneously. Understanding how blockchain technology can
  improve your business requires knowing what blockchain is, how it works and
  its potential applications — both current and future.

## What is Blockchain Technology?

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that keeps track of transactions between parties. It’s a type of database that functions as an open, non-reputable record. It’s a secure database because it isn’t kept in one place but instead shared across networks of computers that don’t belong to any central entity and can therefore’t be tampered with. A blockchain is made up of a series of “blocks” that contain information about the transaction, including a time stamp, the type of asset being transferred, the amount of money or units being given and the account numbers of the parties involved. Each block is then connected to the previous block, and the blocks are also secured using cryptography.

## How Does Blockchain Work?

A blockchain is a decentralized database that’s made up of many different nodes, each of which has a full copy of the ledger and keeps track of validating the digital transactions, or blocks, that are added to the chain. Because the nodes are decentralized, no single entity controls the blockchain. Each node is also an administrator of the ledger and verifies each transaction’s validity before adding a new block to the chain. This means that any changes made to any block will show up as a discrepancy in the other ledgers, triggering those nodes to re-validate the chain. In addition to the nodes, a blockchain also consists of two more components: a network and a token. The network is the group of nodes that make up the blockchain and enable its functionality. The token is a digital asset created by the blockchain that’s generally used as a form of payment for validating transactions.

## Blockchain in Business: Why Is It Important?

Blockchain is an important technology because it helps businesses reduce the risk of fraud and ensures that transactions are secure. When applied to supply chain management, blockchain technology can be used to track the movement of goods from suppliers, through the production process, to the final customer. When applied to escrow services, blockchain technology can be used to verify the legitimacy of both the supplier and the customers by keeping track of digital assets like money in an account. Customers can then verify that the funds have been deposited in the account before the supplier can release the items they’ve purchased. When applied to financial services, blockchain technology can be used to track the history of transactions made by both individual customers and businesses. Transactions can be verified by other parties to confirm that they’re legitimate.

## Supply Chain Management

The supply chain is an essential part of any business, no matter what industry you’re in. From finding new vendors to determining the best distribution channels for your products, you need to understand your supply chain to succeed. Blockchain technology can be used to track your supply chain using a distributed ledger that verifies each transaction. You can keep track of each part as it travels through the supply chain, recording shipping information like the dates and times, the names of the people involved and any other relevant data. You can also use blockchain to keep track of digital assets like inventory, money and orders — ensuring that they’re all accounted for and valid.

## Escrow Services

If you’re frequently doing business with clients or vendors in other countries, you know how difficult it can be to receive payment. In some places, the payment process can be incredibly inefficient, while in others it can be difficult or even impossible to receive payment at all. Blockchain technology can be used to ensure that both parties are protected during these types of transactions by using an escrow service based on distributed ledger technology. This means that the money or other digital assets are placed in an account that’s controlled by a third party, usually a blockchain platform.

## Financial Services

When it comes to business, you have to be able to trust your partners. Whether you’re using a vendor or contractor to provide a service or hiring a new employee, you need to be confident that they’re who they say they are and that they’re trustworthy. This is where blockchain technology can be helpful — especially in the financial sector. Blockchain technology can be used to keep track of a wide variety of information, including financial transactions, employee identification and even the supply chain.

## Conclusion

The world of business is changing, thanks to innovations in technology and a growing digital presence. From e-commerce platforms to social media, websites and apps, businesses can now market their services digitally to potential customers around the globe — while also connecting with vendors and partners virtually rather than in person. The emergence of blockchain technology as an accessible way to keep track of these kinds of interactions has led to its adoption in various industries. Blockchain for business isn’t just about cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum; it’s a way to decentralize information so that it’s not stored in one place but instead on many computers simultaneously.
