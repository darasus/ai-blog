intro: >-
  New technology is always built on old foundations, reacting to what came
  before and building new ideas on top of it. 

  EOS is a new blockchain operating system designed with neglected attributes in mind: speed, scalability, and user experience. It’s the fifth generation of blockchain technology, built to tackle the limitations of previous generations with an end goal of mass adoption.

  EOS is not simply another cryptocurrency—it’s a third-generation blockchain that functions as a decentralized operating system, introducing new concepts and mechanics from software development as a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce or Google Docs. In this article, we explore exactly what that means for you as an EOS token holder and potential investor.

## What is EOS?

EOS is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), similar to Ethereum. The EOS software is open source, allowing developers to build on the platform for free. EOS tokens are the native tokens of the EOS blockchain. EOS is currently trading at $5.13 according to CoinMarketCap as of July 13, 2019.

EOS is designed to enable commercial-scale decentralized applications by providing all of the necessary functionality to administer decentralized applications on the blockchain. This includes self-governing, self-regulating, and self-funding software. EOS is also designed to enable the next generation of decentralized applications, including a wide range of industries and social sectors.

## EOS: Built for Scaling

Scalability is the ability of a network to process a growing amount of transactions every second as the network grows. If a network can’t keep up, it becomes ineffective and unusable.
Ethereum, the second most popular blockchain after Bitcoin, is often criticized for its lack of scalability. It can currently process about 15 transactions per second—a large hinderance, given the number of people and businesses who want to use the technology.
EOS uses an innovative consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake (DPOS), where network participants select a small number of nodes to verify transactions and add blocks to the chain. This means that EOS has the potential to scale to thousands of transactions per second, with each transaction confirming in seconds.

## EOS: Built for Speed

Speed, or throughput, is the rate at which a system can perform a given task.
This bottleneck is something that every blockchain, including Bitcoin, has struggled with, which is why transaction times are so slow.
EOS is built with an architecture that makes it easier to add capacity as the network expands. It uses a parallel architecture that can handle millions of transactions per second. EOS also has built-in functionality that automatically adds more capacity as the network grows, making it easier to maintain consistent performance even as more people use the blockchain.

## EOS: Built for User Experience

Usability is a term used to describe the ease of use or simplicity of a product. A major issue with many new blockchain technologies is that they are difficult to use.
EOS is designed to make blockchain technology easier and more intuitive for everyone, both users and developers.
EOS achieves this by using a single-threaded blockchain architecture, where all transactions go through a single channel and are processed sequentially. This means that EOS should be easier to use and more predictable, with transactions being more consistent.

## How does it work?

EOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism. This means that token holders select a small number of nodes to verify transactions and add blocks to the chain.
EOS can scale to millions of transactions per second, while reducing energy consumption by distributing network participation according to the stake held by coin holders.
EOS achieves this by using a single-threaded blockchain architecture, where all transactions go through a single channel and are processed sequentially.
EOS also allows for parallel processing and interleaving of transactions, enabling large networks to function without requiring significant additional bandwidth.

## Who’s behind EOS?

EOS is an open-source project driven by the community. While the team behind the project is the company block.one, the EOS community consists of thousands of people from all over the world, with members from all walks of life.
EOS was founded by Dan Larimer, who also founded Steemit and BitShares. Larimer is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, having developed several successful projects.
EOS is advised by some of the most prominent people in the blockchain space, including Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal.
EOS has received funding from leading venture capital firms, including Galaxy Digital, Draper Associates, and other investors.

## How to buy the EOS token?

The main exchange where you can buy the EOS token is on the Binance exchange. If you don’t already have a Binance account, you’ll need to sign up for one. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be able to deposit Bitcoin (or another currency) and exchange it for EOS. You can also sign up for a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin there before trading it for EOS on Binance.
EOS is traded as EOS, and you can buy and sell as much of it as you want, as long as you have the funds in your Binance account.
EOS runs on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token. This means that you’ll need to have some Ethereum in your account to exchange it for EOS.

## Conclusion

EOS is a decentralized operating system built for commercial-scale decentralized applications. It uses a delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism that can process millions of transactions per second and can scale to serve a large number of users. It is designed to be simpler to use and has distributed ownership. EOS has received a lot of hype over the last year, and there is a lot of potential behind this project.
EOS is a complicated project, so if you’re interested in investing in it, make sure to do your research first.
