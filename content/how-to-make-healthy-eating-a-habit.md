intro: >-
  It’s frustrating to know that the right foods can also be the most
  difficult ones to eat regularly. We understand how eating a certain way can
  make us feel healthier, have more energy and even look better. So why is it so
  hard to do?

  We all know we should be eating more greens and protein and less carbs, sugar and fat… but then life happens. A busy schedule, cravings for unhealthy snacks or just the typical difficulties of adulting in general all contribute to the fact that we simply don’t eat as well as we know we should. 

  Luckily, making good eating habits stick isn’t impossible. It may seem like something you have to force on yourself every day, but there are things you can do to help make it easier over time. Here are some ways to help you develop healthy eating habits that last a lifetime.

## Commit to meal prep.

This may seem like an obvious one, but we promise it’ll help. If you don’t want to force yourself to eat the same foods day after day, you may struggle to keep up with your habits long term. Meal prepping will help you make sure you’ve got healthy food on hand that’s ready to go when you are. You’d be surprised at how much better you’ll feel when you’re not running around trying to grab something unhealthy at the last minute. Plus, prepping your food ahead of time is a great way to keep track of your daily calorie intake without having to track every detail of everything you’re eating.

## Try a new food at least once a week.

Part of making healthy eating a daily habit is exploring new kinds of foods as often as you can. Trying new things can help you find new favorites to add to your diet and make food more interesting and enjoyable. This can also make it easier to switch up your daily routine and shake things up a bit, so you don’t feel like you’re always eating the same old meals. Giving new foods a chance can also help you learn more about ingredients and nutrition in general, so you’re more able to make informed choices at the supermarket.

## Set an intention before every meal.

If you’re someone who tends to eat on the fly, setting an intention before each meal can help you focus on what you’re eating. This may sound silly, but it can help you slow down, be more aware of what you’re consuming and make improvements to your diet. Whether you want to focus on eating more vegetables, having less sugar or trying to increase your protein intake, setting an intention before every meal can help you stay on track.

## Take your vitamins.

This is something you may have been told since you were a kid, but it’s just as important as ever as an adult. Adults, teens and even kids who eat a well-rounded diet can struggle to get enough nutrients from food alone. This is especially true for vitamins like B, C, D and Calcium, as well as Iron for women who are menstruating. Getting enough of these nutrients can help keep you healthy, improve your energy levels and make sure your body is operating at its best.

## Don’t eat alone.

This may sound odd, but research has shown that eating with other people can help you eat less. Eating with others can also help you make better choices, as you’re more likely to choose a salad over a carb-heavy side when others are watching.

## Reward yourself for sticking to your diet.

This may sound a little silly, but it’s a good idea to reward yourself for eating healthily. When you’re committed to a new way of eating, it can help to have something to look forward to. This could be anything from a trip to the movies, to a new book, a relaxing bath and more. Find something that fits your lifestyle and makes you excited and eager to keep up with your diet choices.

## Conclusion

When you commit to eating healthier, it can be easy to feel like it’s something you have to force yourself to do every day. Hopefully, these tips show you that it doesn’t have to be that way. Eating well doesn’t have to be hard or feel like a chore. It can be something you enjoy and look forward to.
