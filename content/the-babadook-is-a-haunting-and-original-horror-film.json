  "title": "\"The Babadook\" is a haunting and original horror film",
  "summary": "The Babadook is an unpredictable monster that can trap people in their own minds and drive them to commit unspeakable acts without any clear reason as to why. It is a force that seems to be solely focused on driving Amelia to madness, but it doesn’t have a clear purpose or motivation behind its actions. The key to writing a successful horror story is to tap into these deep-seated fears and emotions that readers or movie-goers may not even be aware of.",
  "intro": "The horror genre has been saturated with the same old tropes for decades. Monsters, ghosts and psychotic killers are no longer frightening, so viewers instead get the same story with a different setting, characters and victim every time. The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days. From vampires to werewolves to Frankenstein’s monster and his re-imagined counterpart, Victor Frankenstein, there isn’t much left that hasn’t already been done multiple times before. In addition to those staples we’ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like “Them” from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts. But then again… The Babadook doesn’t exactly follow the same formulaic structure either.",
  "content": "## A Babadook by any other name would be just as frightening\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between The Babadook and other monster movies is its name. The monster in the film is called “The Babadook” rather than being named after the more traditional “thing that goes bump in the night.” The word “babadook” is never explained in the movie but is assumed to be an unknown word that the main character, Amelia, created herself to describe the monster’s presence.\n\nThis small twist in the story makes the monster a bit more vague than other monsters throughout horror history. Rather than having a clearly defined purpose, a physical form and a name that has already been well-established in the genre, The Babadook operates on a more abstract level that can’t quite be explained by the viewer.\n\nThis makes the monster scarier because it is mysterious. It is a force that seems to be solely focused on driving Amelia to madness, but it doesn’t have a clear purpose or motivation behind its actions. The Babadook is an unpredictable monster that can trap people in their own minds and drive them to commit unspeakable acts without any clear reason as to why. The lack of explanation is what makes it so scary.\n\n## A mother’s grief and a monster in the dark\n\nThe Babadook’s story begins with Amelia, a widow who lives alone with her young son, Samuel. She struggles with depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following the death of her husband in a car accident. The accident took Samuel’s legs and left him in a wheelchair.\nThe first sign of the Babadook’s arrival is the appearance of a mysterious pop-up book that contains a series of violent images and a poem about the monster.\nThe book turns up in various locations around the house, always appearing at exactly the same time each night, when Amelia is reading to Samuel. The book is a trigger for Amelia’s PTSD, causing her to panic and even hallucinate as she reads the poem out loud.\n\nThe Babadook’s sudden arrival in the family’s home is a manifestation of Amelia’s guilt, grief and depression. Just like the Babadook’s sudden appearance, Amelia’s husband died suddenly and left behind a trail of sadness and regret.\n\n## Writing effective horror is difficult…\n\nThe Babadook’s story is driven by the characters’ emotions, making it an effective thriller, but it is also a psychological horror story. It explores the fear of the unknown, the fear of being trapped in one’s own mind and the fear of a loved one losing their sanity.\nThe Babadook feeds on people’s pain and uses that to grow stronger. As Amelia’s guilt and grief grow stronger, the Babadook gains more power and turns her sadness into a weapon against her loved ones.\nThe movie ends with Amelia regaining control of her life and the Babadook fading back into the shadows. She has overcome her grief and guilt, the monster’s main source of food, and the Babadook has been defeated.\n\n## …But not impossible.\n\nThe key to writing a successful horror story is to tap into these deep-seated fears and emotions that readers or movie-goers may not even be aware of. Exploring someone’s guilt or anxiety in a way that is not obvious or easy to identify is a tricky task. It is important to not let the reader or viewer know exactly what is causing the anxiety.\nPeople often turn to horror because they want to explore their dark side and see how they would react in a situation that is outside of their normal comfort zone. Therefore, it is important to not let the reader or viewer in on how to defeat the monster or how to avoid being trapped in their own head.\nIt is also important to not make the story too obvious. If the reader can see exactly what is going to happen during the story and how it will end, then they have little incentive to continue reading.\n\n## What makes The Babadook so unique?\n\nThe difference between The Babadook and other horror stories is that it focuses on the trauma that the monster feeds on. The Babadook’s appearance in the story can be traced back to a specific event, to a specific person and specific emotions.\nThe event is the death of a loved one and the emotions are grief and guilt.\nThere are many different sources of pain that could have been used to create the monster in this story. Unfortunately, those sources are pain that many readers and viewers may experience in their own daily lives.\nThe Babadook is a unique monster because it feeds on pain that many readers might not even be aware that they have. It is a monster that may have existed in the reader’s lives since childhood.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again by exploring the darker aspects of human emotion and tapping into the fears of childhood (but in a way that is not childish).\nIf you are looking for a fresh twist on the horror genre, then The Babadook is a must-read or must-see. It is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again by exploring the darker aspects of human emotion and tapping into the fears of childhood (but in a way that is not childish)."
