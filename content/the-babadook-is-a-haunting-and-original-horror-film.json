This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.
