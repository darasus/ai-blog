intro: >-
  Today’s systems administrators have many tools at their disposal. When it
  comes to system administration and monitoring, the list of available solutions
  is nearly endless. There are numerous cloud-based offerings that make light
  work of monitoring resource usage and uptime. For performance monitoring and
  analysis, there are platform-specific solutions, such as New Relic or App
  Dynamics for applications written in Python or other popular languages. There
  are also general solutions like Statsd and Prometheus for collecting
  performance metrics from any program on your network. The list goes on—you can
  find anything from standard logging utilities to software-defined networking
  (SDN) controllers if you know where to look. 

  There are so many different tools that choosing one to learn as a system administrator can be challenging. In this article, we’ll explore some of the most relevant options when it comes to system administration tasks and their unique needs as system administrators with a focus on Python due its usage among SysAdmins).

## Python for System Administration

Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world, and with good reason. It is a concise, readable language that is both readable and writable by humans and machines. Python’s strong core library and massive third-party library support makes it an extremely powerful language. It is also cross-platform and can be used on practically any computer.

One of the best reasons to use Python for system administration is its large ecosystem of libraries. As a Python developer, you have access to a large number of standard libraries that allow you to do things like write to and read from files, access and manipulate web pages, and download and parse RSS feeds. There are also an enormous number of third-party libraries available, with more being developed every day.

## Shell Scripting

Shell scripts are another great option for system administrators. These are plain text files that contain commands that are executed by the operating system kernel. While you can write shell scripts in a wide variety of languages, using the language native to your operating system offers the most portability and flexibility.
A shell script can be as simple as a few lines of code that are used to automate a process, or it can be as complex as a full-blown application. Whatever the scope of your shell scripts, they can save you a tremendous amount of time and effort if used correctly.

## Installing and Managing Software

If you work as a system administrator, you know that software installation is part of the job. You will often have to install and manage software on both your own systems and on others’ systems that you might be administrating remotely. Fortunately, there are tools available to make this process as easy as possible.
There are many tools that can help you to install software on your systems. You can use traditional tools like apt-get and yum, but there are also more modern solutions like Chocolatey and Homebrew. These tools have a variety of benefits over the standard command-line utilities.
While these tools make the process of installing and managing software easier, you’ll still have to be careful about how you manage your software. You should always think about how your software is organized and installed to make sure that it is easy to remove.

## Monitoring and Auditing

Monitoring and auditing are two critical aspects of system administration. Whether you are monitoring your systems to make sure they are running smoothly or auditing them to make sure they are secure, you can make use of many tools to get the job done.
There are a variety of monitoring and auditing tools available. Some are designed to monitor a specific technology, such as monitoring an application for performance issues or debugging. Others are designed to monitor general system information like cpu and memory utilization.
There are also tools available that can be used for both monitoring and auditing. These tools can be used to monitor the health of your system and to audit the security of your system.

## python-based monitoring tools for system administrators

There are many python-based monitoring tools for system administrators. In this section, we’ll dive into a few of the most common ones.

- Statsd and Graphite
Statsd and Graphite are two monitoring tools that are written in Python. These tools work well together and can be used to monitor a variety of system metrics.
- New Relic
