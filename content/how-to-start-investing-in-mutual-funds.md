## What is a mutual fund?

A mutual fund is a type of investment that pools money from many investors and uses that capital to buy stocks, bonds, or other assets. Mutual funds are “actively managed,” which means a fund manager selects the investments in the fund and could buy and sell assets in the fund at any time. Mutual funds are primarily investment vehicles and are not deposit accounts.

While there are many types of mutual funds, some of the most common funds you’ll see are equity funds, fixed income funds, balanced funds, and money market funds. Equity funds invest in stocks of companies in the U.S. and abroad. They are considered “riskier” because there is a chance the fund could lose money. Fixed income funds invest in government and corporate bonds. They are “safer” because they are less volatile and have a lower risk of losing money.

## Mutual fund investing basics

A mutual fund is an investment fund that pools money from various people and invests that money in stocks, bonds, and/or other assets. Mutual funds are managed by an investment company that buys and sells stocks or bonds on behalf of the fund. Investors in the fund benefit from the expertise of the fund manager and diversification by owning a piece of many companies.

Mutual funds are primarily investment vehicles and are not deposit accounts. They invest your money in stocks, bonds, and other assets, not cash. When you invest in a mutual fund, you are buying shares of the fund.

## How much do mutual funds cost?

Like with everything, investing in mutual funds comes with a cost. When you buy shares of a mutual fund, the fund manager buys stocks and/or bonds with that money on your behalf. The fund manager also has a salary, office, and other operating costs.

Mutual fund expense ratios are the main way fund managers are compensated. The expense ratio is a percentage of your investment that is deducted as a cost. It includes the fund manager’s salary and other management expenses. Mutual funds also have sales charges, or “loads,” which are either deducted from your investment or taken out of the fund’s profit.

Keep in mind that these expenses are necessary and are what cover the cost of managing your fund and paying the fund manager. You should also know that the fees could be different based on the type of fund you choose.

## Why invest in mutual funds?

Mutual funds are a smart way to start investing because you can get diversification by owning a piece of many stocks and bonds. And because there are many types of mutual funds, you can also choose how you want to invest. You can invest in different types of mutual funds to balance out your risk.

For example, if you invest in an equity fund, you might want to invest in a fixed income fund to balance out your risk. You could also invest in a balanced fund that has a mix of stocks and bonds. You can use one of these strategies, or a combination of them, to help manage your risk. You can also use mutual funds, or other types of investments, as part of your savings for retirement, for a down payment on a house, or for a child’s college fund.

## Considerations before investing in mutual funds

Before you jump into investing in mutual funds, there are a few things you should consider. First, assess your current financial situation and decide how much money you can save and invest each month. Ideally, you want to start early and save as much as you can.

Next, decide how much risk you are comfortable with. The risk is how much you could lose compared to how much you could make. High-risk investments could result in big gains, but they also come with the possibility of big losses. Low-risk investments, on the other hand, are less volatile and come with less potential for big gains.

Finally, choose a mutual fund based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. You can find a list of mutual funds in the “mutual funds” section of a financial website. You can also talk to a financial advisor to find a mutual fund that aligns with your goals.
