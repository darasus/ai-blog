  "intro": "Coding is an essential skill that can be applied to a variety of roles, industries and company sizes. What started as a niche skill used by software developers is now a marketable and relevant skill for almost every industry. It has become so ubiquitous that even the Department of Labor has highlighted coding as one of the fastest growing skills in demand. \nCoding is most commonly thought of as the ability to create websites, apps and software. However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. The type of coding you choose to learn may have different applications depending on your interests, career trajectory and personal strengths. Read on to learn more about the various types of coding, as well",
  "content": "## Why You Should Learn To Code\n\nFirst and foremost, learning to code will open up new opportunities for you in whatever field you are currently in. Let's face it, it's a skill that is in high demand, and knowing how to code will give you a leg up on the competition.\n\nYou'll have more career options. If you want to move into a new industry or area, but think you don't have the necessary skills, learning to code will help you build those skills. It's a skill that transcends industries and can be applied to just about any job.\n\nYou can start a side hustle. Learning how to code can be a great way to start a side hustle, especially if you want to go the coding bootcamp route where you can get a great amount of experience in a short amount of time.\n\nYou can create something new or solve a problem you may have personally encountered. Coding is an incredibly creative process, and once you get into it, you'll find there's almost no limit to what you can create.\n\n## Types of Coding\n\nThere are many types of coding that you can learn. Here are the most common types that you can explore:\n\n- Web Development: the creation of websites and web applications, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designing, building and managing websites are also included in this field.\n\n- Software Development: the process of designing and building software applications. The most common languages used in software development are Java, Ruby, and Python, but many more exist.\n\n- Mobile Development: the creation of applications for mobile devices (e.g. apps for Android and iOS). The most common languages used in mobile development are Java, Swift and JavaScript.\n\n- Artificial Intelligence: the creation and programming of machines to act and think like humans. This is a very general field with many applications in the real world, such as robotics.\n\n- Data Science: the study and exploration of data to find meaningful patterns, insights and relationships. This field uses programming extensively, as well as machine learning and statistical analysis.\n\n- Data Engineering: the process of managing and organizing data so that it can be used in other systems. This field also includes building software for managing data.\n\n- Cyber Security: the protection and safeguarding of systems from malicious attacks, viruses and other harmful activity. This field requires programming skills as well as knowledge of computer systems.\n\n## How to get started with coding\n\nThere are a few ways you can get started with coding. If you're interested in learning website development, you can start by learning HTML and CSS. If you're interested in mobile development, you can learn Swift or other languages used for apps. If you're interested in artificial intelligence, you can learn more about machine learning and data science.\n\nThere are tons of free resources available online where you can start learning. Some of the best websites for beginners are CodeAcademy, Coursera, Udemy and Edureka. If you already have a specific programming language in mind, you can use any of its online resources to start learning. If you're not sure what language to learn, this article will help you choose the right coding language to learn based on your interests and strengths.\n\n## Online courses for coding\n\nIf you'd like to get a more structured education in coding, there are plenty of online courses you can find on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX. These platforms offer a wide variety of courses from top universities around the world, as well as coding bootcamps from established coding schools.\n\nThe best way to find the right course for you is to decide which type of coding you want to learn. Once you know which field interests you, you can use this list of top online courses to help you find the right course.\n\n## Computer programming languages\n\nComputer programming languages are used to write instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. There are thousands of different programming languages, and a few of the most common ones are listed below. It's important to note that a given language might have different subtypes or versions, which are determined by the use case of the language.\n\n- Java - A general-purpose programming language that can be used for many types of applications.\n\n- Python - A general-purpose high-level language that is often used for data science and machine learning applications.\n\n- C++ - A general-purpose programming language used for a variety of applications, though it is most often used for system software.\n\n- Swift - A general-purpose programming language used to build apps for iOS and Apple devices.\n\n- R - A programming language used for data analysis and visualization.\n\n- JavaScript - A general-purpose language that is commonly used in web development and client-side programming.\n\n## Programming platforms\n\nOnce you've decided on a language, you'll need to pair it with a programming platform. Using the right programming platform will help you get started with coding faster, and make the process easier.\n\nHere are some of the most common programming platforms:\n\n- Java - Java is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for many types of applications.\n\n- Python - Python is a general-purpose high-level language that is often used for data science and machine learning applications.\n\n- C++ - C++ is a general-purpose programming language that is often used for system software.\n\n- JavaScript - JavaScript is a general-purpose language that is commonly used in web development and client-side programming.\n\n- R - R is a programming language that is used for data analysis and visualization.\n\n- Swift - Swift is a general-purpose programming language used for apps for iOS and Apple devices.\n\n## Summing up\n\nCoding skills are in high demand right now and are a great skill to have. With the right knowledge, you can build apps, websites and software programs.\n\nWith more and more industries starting to rely on tech, the demand for skilled coders will only increase. Having an understanding of how to code will give you a skill that is marketable and relevant for almost every industry.\n\nNow that you know the basics of coding, what types of coding exist and what languages and platforms exist, you're ready to get started."
