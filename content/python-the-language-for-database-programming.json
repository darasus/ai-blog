  "summary": "Python is a general-purpose programming language with a simple syntax and powerful standard library. It is a great choice for beginner programmers due to its relative ease of use compared to other languages such as Java, C/C++, or C#. Python can be used for almost any programming task, from web development to data science. The language was developed in the late 1980s by a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was conceived as a “better C” - a language that could be used by non-programmers.",
