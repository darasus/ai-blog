intro: >-
  Software developers are some of the most valuable employees in many
  companies. They can take an idea and turn it into a useful product that people
  want to use. The best coders are constantly looking for ways to improve their
  skills and find new ways to make their work easier and more efficient.
  Fortunately, there are plugins available for almost any coding program out
  there. 

  Coding plugins can significantly improve your productivity and effectiveness as a programmer by making your workflow faster and more efficient. These plugins cover everything from debugging to searching for code snippets you may have forgotten about but will be grateful to have again should you need them again someday. Here’s a list of the best coding plugins for developers that can help make your job easier, simpler and more productive:

## Code Runner

This is a really helpful plugin for JavaScript developers. Code Runner lets you run your JavaScript code right inside your text editor, so you can see how your code works without having to leave your editor to run it in a browser.
This plugin is really helpful when you’re trying to debug code that’s not working correctly. Instead of having to jump between your code editor and a browser to see how the code changes when you use the debugger, Code Runner lets you see those changes instantly in your text editor.

## Double Check

If you work with code frequently, there’s a good chance you’ve forgotten to add a few semicolons or parenthesis or you’ve forgotten a bracket or two. These seemingly small mistakes can cause some serious problems down the road, especially when you’re trying to debug your code.
That’s why it’s a good idea to install the Double Check plugin for your code editor. Double Check scans your code while you type and shows you any mistakes you’re making. It will even detect problems with your code that you didn’t know existed.

## Duet Display

Even if your team members are in the same room together, it can be helpful for one person to see what’s happening on another person’s computer screen. Using Duet Display, you can share the contents of your screen with another person’s computer instantly.
Duet Display is not a video or audio call – it’s a plugin that uses your computer’s browser to share what’s on your computer screen with a remote computer. This plugin is helpful when you need to show someone how to do something on your computer but they aren’t physically with you.

## ESLint

We’ve all worked with developers who have a really strict code formatting style. And we’ve also probably worked with people who aren’t concerned with how the code looks as long as it works.
ESLint is a code linter that you can install in your code editor that will help you write code in the same format as your team members. This plugin will verify your code for syntax errors and potential problems like using too many curly brackets or forgetting to use a semicolon.

## Exposer

We all know that code doesn’t always get written perfectly the first time. Sometimes you have to make a change to code that already exists in your project. What happens if you need to change code in a file that’s several directories deep?
Exposer is a code explorer that lets you navigate your project and find the file you need to change. You can search for a filename, partial or a variable name and this plugin will let you jump to the file in a split-screen explorer window so you can make your change.
Exposer has a few other handy features, like being able to jump to a specific line of code so you don’t have to scroll through your project trying to find the right place to make your change.

## #Task Runners: Tasks and Behaviors

Task runners like Gulp, Grunt, and Webpack are incredibly helpful for automating the repetitive tasks you do while developing. You can use these task runners to do things like minify your CSS and minify and optimize your JavaScript.
There are also plugins available that can help you add tasks and behaviors to your code editor. CodeWorld lets you set tasks and behaviors in your code editor and then have those features compiled into your build process.

## GitPlus - Sync, Review and Deploy With Git

Git is a powerful tool for managing code, but it can be difficult for developers to use.
GitPlus takes the confusion out of Git so you can use it more effectively and efficiently. You can sync folders with remote servers, review the changes you’ve made recently and collaborate with your team members more easily.

This plugin also allows you to use features like creating a branch and then merging it back into your main code branch and deploying your project live to a server with one simple click.

## Grammarly Writing Tool

Programming is a creative process and creativity is often associated with writing. Many programmers write code as if it were a written document.
Grammarly can be helpful for any type of writer, but it can be especially helpful for programmers who write code. This plugin will check your code for grammar and syntax errors and make suggestions for how to improve your code’s readability and understandability.

## LiveEditor – Real-time Coding Changes Previewer

This is another helpful plugin for JavaScript developers. LiveEditor lets you change your code and see those changes instantly in the browser.
You can also use this plugin to code with a team member who is remote. You can write the code in your editor and your partner can make changes to the code in their editor.

When you’ve written the code, you can use LiveEditor to send it to your partner. They can then make changes to their code editor and send those changes back to you. This plugin makes it easier to code together remotely because you both see each other’s changes instantly.

That’s a wrap for our list of the best coding plugins for developers. Hopefully you’ll find at least one of these plugins helpful in your day-to-day coding tasks. If you’d like to comment or recommend a plugin that we missed, we’d love to hear from you!
