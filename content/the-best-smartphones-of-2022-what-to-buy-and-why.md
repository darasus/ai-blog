intro: >-
  Smartphone technology is constantly evolving, and the best smartphones of
  2022 will be much different than even the most cutting-edge devices of today.
  These innovations won’t just be incremental improvements on the features we
  take for granted right now; they will be game-changing changes that make a big
  difference in how we use our phones.

  Today’s best smartphones are fast and powerful, with high resolution cameras, long battery life, crisp displays and more. But by 2022, these devices may seem almost Stone Age in comparison to what comes after them. Read on to learn about some of the biggest upcoming changes in smartphone tech, along with details about which models you should consider buying if you’re shopping for a new phone in 2022.

## Big Screen Turns to Small Screen

The big smartphone trend we’ve seen in recent years is big screens. Some of the best smartphones of 2018 have massive 6-inch screens or larger, and many of the best smartphones of 2019 and beyond will likely have even larger screens.
But the best smartphones of 2022 will buck this trend and offer smaller screens, though they will retain the same large-screen look with perhaps even larger displays thanks to edge-to-edge designs and better screen-to-body ratios.
The reasons behind this shift are twofold: First, consumers are indicating they want smaller devices, as evidenced by the success of the iPhone X. Second, smaller screens will be more energy efficient, which will be critical as the world increasingly transitions to renewable energy sources.

## Wireless Charging Becomes the Norm

Smartphones are at their best when they don’t need to be plugged in. But most devices still require a charger at least once a day, which can be a hassle.
This changes in 2022, when wireless charging becomes the standard.
In 2022, wireless charging will have moved beyond novelty status, with the best smartphones of 2022 offering built-in wireless charging. It’s likely that most charging pads will have migrated away from the wall, with charging pads built into tables and couches, and even built into cars and public infrastructure like lampposts.

## OLED Displays Will Be the New Standard

The best smartphones of 2022 will be packed full of cutting-edge tech, but one of their most basic features will be surprisingly old-school: their displays.
Air will be the preferred display type in 2022, as OLED has been largely abandoned in favor of its more energy-efficient cousin.
This switch will be driven in large part by the adoption of 5G networks, which will require much more energy-efficient devices. OLED screens are also more susceptible to power surges than air-based displays.

## AI Helps Us Find and Organize Our Data

Smartphones are great for keeping us organized, but there is only so much they can do. They can’t remind us when to pay bills, track our health or organize our finances.
AI becomes much more prevalent in 2022, as it is built into everything from our everyday apps to our operating systems.
While most AI will be used to enhance our phones, it will also be used to organize our data. AI will be able to recognize images, and will automatically tag them for easy organization. AI will also be able to understand voice commands and, in the future, written texts.

## Messaging Becomes an Operating System

The best smartphones of 2022 will be more than just a way to communicate with friends and family, they will be a way to communicate with the world.
The shift in 2022 is away from apps and toward messaging services, which will be built directly into phone operating systems.
This shift is due to a few factors. First, more people are using messaging services like Facebook Messenger rather than downloading individual apps. Second, phone OSes are being designed to support this trend.
And finally, messaging apps are increasingly competing with social networks.

## Confirmed: Dual Screen Phones Are Coming

Dual screen phones have been a sci-fi fantasy for years, but they are finally becoming a reality. The best smartphones of 2022 will feature two screens: one at the front and one on the back.
These screens will work together to create an augmented reality that blends virtual images with the real world.
These second screens will also likely be built into larger models, as manufacturers like Samsung and Apple have a history of releasing “phablets” with larger screens.

## Conclusion

The smartphone is the most important invention of the 21st century, and it is constantly evolving. The best smartphones of 2022 will have completely different designs, features and functions than today’s devices.
And while these changes will be significant, they’re also likely to be evolutionary, as smartphone manufacturers don’t want to make drastic changes that will confuse their users.
By 2022, smartphones will be smaller, more energy-efficient and packed with new features that were once only dreamed of.

If you’re shopping for a new phone, it’s best to wait until 2022 to make your purchase. By then, the best smartphones of 2022 will likely be available, and they will be much better than their predecessors.
