summary: Python is an interactive, object-oriented, high-level programming
  language designed to be readable and flexible. It is mainly used for web
  development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and
  software engineering. Python code can be written in a way that is
  “human-readable” with proper indentation. It can be used to analyze large
  amounts of data quickly, which is important in the context of scientific
  computing. Python is easy to learn, easy to read, has a large community of
  users, and is open source.
intro: >-
  Scientists need to ask questions, find answers and recognize patterns to
  uncover new knowledge. Python is a programming language that makes it easy for
  anyone to do this type of analytical work. It also excels at processing data
  faster than any other language. Because of these reasons, scientists are using
  Python more and more in their work. In fact, Python has become the most
  popular programming language used by scientists today. 

  A scientific computing software package called “Orange” inspired the creation of Python because its creator wanted to make something easier to use. Other programming languages like MATLAB were not user-friendly enough for general-purpose scientific computing so Guido van Rossum created his own version of it. He named it “Python” after the British comedy group Monty Python – he was a fan -- and published it as an open source project in 1991 with the New York University AI Lab as its first users.

## What is Python?

Python is an interactive, object-oriented, high-level programming language designed to be readable and flexible. It is mainly used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and software engineering. The syntax of this language allows users to express concepts in fewer lines of code with fewer syntactical elements than other languages. This can reduce the reading time for people who are less familiar with the language. Python code can be written in a way that is “human-readable” with proper indentation. The interpreter of the language is available online and can be used to write, run and test code in any programming environment. This makes Python an excellent choice for beginners who want to learn programming.

## Why use Python for scientific computing?

Python is an excellent choice for scientific computing because it is easy to learn, easy to read, has a large community of users, and is open source. These features make it easy to collaborate with others, making it a good choice for large projects. While Python is being used mostly for data analysis, it can also be used to develop and deploy complete applications, like a website or a mobile app. Because it is designed to encourage readability, Python is a good choice for scientists who need to share their code with others. This language can be used to analyze large amounts of data quickly, which is important in the context of scientific computing.

## Key Advantages of Python for Scientific Computing

Readable Code - Python code is easy to read, making it accessible to others who are less familiar with the language. This is important for collaboration in team-based projects.

Speed - Python is known to be a fast programming language, so it’s an excellent choice for scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning.

Collaboration - Python is an excellent choice for large projects that involve collaboration between scientists from different disciplines.

Data analysis - Python has many data analysis libraries, making it a good choice for scientists who need to analyze large amounts of data quickly.

## data analysis

Data analysis with Python is often done using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-Learn. Pandas is a library for data analysis and visualization. It is designed to work with large data sets and make them easily accessible by adding structure, rearranging the data, and applying visualization tools. NumPy is a library that provides advanced computation with large collections of numerical data. With SciPy, you can do engineering, scientific, and mathematical computing. Scikit-Learn is an open source machine learning library that makes data analysis easy. It has several algorithms, makes it easy to add new algorithms and has good visualization capabilities.

## Conclusion

Python has become the most popular programming language used by scientists today. This is largely because it is easy to learn, easy to read, has a large community of users, and is open source. These features make it easy to collaborate with others, making it a good choice for large projects.

Scientists need to ask questions, find answers, and recognize patterns to uncover new knowledge. Python is a programming language that makes it easy for anyone to do this type of work. It also excels at processing data faster than any other language. Because of these reasons, scientists are using Python more and more in their work.
