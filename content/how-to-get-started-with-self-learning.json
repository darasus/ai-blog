This makes them different from supervised learning algorithms or even reinforcement learning bots, which both require a human operator or some sort of rewards system to determine whether the AI is performing optimally or not.\nFurther, Self-learning algorithms are particularly useful for applications which have large datasets with many variables and little pre-existing knowledge about how those variables impact one another \\u2013 such as stock market analysis, speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
