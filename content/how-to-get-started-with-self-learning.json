  "intro": "Learners of today are different from learners of yesterday. Today's learners want to be active and take charge of their own learning experience, rather than being passive recipients of information. They prefer to learn at a time and place of their choosing, rather than fixed class schedules. Instead of focusing on memorizing facts and figures, they desire hands-on experiences and interactive solutions. In other words, modern learners want self-directed learning that is current and relevant—and thankfully there are many ways to achieve these goals.  Self-learning is an effective way for adults to acquire new knowledge and skills, usually in a field they already have interest in or a career they plan to enter. Many adults shy away from self-learning because they think it’te scary or difficult; it actually requires much less time than you might expect! Here’s how to get started with self-learning right now:",
  "content": "## A Short Guide to Self-Learning\n\nThe first step to effective self-learning is finding the right resource for your interests and goals. There are many options available to suit a wide range of interests. The following resources have been shown to be effective in helping adults learn and grow by self-directing their own education.\n\n- Learning By Doing\n\nChoose a skill that’s relevant to your interests and lifestyle. If you love hiking, consider becoming a rock climber. If you’re passionate about skateboarding, try your hand at designing your own skateboard deck. When choosing a skill to learn, try to select something that will benefit others as well. Being active in your community is a great way to apply new skills, meet new people, and feel productive.\n- eLearning\n\neLearning or online learning allows you to take advantage of the convenience of online courses to further your education. Whether you are curious about a new subject, or looking to earn a degree, online courses offer the flexibility and convenience you need to succeed. While many online courses offer self-paced options, some require you to attend set lectures or view recordings of live classes.\n\n- Books\n\nThere are many subjects that are best acquired through reading. How-to books are often written by experts in their fields and provide a useful overview of skills and techniques. Other books may provide insight into a particular subject or historical event. Fiction and non-fiction both have their place in self-learning.\n\n- Podcasts\n\nPodcasts are a great way to acquire new knowledge on the go. You can listen while commuting, exercising, or even doing housework. There are many options in every subject area, from news and politics to history, science, philosophy, and religion. Many podcasts are hosted by experts in their fields and provide an excellent way to stay up-to-date with current events.\n\n- Online Courses\n\nOnline learning is a growing field that offers many benefits for self-learners. Many online courses are offered through reputable universities and are designed for people who want to learn but don’t want to pursue a degree. There are many free online courses available. These may or may not provide course credit. You may also want to consider paid online courses that provide an instructor and course materials.\n\n- Video Games\n\nVideo games are more than just a fun hobby; they can also be an effective way to learn new skills and gain knowledge. There are video games designed to teach a wide range of skills that may be useful in your life, such as language and cultural skills, first aid, and even financial literacy. Additionally, many games offer a way to connect with other players and communities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelf-learning is an excellent way to further your education and expand your knowledge in almost any subject. However, it is important to note that self-learning is different from self-teaching. While self-learning involves acquiring new knowledge and skills through various means, self-teaching focuses on learning materials that are meant for children. Be sure to choose materials and activities that are appropriate for your age and skill level."
