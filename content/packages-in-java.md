Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming collisions as well as to control access level. Packages also allow you to structure your code in a more efficient way. 

There are two types of packages in Java: 
- Built-in packages, which are packages that come with the JDK. 
- User-defined packages, which are packages that you create. 

Some of the most popular built-in packages in Java are: 
- java.lang: Contains classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. 
- java.io: Contains classes for supporting input and output operations. 
- java.util: Contains utility classes, such as data structures and algorithms, that are not part of the core Java API. 
- java.net: Contains classes for supporting network communications. 
- java.awt and javax.swing: Contain classes for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
