summary: The abbreviation “JDK” stands for Java Development Kit. It’s a software
  development kit that contains everything you need to run Java programs. The
  JDK contains the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), the core Java libraries and the
  tools to write, run and debug your code. The Java programming language is a
  versatile and powerful language that is used to run on a wide range of systems
  and platforms. By grouping related classes and sub-packages into a single
  definition, you can make your code easier to understand and reuse.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

The JDK is the official implementation of the Java programming language. The abbreviation “JDK” stands for Java Development Kit. It’s a software development kit that contains everything you need to run Java programs. The JDK contains the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), the core Java libraries and the tools to write, run and debug your code. Depending on the operating system you’re on, you’ll typically find the JDK installed already. For example, if you’re on a Mac running macOS, click “App Store” and search for “Java”. Click “Get” for the JDK and follow the steps to install it. If you’re on Windows, you can get the JDK from Oracle’s website.

## java.lang

The java.lang package contains basic types and support classes for the Java language. It contains the java.lang.Object class, which is the root of the inheritance hierarchy for all objects in the Java programming language. Some of the important classes in this package are String, Integer, and Boolean. It also contains the java.lang.System class, which provides static methods for controlling the operation of the Java virtual machine.

## java.io

The java.io package provides support for stream-based input and output. It contains classes for reading and writing to binary files, and for converting between different character encodings. It also contains classes for working with network sockets, and the ability to read from and write to raw sockets.

## java.util

The java.util package contains commonly used data structures and algorithms, and provides support for calendars and dates. The package also contains the Pattern and Matcher classes for finding and extracting specified substrings from text, and the Stack and Queue classes for implementing basic concurrent algorithms.

## java.math

The java.math package contains classes for performing basic numeric operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rounding, and error detection.

## Conclusion

The Java programming language is a versatile and powerful language that is used to run on a wide range of systems and platforms. Part of the power of Java comes from the fact that it is a high-level language that can run on almost any hardware.
This means that you can write code once and run it almost anywhere. It also means that you have to be careful about how you organize your code so it can be reused.
This is where Java packages come in.
By grouping related classes and sub-packages into a single definition and name space, you can make your code easier to understand and reuse. You can also avoid naming conflicts with other libraries or programs.
