summary: ETC (ETC) is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market today,
  with a market cap of almost $6 billion. It's the world’s 14th most valuable
  digital asset, and the original Ethereum network. It is an excellent choice
  for investors who agree with the initial ETH developers’ decision to reverse
  the DAO hack. ETC supporters didn’t want to change the original blockchain
  because such an action would be a violation of blockchain principles. It
  operates on a different consensus mechanism, which is not as advanced or
  optimized.
intro: >-
  Ethereum is the world’s leading blockchain for smart contracts. It
  brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have
  imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be
  an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to
  build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such
  project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another
  version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum
  software, which was later on referred to as “ETH” when its token achieved its
  own market cap and ticker symbol. 

  Ethereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from "new" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.

## What is Ethereum Classic?

The Ethereum Classic network is a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain, which existed from July 2015 to July 2016. After a hack occurred on the Ethereum network, a majority of ETH holders decided to “hard fork” the blockchain to reverse the theft, and create a new Ethereum network. ETH holders who didn’t agree with the decision ended up with two sets of coins: the original set on the old chain, and the new set on the new chain. The old chain was then rebranded to Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market today, with a market cap of almost $6 billion. It’s the world’s 14th most valuable digital asset, and the original Ethereum network.
Ethereum Classic has the same functionality as Ethereum, but it’s code is not as advanced or optimized. It operates on a different consensus mechanism (which is explained below) and it has some bugs that were resolved in Ethereum. However, it is an excellent choice for investors who agree with the initial Ethereum developers’ decision to reverse the DAO hack.

## The DAO Incident and Aftermath

As mentioned above, the Ethereum network was compromised in June 2016 by a hacker who exploited a weakness in the DAO program. The attacker managed to steal $50 million in Ethereum, which was around $30 million at the time of the hack. After the incident, the community was divided into two camps: Those who wanted Ethereum to “hard fork” in order to undo the hack, and those who opposed the decision and wanted the blockchain to remain as it was. The latter group continued using the original Ethereum code as it was before the hack, and referred to it as Ethereum Classic.
The reason for the fork was that the stolen Ethereum couldn’t be retrieved from the hacker’s address, and would therefore be lost forever. Opponents of the fork believed that Ethereum should remain as it was and that the hacker should keep the money. They didn’t want to change the original blockchain because such an action would be a violation of blockchain principles. They wanted to maintain the original state of Ethereum and let the hacker keep the money.

## Why Was Ethereum Classic Created?

The debate between ETH and ETC supporters raged on for months. Eventually, the decision was made to activate the Ethereum network hard fork, which would allow all ETH holders to withdraw their stolen funds, plus a 25% extra. However, the hard fork also meant that the original Ethereum blockchain would be altered and the “code is law” principle would be broken. As mentioned above, ETC supporters didn’t want to change the original Ethereum blockchain. Their primary goal was to create a network that was identical to the original Ethereum, but without any possible interference from ETH.

Since the hard fork was a permanent solution, supporters of the classic chain decided to continue operating the original Ethereum network and to let the hacker keep the stolen money.

## How to Buy Ethereum Classic?

First, it’s important to note that Ethereum Classic isn’t listed on every single crypto exchange. In fact, it’s only available on a handful of trading platforms. However, you can easily buy ETC using the top 3 exchanges below. Once you’ve selected an exchange, create an account and make sure to review their trade fees, deposit and withdrawal limits, and other obligatory details. 

Before you can purchase any Ethereum Classic, you will need to buy Bitcoins or Ether first. You can do this by signing up for an account at Coinbase. Coinbase is currently the most popular and reputable place to buy ETH. Once you’ve created an account, connect your payment method (i.e. bank account or credit card) and buy as much Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) as you want. If you buy less than $100 worth of coins, you won’t pay any fees. Once you have your BTC or ETH, transfer it to one of the exchanges below and start trading.

## Pros of Ethereum Classic

- It’s the original Ethereum code without any changes.
- It operates on a different consensus mechanism, which is more decentralized than ETH.
- It has fewer bugs than ETH.
- It was created by the Ethereum developers who didn’t want to change the blockchain.

## Cons of Ethereum Classic

- It has fewer features and optimizations than ETH.
- It’s not listed on as many crypto exchanges as ETH.
- It has a smaller community and trading volume than ETH.
- It has less liquidity than ETH.

## Final Words: Should You Buy ETC?

To conclude, Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain with a different consensus mechanism. It is more decentralized, hasn’t implemented code changes, and its community is smaller than ETH. Ethereum Classic is a solid blockchain with a proven track record and has proven to be a reliable source of inspiration for other projects. If you believe in the original Ethereum developers’ decision to reverse the hack, Ethereum Classic is a good investment.
