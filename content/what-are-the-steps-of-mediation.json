Putting your dog in a boarding facility or kennel isn\\u2019t an easy decision for most pet owners, especially if you have a sensitive breed (i.e., lots of barking = unhappy dogs). So how can you get your pup ready to be on their own? It\\u2019s not as simple as locking them in a closet for a few hours once or twice and then expecting them to be cool with it. Dogs don\\u2019t think like people; they don\\u2019t understand symbolic actions like turning off the light as meaning that you won\\u2019t be coming back home tonight. They have instinctual fear responses that need to be addressed specifically with training and care before leaving them alone.'))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If left unattended, this dirt and oil will cause your dog to smell and leave them more susceptible to infections. Grooming your dog regularly can also help you identify any problems they might have with their skin or fur early on. To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every one to three months.\nThe benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence. The process is not only beneficial for the dog but also for you as an owner as it gives you time to build a stronger bond with your pet.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s a way of resolving disputes that is less adversarial than litigation and usually cheaper, faster, and more private than other methods. Mediation is also collaborative as well as neutral. The mediator acts as a neutral party who helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable manner.\nIn mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It\\u2019s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It\\u2019s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.
