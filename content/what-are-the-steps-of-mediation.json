  "summary": "The parties can discuss the issues and concerns they have with each other, and the mediator can help guide the discussion and suggest ways the two sides might be able to settle on amicable terms that are mutually beneficial. Mediation sessions usually take place in a neutral location such as a mediation center. The mediator will then work with each party to structure the mediation session(s) in a way that helps both sides work together productively to reach an agreement. At the end of the session, the parties will usually agree on a written mediation agreement that will usually help the parties work together.",
  "intro": "Mediation is a type of alternative dispute resolution that utilizes a neutral third party to help parties in a conflict reach an agreement. These agreements are known as mediation agreements, and they are not legally binding. However, if the parties choose to enter into such an agreement, it can help them move past their differences and work together constructively going forward.\nMediation is very different from other forms of ADR because there is no neutral third party adjudicator present during mediation sessions. Rather, both parties agree to let a neutral mediator facilitate their discussion and suggest ways the two sides might be able to settle on amicable terms that are mutually beneficial.\nFurthermore, unlike arbitration, which uses a third party neutral arbitrator to resolve disputes privately with no input from either party, with mediation thereâ€™s no need for secret proceedings or winner take all outcomes. Instead, both sides come together in order to find the best possible outcome for everyone involved by working through issues towards an agreeable solution that works for everyone.",
