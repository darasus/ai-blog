summary: The best programming languages for AI will depend on what type of AI
  project you want to build, but the ones highlighted above are a good place to
  start. Python, Java, C++, Go and Ruby are particularly useful for AI
  development. The flexibility of Python combined with the scalability of Java
  and the speed of C++ make them useful for artificial intelligence. Scale is a
  specific programming language created by IBM for AI. It’s designed to be used
  in large-scale projects that require a lot of scalability.
intro: >-
  Artificial Intelligence is no longer a future tech but something that has
  started disrupting various industries today. There are numerous roles, beyond
  the obvious machine learning engineers that you can specialize in to help
  bring AI projects to life. We have listed the top programming languages for AI
  below, so you can pick the right one and get started on your own AI project
  right away. 

  If you’re just getting started with coding or planning on diving into it more deeply in the future, this article will give you some insight into the different programming languages available out there. Each of these languages has certain features that make them particularly useful when creating artificial intelligence applications. Keep reading to learn more about these useful programming languages and which one suits your needs best. Read on to know more

## Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that’s been used to create all sorts of software. It’s used in a number of different industries, including artificial intelligence. There are a few reasons why Python is a good choice for AI development. One is that it’s easy to read and understand. This means that its code is easier to revise, which is important for large teams that may need to change the programming later on.

Another reason why Python is a good choice for AI development is that it’s very flexible. It can be applied to a variety of different industries thanks to its versatility. It’s also very scalable, which means that it can be applied on small and large scales, making it useful for both small businesses and large corporations. 


## Java

Java is a language that is primarily used for developing websites. However, it also has applications in artificial intelligence. Java has been used to create many intelligent applications, including voice assistants and image recognition software.
Because of its long history and large community, Java is a very reliable programming language that is well-documented and understood. It’s also very scalable, which makes it useful for large projects involving many programmers.
Unfortunately, Java isn’t as easy to read as some other programming languages. This is often cited as a disadvantage, as it can lead to more error-prone code. However, modern tools can help solve this problem.

## C++

C++ is a programming language that was designed as an extension of the original C language, which is another language used for artificial intelligence. This means that C++ is particularly useful for AI development.
C++ has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read. It has been criticized for its performance compared to other languages, such as Java, but there are ways to optimize it to make it faster.
C++ is also particularly useful for making games, which makes it useful for certain AI applications. One of the most well-known examples of a game that uses C++ for its AI is Civilization.

## Go

Go is a programming language created by Google that’s particularly useful for artificial intelligence. This is because it’s been designed to be used in large-scale projects that require a lot of scalability. This makes it particularly useful for artificial intelligence, as large-scale AI projects are often required to be scalable.
Go has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read and understand, as well as a simple and efficient runtime that makes it efficient to use.
Go is also particularly good at parallel processing, which is helpful for artificial intelligence. This is because AI algorithms often require large amounts of parallel processing. 


## Ruby

Ruby is a general-purpose programming language that has been used to create artificial intelligence, particularly for machine learning.
Because Ruby was designed to be easy to read and understand, it’s a good choice for artificial intelligence. This is particularly useful for large teams that may be working together on an AI project.
Ruby has been criticized for its performance compared to other languages, although there are ways to optimize it.

## Scale

Finally, Scale is a specific programming language created by IBM for artificial intelligence. It’s been used to create intelligent applications, particularly for image recognition.
This makes Scale particularly useful for artificial intelligence, as it was designed specifically for this purpose.
The syntax of Scale is designed to be easy to read and understand, which makes it particularly appropriate for artificial intelligence.

## Conclusion

There are numerous roles, beyond the obvious machine learning engineers that you can specialize in to help bring AI projects to life. The best programming languages for AI will depend on what type of AI project you want to build, but the ones highlighted above are a good place to start.

The flexibility of Python combined with the scalability of Java and the speed of C++, or Go, make them particularly useful for creating AI applications. Whether you’re creating an AI-powered website or working on a complex machine learning algorithm, you’ll likely be able to use one of these languages.
