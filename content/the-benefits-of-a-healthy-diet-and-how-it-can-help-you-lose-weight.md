## What Is A Healthy Diet?

A healthy diet is essentially a balanced diet that focuses on eating a variety of nutritious foods. A healthy diet can help you lose weight and reduce your risk for certain diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancers.

A healthy diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fish, and low-fat dairy products. It also includes low-sugar, low-sodium foods such as rice and beans, tofu, apples, and pears. A healthy diet also includes water, tea, and coffee without cream or sugar.

A healthy diet should also focus on eating less processed foods and more unprocessed foods. Unprocessed foods are foods that are in their natural state and haven’t been altered from their original form. Processed foods are foods that have been altered from their original state, either by changing their form, or by adding new ingredients.
