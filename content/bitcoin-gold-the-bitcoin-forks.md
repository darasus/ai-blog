summary: Bitcoin Gold, or BTG, is a new cryptocurrency derived from the original
  Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Gold was created with the goal of creating a more
  decentralized network by introducing a “proof of work change” Bitcoin Cash is
  another popular Bitcoin fork. The goal of this fork was to increase the
  scalability of the network by increasing the block size to 8 MB. Bitcoin has
  been growing in popularity over the past few years, but it has a scalability
  issue. The more data that each block can store, the more transactions the
  network can process.
intro: "You may have heard of a fork before — as in, the idea of a software
  developer making a copy or “fork” of another program’s code. In the world of
  computer programs and coding, it isn’t uncommon for someone to make a modified
  version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature
  or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in
  another programmer’s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering
  that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is:
  Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen
  when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not
  uncommon) or if there’s some other reason that makes them want to branch off
  from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there
  are many different types of forks beyond just software! In this article we
  will be exploring Bitcoin forks: More specifically, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin
  Cash."

## What is a Bitcoin Fork?

A Bitcoin fork is essentially the creation of a new cryptocurrency, derived from the original Bitcoin blockchain. A fork can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common reason is to create a new cryptocurrency that has a different mining algorithm or mining process from the original Bitcoin. Bitcoin forks are also called “hard forks”, and they are different from “software forks” in that a Bitcoin fork creates a completely new currency, while a software fork remains as a new branch of the original currency.

Hard forks are often a result of a disagreement in the community about how to best scale the cryptocurrency to meet demand and accommodate more users. Bitcoin has been growing in popularity over the past few years, but it has a scalability issue. The Bitcoin blockchain can process a limited number of transactions per second. 

## Bitcoin Gold: What is It?

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency space at all, you’ve probably heard of Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Gold, or BTG, is a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain. The goal of this fork was to create a more decentralized network by introducing what the creators call a “proof of work change”.

The idea behind this change is to make Bitcoin mining more decentralized again by making the hardware requirements for mining less demanding. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, you need specialized hardware to effectively mine coins and participate in the network.

But with the introduction of Bitcoin Gold, you can use regular computers to mine the new cryptocurrency. The goal here was to create a more distributed network, where anyone can participate and contribute to the mining process.

## How to Get Bitcoin Gold?

If you want to get some Bitcoin Gold, you’ll first need to get some Bitcoin. The best way to do this is to sign up for a free account with Coinbase. Coinbase is the most common and easiest way to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Once you have some Bitcoin in your account, you simply need to transfer it over to a cryptocurrency exchange where you can trade it for Bitcoin Gold.

Some good options for exchanges where you can trade your Bitcoin for Bitcoin Gold include Binance and Bittrex. Once your Bitcoin has been exchanged for Bitcoin Gold, you’ll be able to store it in a wallet.

## Should you invest in Bitcoin Gold?

One of the most important things to consider before you invest in any new or upcoming cryptocurrency is its value. With so many different types of cryptocurrencies out there, it’s important to understand each one and its potential.

As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Gold was created with the goal of creating a more decentralized network. But this also poses an interesting question: How does one measure decentralization?

One way to measure decentralization is by looking at the distribution of the total supply of a given cryptocurrency. The more decentralized a cryptocurrency is, the less concentrated its supply will be. In other words, the fewer hands a given cryptocurrency is in, the more decentralized it is.

## What is Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin Cash is another popular Bitcoin fork. It’s also one of the first forks of the original Bitcoin blockchain, having happened in August 2017. The goal of this fork was to increase the scalability of the network by increasing the block size to 8 MB.

For those who don’t know, the block size is the amount of data that each block on the blockchain can store. This is one factor that greatly affects how many transactions per second the blockchain can process.

## How to get Bitcoin Cash?

If you own Bitcoin, you can claim Bitcoin Cash by clicking the “Claim” button on your Coinbase account. If you own Bitcoin Cash (or any other fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain), you can use the same account to withdraw Bitcoin (or any other fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain).

Some good exchanges to use to convert your Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin include Binance and Bittrex. Once your Bitcoin Cash has been converted to Bitcoin, you can store it in a Bitcoin wallet.

## Should you invest in Bitcoin Cash?

As with any other cryptocurrency in the space, it’s important to understand what it is and what it’s trying to achieve. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, the goal is to create a more scalable network that can process more transactions per second. This is important because one of the scalability issues that Bitcoin faces is that each block can only store a certain amount of data. The more data that each block can store, the more transactions the network can process each second.

Bitcoin Cash’s solution to this is to increase the block size. This can be a risky proposition, however. The larger the block size, the more data each block can store. This can pose a security risk because it means that each block can store more data, giving hackers more space to try to hack the blockchain.

## Final Words

As you can see, there are many different types of forks beyond just software! In this article, we explored Bitcoin forks: Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash. We also talked about what a fork is, why they happen, and how to get and store these new digital currencies. When it comes to investing in new cryptocurrencies, it’s important to understand what they are, how they work, and if they have the potential to succeed.
