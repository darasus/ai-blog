Bitcoin Gold is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that occurred on October 24, 2017. The new blockchain created a new cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin Gold (BTG). BTG is different from Bitcoin (BTC) in a few key ways: first, BTG has a different proof-of-work algorithm than BTC, called Equihash. This makes BTG much more ASIC-resistant than BTC; second, BTG plans to implement a new feature called "post-quantum" signatures, which will make BTG more secure against quantum computing attacks than BTC. Finally, BTG has a different block size limit than BTC, meaning that BTG can theoretically scale better than BTC.
