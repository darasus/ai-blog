Popular restaurants like Applebee\\u2019s, Chili\\u2019s, and others serve burgers, steaks, and other typical \\u201CAmerican fare\\u201D that is packed with calories, fat, sodium, and carbs. Ordering a salad may be a healthier choice, but keep in mind that many eateries toss the lettuce with a high-calorie, high-fat salad dressing that quickly turns your otherwise healthy choice into something extremely unhealthy.\nIn this case, ordering a salad is still a better option than a burger or steak, provided you order it without the dressing and ask for olive oil and vinegar as dressing substitutes. Asian and Indian restaurants are another good option to consider, as most feature \\u201Clight\\u201D versions of traditional meals. Chinese restaurants are another good bet, as many feature dishes that are low in calories and sodium, but don\\u2019t skimp on taste.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go for protein and veggie-based dishes\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The first thing you should do is to choose a protein-based meal, such as fish, chicken, or tofu, as the primary component of your meal.

Instead, order a protein-based meal that also has a healthy side dish, such as a grilled salmon with a side of steamed broccoli. You\\u2019ll get a healthy dose of protein from the salmon and broccoli, and the broccoli will help negate some of the potential negative effects of consuming a fair amount of protein.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Check the calories in advance\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`While you\\u2019re at the restaurant, check the calories in advance to make sure that you\\u2019re not ordering a meal that would significantly exceed your daily calorie intake. Many restaurants now have their menu items listed with the number of calories for each dish, which can make the selection process much easier.\nFinding the \\u201CNutrition\\u201D or \\u201CCalories\\u201D section on the menu will greatly simplify this process. Be sure to check the serving size, too, as that may be far less than you expect. A good example of this is the serving size of rice at many Asian restaurants, which is rarely a full serving. Another potential pitfall is the number of calories in drinks, especially those that are fruity and contain a lot of sugar.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go for healthy side dishes or add-ons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`At most restaurants, you can get a side dish that comes with the meal. Many of the healthy side dishes are starchy, such as rice or a baked potato.

You may also want to ask if you can get a half-portion of the meal if you\\u2019re not overly hungry.

A good example of this is an Asian meal like shrimp lo mein or Chinese stir-fry with a side of steamed broccoli. The broccoli will provide a good dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, while the lo mein or stir-fry will be a good source of protein.\nIn addition to broccoli, you can also order a side of green beans, carrots, or any other vegetable that you enjoy and consider healthy. You can even ask if you can get a side of fruit or a small bowl of rice pudding for dessert if you feel like you need a sweet treat after your meal.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Turning baked goods into savory meals\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Many restaurants also bake fresh breads each day and serve it with their meals.

In fact, most adults spend about a third of their weeknight time on food and drink, which leaves little time for anything else.\nWe all lead busy lives with lots of obligations outside of work or school: we have friends, family members, and partners that we need to spend time with on a regular basis. It doesn\\u2019t leave much room for eating right.\nFortunately, there are lots of ways to keep your diet in check while also fitting in your hectic schedule. Keeping healthy snacks like fruits and nuts stocked at home can help you avoid getting hungry at the worst possible moment. Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day is another great approach that can help you feel fuller faster without overloading your system with calories at one sitting. Eating well when you\\u2019re busy isn\\u2019t impossible; it just takes some planning ahead.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
