Asian and Indian restaurants are another good option to consider, as most feature \\u201Clight\\u201D versions of traditional meals.

Be sure to check the serving size, too, as that may be far less than you expect. A good example of this is the serving size of rice at many Asian restaurants, which is rarely a full serving.
