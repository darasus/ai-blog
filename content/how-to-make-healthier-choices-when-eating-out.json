Ordering a salad may be a healthier choice, but keep in mind that many eateries toss the lettuce with a high-calorie, high-fat salad dressing that quickly turns your otherwise healthy choice into something extremely unhealthy.\nIn this case, ordering a salad is still a better option than a burger or steak, provided you order it without the dressing and ask for olive oil and vinegar as dressing substitutes. Asian and Indian restaurants are another good option to consider, as most feature \\u201Clight\\u201D versions of traditional meals. Chinese restaurants are another good bet, as many feature dishes that are low in calories and sodium, but don\\u2019t skimp on taste.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go for protein and veggie-based dishes\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The first thing you should do is to choose a protein-based meal, such as fish, chicken, or tofu, as the primary component of your meal.

Be sure to check the serving size, too, as that may be far less than you expect. A good example of this is the serving size of rice at many Asian restaurants, which is rarely a full serving.

The broccoli will provide a good dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, while the lo mein or stir-fry will be a good source of protein.\nIn addition to broccoli, you can also order a side of green beans, carrots, or any other vegetable that you enjoy and consider healthy.
