It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.
