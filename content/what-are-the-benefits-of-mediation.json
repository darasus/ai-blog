You just need to find the right motivation to get started and keep going.\nA lot of people give up on their New Year\\u2019s resolutions before they even begin, because they don\\u2019t have a plan of action and fail to consider what will keep them motivated along the way. Let us take a look at how you can make your resolution work:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
