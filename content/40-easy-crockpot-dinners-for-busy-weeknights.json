So how should you deal with food trends? Do we follow them? Ignore them? Or just give them a lukewarm response?\nFollow food trends if it makes sense for your business, and use them as a way to stay ahead of competitors and gain new customers. Following trends gives your business an opportunity to attract new customers by keeping your place relevant with the latest tastes and preferences. At the same time, ignoring popular foods can also be risky as that can alienate potential patrons who are looking for those options when they come to dine at your establishment.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If so, you\\u2019re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. However, not all types of fish have the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of your diet.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
