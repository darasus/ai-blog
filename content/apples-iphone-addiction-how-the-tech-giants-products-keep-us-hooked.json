When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.

While smartphone sales were initially muted due to their high cost, feature phone sales were booming.\nThat all changed in 2007, with the launch of the iPhone.
