  "summary": "The iPhone is the backbone of Appleâ€™s services business. It generates massive amounts of revenue for the company and is an essential part of its services business. The amount of money Apple makes from iPhone sales every year is so great that it actually outstrips the company's other major revenue stream. If the iPhone turns out to be a dud, Apple may have a serious problem on its hands. The company's executives have been talking up their flagship product so much that it almost seems like an unhealthy obsession.",

It was by far the most frequently discussed topic on the earnings call \\u2014 even more so than China and tariffs.\nNearly everything Apple discussed on that call revolved around iPhone: When asked about concerns over weakness in Greater China, Apple execs responded by talking about how they were bullish on iPhone sales there long term. When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.

While smartphone sales were initially muted due to their high cost, feature phone sales were booming.\nThat all changed in 2007, with the launch of the iPhone. Between 2007 and 2010, smartphone sales exploded from 9% of the market to more than 50%. Apple\\u2019s iPhone was a large part of that explosion.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"iPhone addiction isn\\u2019t new\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Even though smartphone usage was exploding, it was all too easy to dismiss addiction to the device itself as a fad. After all, it was a device that many people had just recently acquired access to, and it took some time for the average user to fully explore the capabilities of a smartphone.\nThat said, there were some early signs of addiction to mobile devices, especially smartphones. For example, in a study published in 2010, 15% of respondents reported feeling \\u201Caddicted\\u201D to their mobile phones.
