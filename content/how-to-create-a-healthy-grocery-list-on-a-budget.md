intro: >-
  When you’re on a tight budget, it can feel like hitting up the grocery
  store is one of the last things you can afford to do. However, there are ways
  to make your food dollars go further and still eat well. 

  Instead of making weekly trips to multiple stores and markets, plan a shopping day and hit one store at a time. Look for sales in that store before you go and stock up on foods that are good value. You might even consider investing in a membership card or becoming an insider or club member so you get vouchers or other discounts. Adding your own spin on some classic cheap meals will also help you save money without sacrificing nutrition. It just takes some planning and research to make it work!

## Build a Basic Food Item Grocery List

The first step to creating a healthy grocery list is knowing what your family will eat. You don’t have to have every meal planned out. But having a general idea of the food types you’re likely to eat is important.

If you are cooking for vegetarians or vegans, add those items to your list first. Once you know which foods are staples in your diet, you can start to shop for them.

One of the best ways to create a healthy grocery list is to visit the produce section first and then work your way through the store. You can add fresh fruits and vegetables to your list.

Whole grains (such as brown rice, quinoa and oats) are also important to add to your list. Beans and legumes are also healthy and cheap protein sources that can be used in many meals.

## Beans and Legumes

Beans and legumes are an excellent source of fiber and protein. They are also very inexpensive. You can use them in many different meals, so they will last a long time.

You can add beans to salads, soups and tacos. They also make a great addition to baked goods and can be used as a meat replacement. Legumes have a mild flavour, so they can also be used as a side dish.

First, you will need to soak dried beans overnight to make them easier to cook. You can either cook them in water or add them to soups and stews.

You can also use canned beans, which are very convenient and easy to add to meals. However, you should be careful not to eat too many canned foods.

## Whole Grains

Whole grains are rich in fiber and B vitamins. They also contain resistant starch, which may have health benefits. There are many different types of whole grains you can add to your diet, including quinoa, amaranth, barley and oats.

You can use these grains in many different meals and in desserts. They also make a great addition to salads. Brown rice is the most common type of whole grain. Whole grain bread and pasta are also good choices.

You can add whole grains to almost any meal. They are a good base for soups and stews and can be added to baked goods. Whole grains are a healthy alternative to refined grains.

## Eggs and Dairy

Eggs and dairy are good protein sources and are also healthy fats. Eggs are inexpensive, easy to cook and go well in many different meals. Dairy is also a good source of protein.

You can use eggs in many different meals, including omelettes, sandwiches and salads. You can also use them in desserts. You can add dairy to many different meals as well.

If you are buying organic eggs and dairy products, they will be more expensive. You should also avoid eating too much cholesterol as it can increase your risk of heart disease.

## Healthy Fats

Healthy fats are important to your diet, but you should limit the amount of saturated fats you eat. Healthy fats include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.

Healthy fats are important because they help your body process certain vitamins and they boost your metabolism. This means you will burn more calories.

Butter, margarine, lard, coconut oil and olive oil are examples of good fats. You can add them to many different meals, including salads and baked goods. However, you should avoid eating too many calories from saturated fats.

## Vegetables

Vegetables are an important food group that most people don’t eat enough of. They are high in fiber and vitamins and minerals.

You don’t have to eat a salad every day to get enough vegetables into your diet. You can add them to soups and stews, include them in baked goods and use them as a side dish. You can also use vegetables in desserts.

You can eat vegetables raw, steamed or baked. You can also use them in a smoothie or juice. Vegetables are a healthy addition to any meal and they are inexpensive.

## Fruit

Fruit is rich in vitamins and minerals and is also good for your digestive system. You should eat two to four servings of fruit per day.

You can add fruit to breakfasts, desserts and salads. You can also bake or broil fruit and use it as a side dish. Apples and pears are the cheapest fruits and make good additions to salads.

Fruits are healthy, but they also contain sugar and calories. You should include them in your diet, but eat them in moderation.

## Staples

Some staples are good to have in your home at all times, such as dried legumes, pasta and canned tuna. You can also add rice and beans to this list.

Rice and dried legumes are cheap sources of protein that are easy to cook. Canned tuna is a good source of protein and is a cheap way to get your daily recommended amount of fish.

You can also add nuts, seeds and nut butters to your list, as well as canned vegetables. You should keep different staples in your cupboard and fridge so you can easily make meals from scratch.

## Conclusion

Food is a fundamental part of life. It is what fuels our bodies and provides us with the necessary vitamins and minerals to thrive. It is important to eat various foods from all different categories to ensure that you are receiving the proper nutrients. Having a healthy grocery list is the first step to eating well. It is important that you select the right foods for optimal health. Choosing healthy foods can be challenging, but it is important to remember that variety is key.
