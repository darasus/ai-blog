It\\u2019s used to catalyse the fermentation process when baking sourdough bread, giving it a distinct sour flavour. Traditionally, starter takes weeks to make, but there are much faster methods using packaged yeast \\u2013 see below. However you choose to make your own starter, the process is relatively straightforward and once you get the hang of it, an easy routine to keep up.\nSourdough has numerous benefits over other kinds of bread. It is easier for your body to digest than white bread because it doesn\\u2019t have any gluten in it (gluten can be challenging for people with a sensitivity or intolerance). Sourdough doesn\\u2019t have any added sugars either; just natural sugars from the fermentation process. It also has more protein than standard breads, which means it keeps you feeling fuller for longer.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
