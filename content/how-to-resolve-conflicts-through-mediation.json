Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven\\u2019t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In this blog, we will explore what mediation is and why it works. If you are currently embroiled in a conflict or anticipate that one may arise, you may find the ideas in this blog article helpful.\nMediation is an excellent technique for ending disputes between friends, colleagues, family members or any party involved in a conflict. It involves bringing neutral third-party mediators into the conflict and having them help both sides understand and work through their issues so they can resolve the problems on their own from there moving forward.\nKeep reading to learn more about mediation and why it works so well for resolving conflicts.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
