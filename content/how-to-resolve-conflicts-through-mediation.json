  "summary": "Mediation is a collaborative process where a neutral third party helps two disputants (or opposing parties) reach a mutually agreeable solution to their conflict. Mediation isn’t suitable for every situation, so make sure that mediation is an option in the situation you’re dealing with. The mediator’s role is to guide the conversation and help both parties stay on track and understand each other's point of view, so they can agree on a solution that works for both sides.
