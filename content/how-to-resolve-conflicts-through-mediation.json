Maybe you\\u2019ve just moved to a new home and your dog hasn\\u2019t gotten used to the new smells yet, or maybe he has medical issues that are causing him to have accidents. Whatever the reason, if your dog is having accidents in the house it can be distressing for both of you. However, with time and patience you can help your dog learn again how to toilet outside.\nThere are various reasons why a dog may stop using the indoor toilet. It may be as simple as them not liking it because of its location or smell or because there\\u2019s another person or animal living in the house now who they don\\u2019t like seeing when they do their business.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If not, are you looking for a way to improve? Coming when called is an essential command that most pet owners neglect. When your dog comes when called, it means he will come back to you right away and not run away or chase something else. This will help keep your dog safe, especially if he\\u2019s prone to running away or chasing objects or other animals. It also helps with training and makes everyday interactions much easier than having to constantly chase after your pet.\nBut perhaps the most important reason why you should train your dog to come when called is because it might just save his life one day. In many cases, dogs that run away don\\u2019t get lost, they are just trying to find a way back home. Therefore, knowing how to train your dog to come when called can be the difference between him coming home safe and sound or getting lost forever.
