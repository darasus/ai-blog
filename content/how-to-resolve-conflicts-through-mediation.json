  "summary": "Mediation is a collaborative process where a neutral third party helps two disputants (or opposing parties) reach a mutually agreeable solution to their conflict. Mediation isn’t suitable for every situation, so make sure that mediation is an option in the situation you’re dealing with. The mediator’s role is to guide the conversation and help both parties stay on track and understand each other's point of view, so they can agree on a solution that works for both sides. The right environment can make a big difference in terms of how productive mediation is.",
  "intro": "Mediation is a process in which an impartial third party helps two people resolve their differences and reach an equitable solution to their conflict. The mediator doesn’t take sides, but instead helps both parties understand each other’s point of view. This way, the disputants can agree on a fair outcome and put an end to their disagreements.\nIf you are part of an organization that is going through a lot of conflict right now (or any time soon), mediation might be a good solution for reducing tensions, smoothing things over and getting everyone back on track. Here we’ll explain what mediation is, why it works so well for resolving conflicts and how you can initiate it in your organization.",
  "content": "## What is Mediation?\n\nMediation is a process where a neutral third party helps two disputants (or opposing parties) reach a mutually agreeable solution to their conflict. In mediation the mediator doesn’t take sides, but acts as a facilitator, guiding both parties through the process of understanding each other’s point of view, so they can agree on a solution.\n\nMediation is different from arbitration and negotiation in that it’s a collaborative process: disputants come to the table with their own ideas about what should happen and work together to reach a solution that both can agree on. In arbitration, disputants negotiate but their ideas are then weighed against an arbitrator’s decision. In negotiation, disputants start with a goal in mind and see if the other party can meet them at that point.\n\n## Why is Mediation effective for resolving conflicts?\n\nUnlike arbitration, mediation is a collaborative process and focuses more on relationship-building than proving who’s right and who’s wrong. When disputants work together to resolve their conflict, they are more likely to feel satisfied with the outcome, which is less likely to happen when one party “wins” and the other “loses”.\n\nThe disputants also get to see each other’s point of view, which, in turn, can help prevent future conflicts by creating a better understanding of the other party’s needs and concerns. Mediation can also help both parties avoid the stress and expense of going through a lengthy legal process.\n\n## How to start a mediation process?\n\nIf you’re wondering if mediation is for your organization and whether you should suggest it, here are some questions you can ask yourself to get a better idea:\n\n- Is there a high level of conflict going on? If so, what’s the cause?\n\n- Are the current conversations about the disagreement constructive or destructive?\n\n- What would happen if the conversation continued on the same path?\n\n- Is there a solution that would satisfy both parties?\n\nIf you can answer “yes” to these questions, mediation might be the solution you’re looking for! Here are some tips to help you get started.\n\nBefore you approach the disputants and suggest mediation as a solution, make sure to do your research and understand the benefits of mediation. Also make sure that mediation is an option in the situation you’re dealing with. Mediation isn’t suitable for every situation, so make sure it’s an option before you approach the disputants.\n\n## 3 Steps for Resolving Conflicts Through Mediation\n\nWe’ve talked about how mediation works and how it can help resolve conflicts, but here are the 3 key steps to actually doing mediation:\n\n- Before you begin - Before you start the mediation process, have a clear goal in mind. Make sure both parties are on the same page with regards to what the final outcome should be.\n\n- Set the stage for success - Choose a space that is comfortable and inspiring for everyone involved. Having the right environment can make a big difference in terms of how productive the mediation is.\n\n- Engage in dialogue - This is the core of mediation: getting disputants to talk to each other. The mediator’s role is to guide the conversation and help both parties stay on track and understand each other’s point of view.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMediation is a proven way to help two parties resolve a conflict. It allows them to explore the issue from different perspectives and come up with a solution that works for both sides.\n\nWhile most people think of mediation as a tool for resolving disputes, it can also be used for a variety of other situations, such as for settling landlord-tenant disputes, making decisions about child custody or creating an equitable solution when managing a disagreement between members of a group.\n\nAlthough mediation can be a helpful tool, it’s important to understand that there’s no guarantee both parties will actually agree on a solution. If one party isn’t interested in mediation, the other party may have to pursue legal action."
