There\\u2019s also True Tone technology for a more natural viewing experience, advanced speakers, a dynamic microphone and an upgraded fifth-generation Butterfly keyboard.\nBut many users were disappointed to learn that Apple has ditched standard USB ports for USB-C \\u2013 meaning you'll need adapters for most existing devices and accessories. And the price tag is hefty as well \\u2013 starting at $1,799 for the base variant of the 13-inch model with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage (and going up to $3199 for the top version).\nSo if you\\u2019re on a budget but want something better than basic Chromebooks or Windows machines, here are our picks for The Top 12 Amazingly Low-Cost MacBook Pro Alternatives in 2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It was by far the most frequently discussed topic on the earnings call \\u2014 even more so than China and tariffs.\nNearly everything Apple discussed on that call revolved around iPhone: When asked about concerns over weakness in Greater China, Apple execs responded by talking about how they were bullish on iPhone sales there long term. When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.
