  "summary": "Apple's Airpods are the best Apple product ever made. They are easy to use, convenient and so fashionable that people canâ€™t imagine living without them anymore. The company has built an ecosystem around its products, making it easy to interconnect and work with each other. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have wireless charging, but Apple has fallen behind in terms of wireless functionality, so it needs to catch up on this growing market. At $159, the AirPods are not exactly cheap, but the high price is expected because Apple prices its products higher than its competitors.",
