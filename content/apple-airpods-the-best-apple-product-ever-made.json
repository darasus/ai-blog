Let\\u2019s be honest: When was the last time you used an Apple device to learn about the company itself? Probably never. The tricky thing about having so many devices from one company is that it can be hard to find information that applies directly to each device as an individual unit. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve compiled this guide - to show you how to make the most of your Apple device by accessing its hidden features, customizing it to fit your needs, and keeping track of everything important in one place.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Everything has been made easier thanks to technology. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that enables devices or algorithms to act in a human-like manner as observed in humans and animals.\nAI has many practical applications, such as automatically tagging images on social media sites, detecting spam email filters, or self-driving cars.
