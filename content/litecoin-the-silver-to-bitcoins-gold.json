The mining difficulty is an algorithm that determines how much effort is required to find a new block. Mining difficulty is adjusted by the network to keep mining new blocks consistent. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty is very high, making it difficult to mine new blocks. This means that it can take days to confirm a transaction. With Litecoin, the mining difficulty is much lower, meaning transactions are confirmed much faster.\nWhile the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, the supply of Litecoin is much higher at 84 million coins.

Think about how Litecoin could be used in the future and how that might affect its price.\nLitecoin has many advantages over Bitcoin including lower mining costs and transaction times.
