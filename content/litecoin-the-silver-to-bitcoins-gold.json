The mining difficulty is an algorithm that determines how much effort is required to find a new block. Mining difficulty is adjusted by the network to keep mining new blocks consistent. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty is very high, making it difficult to mine new blocks. This means that it can take days to confirm a transaction. With Litecoin, the mining difficulty is much lower, meaning transactions are confirmed much faster.\nWhile the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, the supply of Litecoin is much higher at 84 million coins.

This group believes that Bitcoin should be used as a long-term investment and should be treated as a store of value. They also believe that Bitcoin should be mined using expensive hardware in order to make it difficult to attain.\nOthers believe that Bitcoin should be used as a digital cash system. This group believes that Bitcoin should be used for daily transactions and should be cheap enough to be used by the average person.\nThe creators of Litecoin believe that Bitcoin should be treated like digital cash.

LoafWallet is a mobile Litecoin wallet created by the Litecoin Foundation. LoAF is a great wallet for both beginners and experienced cryptocurrency traders.\nIf you\\u2019d prefer a more secure option, you can store your Litecoin in a hardware wallet like the Trezor.

Think about how Litecoin could be used in the future and how that might affect its price.\nLitecoin has many advantages over Bitcoin including lower mining costs and transaction times.

This is unfortunate, because Litecoin offers a faster and cheaper way to transact that could one day challenge the status of fiat currencies like the dollar.\nIf you\\u2019re interested in investing in Litecoin, be sure to keep up to date with the latest news and developments.

If you\\u2019re currently working on your own business or startup idea, you might be wondering if blockchain is something you should aim to implement in your company.\nDo you need a complex network of nodes and miners to verify transactions? How about consortiums of pre-approved users who can access different levels of information based on their membership? Are you trying to avoid a third party intermediary like banks or brokers?
