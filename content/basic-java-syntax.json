Java is one of the most popular choices for beginners to learn. - Syntax - Syntax refers to the rules that dictate how a specific programming language should be written. It\\u2019s important to understand the syntax for any programming language you want to write in. This ensures that your code is written in the right way. - Byte- The smallest unit of data in a computer is called a byte. It\\u2019s often compared to the size of a letter in an alphabet.

These are words that can\\u2019t be used as normal words in your code. Instead, you need to use their specific symbols. This is so that the computer will know what you are trying to do.
