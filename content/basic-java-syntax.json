They use programming languages to instruct computers to perform certain tasks. A programmer is also known as a coder. - Programming language - A programming language is a set of symbols and rules that programmers use to write instructions. These instructions tell computers what to do. There are thousands of different programming languages. Java is one of the most popular choices for beginners to learn. - Syntax - Syntax refers to the rules that dictate how a specific programming language should be written. It\\u2019s important to understand the syntax for any programming language you want to write in. This ensures that your code is written in the right way. - Byte- The smallest unit of data in a computer is called a byte. It\\u2019s often compared to the size of a letter in an alphabet. A letter in an alphabet can be any one of 26 letters, while a byte can be any one of 256 different combinations.\")),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Keywords\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Keywords are special words in a programming language that have specific meanings, and can\\u2019t be used as normal words in your code. This is because they have specific functions that they need to perform. In Java, there are seven categories of keywords: data type, method, variable, exception, loop, try/catch/finally, and class. These are words that can\\u2019t be used as normal words in your code. Instead, you need to use their specific symbols. This is so that the computer will know what you are trying to do. It\\u2019s also a way to ensure that your code is consistent. If you use the keywords correctly, your code will be consistent with other Java programs.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Variables and data types\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A variable is a piece of data that is stored in your computer\\u2019s memory. It can be changed, depending on the situation. A variable can be a single piece of information, such as an employee\\u2019s name, or multiple pieces of information, such as an employee\\u2019s name, salary, and job title. Java uses variables to represent different types of information. The type of data that variables can be assigned is called a data type. The most common data types in Java include the following: - String \\u2013 A string is a collection of characters. - Integer \\u2013 An integer is a whole number without a decimal place. - Boolean \\u2013 A boolean is either true or false. - Float \\u2013 A float is a number with a decimal place. - Double \\u2013 A double is a number with a decimal place. - Array \\u2013 An array is a collection of data. - Long \\u2013 A long is a big number.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conditional Statements\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A conditional statement is a type of code that tells a computer to do something based on a condition. Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming. In Java, conditional statements are written with if, else, while, and switch keywords. The if keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has a single outcome. The else keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has two outcomes. The while keyword is used to write a conditional statement that is repeated. The switch keyword is used to write a conditional statement with multiple outcomes.

If you want to write code that runs if a condition is met and code that runs if the condition isn\\u2019t met, you need to use an if statement and an else statement. - The while keyword is used to write a conditional statement that is repeated.

From there, it\\u2019s just a matter of practice and repetition until you start to feel more comfortable with the process of writing code. There\\u2019s a lot to keep track of and remember when learning to code.
