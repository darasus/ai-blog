Self-care is important for our physical and mental health, but it can be hard to find time for it when we're busy. Here are some tips for making time for self-care: 

1. Schedule it in: Make time for self-care just like you would any other appointment. Put it in your calendar and make it a priority.

2. Find a time that works for you: Some people prefer to do self-care in the morning, while others find it more relaxing at night. Find a time that works for you and stick to it.

3. Keep it simple: You don't need to spend hours on self-care. Just a few minutes each day can make a big difference. Choose activities that you enjoy and make them part of your routine.

4. Make it a habit: The more you do self-care, the easier it will become. Once it becomes a habit, you'll find it easier to make time for it.

5. Ask for help: If you're struggling to find time for self-care, ask for help from friends or family. They can watch your kids, do some chores, or just give you some time to yourself.
