## Start your day with self-care

The best way to start your day with self-care is to set the tone for it. In the same way that you would set alarms on your phone to remind you to take your medication, you can set alarms to remind yourself to practice self-care.

When you set alarms to remind yourself to practice self-care, it makes it easier to integrate self-care into your life, as you're essentially making it a priority. Whether it’s as simple as taking a few minutes to meditate or drinking a glass of water before you rush out the door in the morning, doing something to start your day with self-care can greatly benefit you for the rest of the day.

## Morning self-care habits

As the day progresses and the morning rush hour comes to an end, you may find yourself with a little bit more time on your hands. If that’s the case, you can shift your focus to a few self-care habits that may require a bit more time than you might have in the morning.

- Journaling is a great way to get your thoughts and emotions out of your head and onto paper. Journaling can be a helpful tool in self-reflection and self-exploration, and it can be a great way to start your day with self-care.

- Meditation is another popular way to start your day with self-care. Whether you go for a guided meditation or you practice mindfulness, spending some time to quiet your mind can have lasting benefits throughout the rest of the day.

- Exercise is another great way to start your day with self-care. While you may not have a ton of time to go for a full workout, you can still incorporate some physical activity into your morning routine.

## Schedule self-care activities

It can be helpful to schedule self-care activities, even when you don’t have time to do them during your day-to-day. For example, if you know that you’re going to have a particularly busy week or you’re going through a particularly stressful time, you can schedule self-care activities to help you get through it.

You can schedule self-care activities in a couple of ways: You can set a reminder on your phone, or you can create a calendar event for it. Whether you schedule one self-care event or you schedule a whole week’s worth, the important thing is to make sure that you have those times to yourself on your calendar – and that you don’t let anything interfere with them.

## Find small windows of time

It can be easy to overthink the fact that you don’t have long chunks of time to devote to self-care. While it’s ideal to set aside long periods of time for self-care, it’s not always realistic to expect that you’ll be able to do that.
If you find yourself in a situation where you don’t have long chunks of time to devote to self-care, don’t get discouraged – find ways to make small windows of time work for you.

- One way to do this is to make a list of your self-care activities and find ways to fit them into your day. For example, if you know that journaling is something you want to do for self-care, try to find ways to fit that into your day. If you have a job, you can try journaling during your lunch break. If you have kids, you can try journaling while they’re taking a nap.

- Another way to make small windows of time work for you is to establish a self-care routine.

## Take care of your physical and mental health

When it comes to self-care, it’s not just about doing things that make you feel good. It’s also about taking care of your physical and mental health. 
There are a lot of ways you can take care of your physical health, but one of the most important things you can do is to make sure that you’re getting enough sleep.

It’s estimated that around 70 million Americans suffer from sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is linked to a number of different health issues and can greatly impact your ability to function throughout the day. If you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re putting yourself at risk for everything from health problems to certain mental health conditions. Getting at least seven hours of sleep every night can greatly impact your physical health and make it easier for you to handle any challenges that come your way.
