However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding.

You will have to face challenges and difficulties in your work almost every day. In order to overcome these challenges, you need to consistently find ways to improve your coding efficiency and speed.\nWorking efficiently as a software engineer is challenging for most people. Most developers have so many different things on their minds at any given time that it can be hard to keep track of everything simultaneously. As a result, most coders perform slowly because they are thinking too much about what they\\u2019re doing rather than just doing it. However, with practice and dedication, you can learn how to code faster.\nBelow, we will walk you through some tips that will help you become more productive with your coding and accelerate your workflow significantly.

An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so.
