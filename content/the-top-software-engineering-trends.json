  "intro": "Software engineers are tasked with finding solutions to complex problems every day. The software industry is constantly evolving, and engineers must stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in order to keep their skills current and relevant.\nSoftware engineers should expect to see an influx of new software engineering trends in the coming year. Engineers need to be ready to adapt their skills and master new techniques as the world of software continues to rapidly change. As technology moves forward at a rapid pace, it’s important for engineers to be self-aware, constantly learning about new ways of doing things so that they can continue providing value through their work. \nHere are some hot software engineering trends you need to know in 2019 and beyond. Read on, and get ready for a future filled with opportunities for those who can keep up with these changes.",
  "content": "## Big Data and Machine Learning\n\nBig data and machine learning are two concepts that are strongly intertwined. Machine learning is the process of training an algorithm to recognize patterns in data by feeding it that data. This is done by setting certain parameters and letting the software run through millions of calculations while analyzing data. This allows it to create a model that can be used to predict the likelihood of something happening given other factors.\n\nBig data is a term used to describe the large quantities of data that are being collected on a global scale by enterprises. Data analytics tools are used to derive insights from large sets of data. Using these tools, organizations can better understand their customers and optimize their business operations.\n\n## Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain is a distributed ledger that is open to the public and allows users to track the transfer of assets. It was originally developed for the cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum, but its use has expanded into many other industries. The blockchain is now being used to secure data, track shipments, and even verify identity. With the rising demand for blockchain engineers, it’s important for software engineers to understand the basics of blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain engineers are responsible for developing new applications and products that use blockchain technology. They work with software engineers to integrate blockchain solutions into existing systems. As a blockchain engineer, you’ll be tasked with creating blockchain architectures, developing applications, and building out new solutions. You’ll also work with stakeholders to understand their business problems and create blockchain-based solutions that solve those issues.\n\n## Cloud Migration\n\nCloud migration is the process of migrating software and data from an on-premise data center to a remote data center environment operated by a cloud service provider. Cloud migration has been a growing trend in the software industry for years. However, 2019 is expected to see an increase in businesses migrating their systems to the cloud. A recent survey found that two-thirds of IT decision makers plan to increase their spending on cloud migration in 2019. This increase in cloud migration has created demand for cloud engineers who specialize in architecting and migrating systems.\n\nCloud engineers are responsible for migrating companies from an on-premise infrastructure to a cloud environment. This includes setting up cloud servers and migrating all data to those new servers. Cloud engineers work with stakeholders and other engineering teams to understand their needs and create a plan for migrating their systems to the cloud.\n\n## Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices that have computer software embedded in them. IoT devices are connected to the internet and can send and receive data. As these devices become more popular and widely used, they create data that must be collected and analyzed by engineers. A common example of an IoT device is a wearable health monitor that tracks your heart rate and other health-related metrics.\n\nAs IoT devices continue to grow in popularity, there will be an increased demand for engineers who specialize in IoT and data architecture. Engineers who work with IoT devices and data architecture specialize in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. This includes setting up sensors and data collection tools to monitor IoT devices and create a centralized database where data can be stored.\n\n## Advanced AI Usage in Software Development\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become a standard tool for software engineers. However, it’s important to note that there is a difference between basic AI and advanced AI. Basic AI is a computer system that is designed to think like a human. It uses data and algorithms to solve problems in a way that resembles human thinking. However, advanced AI goes beyond basic AI by giving computer systems the ability to autonomously learn new tasks and make their own decisions. This gives AI systems the ability to adapt to changing environments and take new data into consideration when making decisions. Advanced AI is being used in many industries, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.\n\nAs we move forward, there will be an increased need for engineers who specialize in advanced AI. Engineers who use advanced AI are tasked with creating new AI models and designing the system architecture that supports these models. They also work with stakeholders to understand their business problems and create solutions that use advanced AI to solve those issues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe software industry is always changing, and engineers must be prepared to adapt to new trends and technologies as they arise. Engineers who keep their skills up-to-date will be better prepared for the future and can expect to see increased job opportunities and higher salaries as a result. If you’re a software engineer, it’s important to stay on top of these hot trends so you can be ready to try new things and keep your skills competitive in the marketplace."
