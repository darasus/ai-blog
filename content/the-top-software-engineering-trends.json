In fact, it\\u2019s one of the most difficult tech fields to get started in as a beginner. But it\\u2019s also one of the most lucrative careers you can choose to pursue. The average software engineer salary is around $100K per year, which is even more impressive when you consider that the average age of software engineers is only 29! If you want to start a new career in coding but feel like you\\u2019re starting at square one, we have some advice for you. As someone who has been coding for over 10 years now, I can tell you with complete certainty that great coders are made and not born. Anyone can learn how to code if they are willing to work hard at it and adopt some good habits along the way.

However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions.
