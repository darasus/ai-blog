Machine learning is the process of training an algorithm to recognize patterns in data by feeding it that data.

However, it\\u2019s important to note that there is a difference between basic AI and advanced AI. Basic AI is a computer system that is designed to think like a human. It uses data and algorithms to solve problems in a way that resembles human thinking. However, advanced AI goes beyond basic AI by giving computer systems the ability to autonomously learn new tasks and make their own decisions.
