  "summary": "The happiest relationships are the ones where both people give each other enough space to be themselves. Relationships often work best when they’re a mix of two lives coming together. Open and honest communication is a crucial part of any successful relationship. If you’ve been able to tackle difficult conversations and come out stronger as a result, it’s a good sign that you're on the right track. If your partner is your biggest cheerleader and has your back through thick and thin, it doesn’t just support you. In a healthy relationship, both partners are there for each other, supporting each other through the good times and the bad.",
