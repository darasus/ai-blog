  "summary": "The happiest relationships are the ones where both people give each other enough space to be themselves. Relationships often work best when they’re a mix of two lives coming together. Open and honest communication is a crucial part of any successful relationship. If you’ve been able to tackle difficult conversations and come out stronger as a result, it’s a good sign that you're on the right track. If your partner is your biggest cheerleader and has your back through thick and thin, it doesn’t just support you. In a healthy relationship, both partners are there for each other, supporting each other through the good times and the bad.",
  "intro": "There are so many first date horror stories out there — awkward silences, strange amateur- magician tricks, and cringe-worthy pick-up lines being just a few of them. But getting past these awkward initial stages and finding a potential partner who you can connect with on a deeper level is no mean feat. Figuring out if someone is your soulmate or simply the first step to becoming one isn’t easy. Even though it can feel like we’re constantly being bombarded with images of fairy tale love and meet-cute romances, dating in real life isn’t always so straightforward. Unless you’re living under a rock, you probably know that letting somebody into your private world isn’t something to take lightly. \nBut how do you know if you’re on the right track when it comes to dating? Whether you’ve just met someone new and want to get to know them better without rushing things or have been seeing somebody for some time and are wondering if they could be The One, here are some signs that could indicate that this person may be more than just a casual partner…",
  "content": "## You feel happy and comfortable when you’re together.\n\nThe happiest relationships are the ones where both people give each other enough space to be themselves. They’re not constantly clinging to each other or trying to dictate each other’s actions. If you both feel happy and comfortable when you’re together, then it’s a good indication that you’re on the right track. If, on the other hand, you feel as though you have to be constantly on your best behavior, or you’re always feeling as though the other person is trying to get too close for comfort, then you don’t have the right formula for success. Finding somebody who respects you for who you really are and vice versa is, after all, one of the most important things you can look for when dating.\n\n## You have similar core values.\n\nThe person you end up dating could become your future partner, your best friend and your lover all rolled into one. But, if you have completely different values, it’s unlikely that you’ll feel as though you’re on the right track. If, however, you have similar core values, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. Relationships often work best when they’re a mix of two lives coming together. It’s not as though you’re each trying to change the other person, but you do have to understand each other’s views on certain core issues and have similar ways of dealing with them. If you’re both on the same page when it comes to values, values that encourage each of you to be the best versions of yourselves and support each other through the highs and lows of life, you’re on the right track.\n\n## You’ve been able to tackle difficult conversations and come out stronger as a result.\n\nWhen we’re seeing somebody new, it’s crucial to find ways to communicate and engage with each other that don’t trigger us or make us feel as though we’re walking on eggshells. If you’ve been able to have a difficult conversation with your partner and come out stronger as a result, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. You might not get everything right the first time, but open and honest communication is a crucial part of any successful relationship. If you’ve been able to talk about what each of you want from the relationship, any issues you’ve faced, and how you’re both feeling now, then it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. Any relationship will face difficult times, but if you’ve been able to deal with them maturely and learn from the experience, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track.\n\n## He/she makes you feel more confident about yourself.\n\nOne of the signs that you’re on the right track with your partner is if he or she makes you feel more confident about yourself. If you’ve been on a couple of dates with someone and you’re feeling more confident about yourself as a person, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. This person has a positive impact on you and makes you feel more connected to yourself. If, on the other hand, you’re still struggling to feel comfortable in your own skin, or you feel as though you’re faking it until you make it, then you’re not on the right track yet. It’s important to feel at ease with yourself when you’re dating someone. You don’t want to feel as though you’re playing a part or trying to be somebody you’re not. If you’re dating somebody who makes you feel more confident about yourself, you’re on the right track.\n\n## He/she is your biggest cheerleader.\n\nIf your partner is your biggest cheerleader and has your back through thick and thin, that’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. If, on the other hand, they’re constantly putting you down or telling you what you’re doing wrong, it doesn’t look good. In a healthy relationship, both partners are there for each other, lifting each other up and supporting each other through both the good times and the bad. If your partner is there for you when you need them, but also encourages you to follow your dreams, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. This person doesn’t just support you when it’s convenient for them. They’re there for you through thick and thin and have your best interests at heart. If he or she truly is your biggest cheerleader, you’re on the right track.\n\n## The thought of being without him/her doesn’t sound very appealing.\n\nIf the thought of being without your partner doesn’t sound very appealing, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. If, on the other hand, you feel as though you’d be able to shrug the relationship off and move on, then you’re not on the right track yet. Finding somebody who makes you want to be with them, who you feel comfortable being yourself around and who makes you want to commit to a relationship with them is a good sign that you’re on the right track. It’s normal to feel sad when a relationship ends, but if you’re dreading the thought of being without this person, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. This person is the right person for you and you for them. You should enjoy being around them, and you should feel like you’re a better person when you’re with them.\n\n## The relationship is built on trust and commitment.\n\nIf you’re dating somebody and the relationship is built on trust and commitment, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track. Relationships need time to grow and develop, and, while you might be able to spot the signs that you’re on the right track, they might not be easy to see or notice at first. If, on the other hand, you’re constantly feeling as though you’re rushing into things or that the relationship has no real foundation, you’re probably not on the right track yet. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new relationship, but you have to make sure that you’re not rushing into things and making decisions that could have long-term repercussions on both your life and your relationship. If you’ve been dating somebody for a while and you feel as though the relationship is built on trust and commitment, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track."
