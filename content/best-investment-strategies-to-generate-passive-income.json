These are known as \"loads\" because they reduce your return. A no-load fund has no upfront or hidden costs. These mutual funds have a small initial investment requirement, which may be as little as $50.\nThese funds have other characteristics that make them different from those with load fees: No-load mutual funds generally don\\u2019t charge commissions or sales fees. They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public. There are no broker incentives like sales targets or bonus payments for selling certain shares.\nKeep reading to learn more about no-load mutual funds and whether they might be right for you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
