Residual income could come from co-owning a website that gets paid per click or writing a book and earning royalties from each sale.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Current income: This is money that you earn while actively engaged in the work needed to make that money. Current income includes things like renting a spare room on Airbnb and driving for Uber.\")),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a type of passive investment that pools capital from investors to purchase real estate assets. REITs are managed by a team of professional real estate investors. They pick specific properties based on the cash flow expected from those properties. REITs typically have high initial liquidity and low management fees, making them an attractive option for investors looking to generate rental cash flow and earn passive income, though it\\u2019s important to do your research before investing in any REIT.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"REITs are governed by the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Act of 1986. This act requires that 95% of the trust\\u2019s income be distributed as dividends to shareholders at least once per year. The majority of REITs operate as publicly traded entities and can be purchased through an investment broker.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"REITs are a relatively safe investment, but there are a few things to keep in mind before diving in. First, the yield you receive on your investment will depend on the performance of the underlying real estate. Second, REITs are highly sensitive to rising interest rates. When interest rates rise, the value of all types of real estate falls. Third, REITs are highly illiquid. This means you\\u2019ll have to wait until the trust\\u2019s term ends before you can sell your investment and cash out.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Equity Investment\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"An equity investment is the purchase of a portion of a company\\u2019s stock.

Hedge funds are high-risk investments that come with high fees, but also promise high returns. Hedge fund investment strategies can vary widely, but most hedge funds are actively managed by a team of investment experts. It\\u2019s important to note that hedge funds aren\\u2019t regulated like other investment funds, so investors don\\u2019t have the same protections or fiduciary responsibilities that they would with other funds.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before investing in a hedge fund, it\\u2019s important to make sure the fund is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

They\\u2019re generally low-risk investments, but they don\\u2019t offer the same high returns that stocks do. A bond is essentially an IOU: when you buy a bond, you\\u2019re lending money to the issuer. In return, you earn a fixed interest rate until the bond matures. There are several types of bonds, including government, corporate, municipal, and high-yield bonds.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Government bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government.
