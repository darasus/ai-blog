REITs are managed by a team of professional real estate investors. They pick specific properties based on the cash flow expected from those properties.

This act requires that 95% of the trust\\u2019s income be distributed as dividends to shareholders at least once per year. The majority of REITs operate as publicly traded entities and can be purchased through an investment broker.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"REITs are a relatively safe investment, but there are a few things to keep in mind before diving in. First, the yield you receive on your investment will depend on the performance of the underlying real estate. Second, REITs are highly sensitive to rising interest rates.

These are known as \"loads\" because they reduce your return. A no-load fund has no upfront or hidden costs. These mutual funds have a small initial investment requirement, which may be as little as $50.\nThese funds have other characteristics that make them different from those with load fees: No-load mutual funds generally don\\u2019t charge commissions or sales fees. They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public. There are no broker incentives like sales targets or bonus payments for selling certain shares.\nKeep reading to learn more about no-load mutual funds and whether they might be right for you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Diversifying your portfolio helps you manage risk and reduce the negative effects of a single investment falling dramatically in value.\nIf you invest your money in only one stock, mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you\\u2019re exposed to the risk that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket. If that stock plunges in value, so does your entire investment. But if you diversify across different types of investments, it\\u2019s more likely that at least some of your holdings will not suffer a similar fate.\nA well-diversified portfolio includes numerous asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash; several sizes and types of companies; and perhaps even real estate and alternative assets like private equity or venture capital trusts.
