For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further.

It\\u2019s not enough for a programming language to be perfect, complete and universal; if no one uses it, it\\u2019s useless. That\\u2019s why the design of any new programming language involves a lot of user research. The creators of Python \\u2014 an open-source general-purpose programming language first released in 1991 \\u2014 recognized from the start that if they were going to succeed, they needed to create a language that was accessible and appealing to a wide audience. And so, despite its many advanced features, Python remains transparent and straightforward, with syntax that directly addresses the needs and abilities of most programmers.\nRead on to learn more about this brilliant programming syntax and why you should take some time to get acquainted with Python today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

We will cover the fundamentals of setting up a project, creating tables and handling user logins.\nWe have all probably heard of SQL databases before. They are used to store data in tables so that you can query the data efficiently. Each table has columns with the properties of that entity stored as values in those columns.\nHowever, building an entire database from scratch is not something that most developers would want to do on a daily basis. This is where Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries come in useful. Instead of dealing directly with SQL tables and their contents, you can use these libraries to represent your domain objects as entities in their own right. Once you\\u2019ve done that, it becomes much easier to persist them into your database without writing any SQL statements yourself!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
