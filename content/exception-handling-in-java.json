For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further.

If your thoughts immediately went to the idea of parent and child classes, then you\\u2019ve either studied object-oriented programming or you understand the nuances of English. However, if you think about a parent giving birth to a child, then you obviously haven\\u2019t studied enough OOP. Let\\u2019s see what inheritance in Java is all about and why it\\u2019s useful.\nWe often find ourselves reusing code that has been implemented in some other class. This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another. This is called inheritance in Java. It is one of the cornerstones of OOP programming and something that every serious programmer should know well.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
