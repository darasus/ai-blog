  "intro": "In programming, nothing can be 100% perfect. There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as “exceptions”, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions. \nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has “exceptionally” failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.",
  "content": "## What is Exception handling in Java?\n\nWhen a Java application encounters an issue that makes it unable to proceed with its execution, it throws an exception. These exceptions are thrown by the application, caught by the host environment, logged, and then reported back to the user.\n## Java Exception Basics\n\nThere are two ways in which you can handle exceptions in Java. The first is to use try-catch blocks and the second is to use the checked and unchecked keywords. Using try-catch blocks is the recommended way of handling exceptions in Java.\n\nThe try-catch block is used when you expect your code to throw an exception. You code the blocks that could throw exceptions inside the try block and the code that will execute if no exceptions are thrown inside the catch block.\n\nThe checked and unchecked keywords are used when you expect a method to throw an exception, but the method is declared to never throw an exception. You use the checked keyword when calling a method that could throw an exception and you use the unchecked keyword when declaring a method that could throw an exception.\n\n## Checked and Unchecked Exceptions\n\nExceptions are typically thrown by the Java runtime environment and the code that you write, but exceptions that are thrown by the Java runtime environment are referred to as “checked exceptions” whereas exceptions that are thrown by your code are referred to as “unchecked exceptions”. You can use the checked and unchecked keywords to specify whether your methods could throw checked or unchecked exceptions.\n\nIf a method’s signature does not specify which exceptions it throws, the method is assumed to throw all checked exceptions. If a method’s signature specifies that it throws no checked exceptions, then all exceptions that the method could throw are assumed to be unchecked.\n\n## Error and Exception Differences\n\nThere are some subtle yet significant differences between errors and exceptions. For one, exceptions are represented as instances of a specific Java Exception subclass, while errors are represented as either an instance of an Error subclass or an instance of a RuntimeException subclass.\n\nExceptions are expected and are generated by the application, while errors are unexpected and are typically created by the Java runtime environment. Exceptions are represented as objects, while errors are represented as primitive types. Errors are logged by the Java runtime environment, while exceptions can be logged either by the application or the Java runtime environment. Exceptions are handled with try-catch blocks, while errors are typically handled with exception handlers.\n\n## Throw and Throwing Exceptions\n\nWhen a method is called, it could throw an exception if it has the potential to do so. In order to throw an exception, we use the throw keyword followed by the exception object that we want to throw. We could also create our own custom exception objects by extending the Exception class.\n\nThe throw keyword can be used with either the try or the catch block. If a method is called and it is expected to throw an exception but the method did not throw an exception, then you could use the throw keyword to throw the expected exception.\n\n## Java finally Block: How To Handle Finally\n\nYou will notice that we have the finally block at the end of our try-catch block examples. The finally block is always executed and it is guaranteed to be executed whether an exception is thrown by the application or not.\n\nThe finally block is used to perform any clean-up tasks that need to happen regardless of the execution path. You could use the finally block to close a database connection, clear a stream, or log an exception.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nExceptions are an important part of programming that you cannot avoid. It is crucial for programmers to understand how exceptions work in Java. This article will teach you about the exception handling in Java and how you can handle exceptions in your code. Additionally, you will also learn how to create your own custom exceptions in Java."
