For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further.

They create, maintain and update the software that powers businesses, websites and apps. And demand for software engineers continues to grow. Job postings for software engineers have increased by 37 percent in the last five years, with an additional 26 percent increase expected by 2024.\nSoftware engineering is also one of the most competitive fields to break into at the moment. There is a shortage of skilled candidates, which has led to high demand and high salaries for top software engineers who can drive innovation in their companies. To become a software engineer and land one of those coveted jobs, you will need to complete a computer science degree or take up coding classes.
