There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them.

Most people use their phones for either calling, texting or browsing the Internet. The world has moved on from feature phones to smartphones, which are more than just mobile phones. Smartphones come with pre-installed apps such as cameras, video players, and messaging services. Moreover, they also support third-party apps like music streaming services and games. Today\\u2019s mobile users expect their devices to be more than just communication tools; they want them to be an extension of their digital lifestyle. Therefore, developers need to create apps that take advantage of the smaller screen size and speed up load times by storing data locally where possible. There are many different programming languages used to make mobile applications; however, we will cover four of the most commonly used ones:\nSoftware development companies generally have some standard set of programming languages that they prefer working with. When it comes to mobile app development you might find one language rising above the rest based on its popularity among developers as well as other factors such as job demand for that specific language. Read on to learn about some of the most common programming languages for developing mobile apps:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
