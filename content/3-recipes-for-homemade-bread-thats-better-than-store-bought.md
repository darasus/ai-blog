## Better than store-bought bread: Sourdough bread

Sourdough bread is a type of fermented bread that has been around for centuries. It's made by a process that uses naturally occurring wild yeast instead of commercial yeast. This process results in a loaf of bread with a rich, hearty flavor that is unmatched in any store-bought variety.
Sourdough bread is a great choice for anyone who is looking to reduce the amount of processed foods in their diet. It's also a good option for those with a gluten or dairy allergy, since sourdough is naturally gluten-free and can be made with non-dairy ingredients.

## Better than store-bought bread: Whole wheat sandwich bread

Some of the best store-bought whole wheat breads are great, but they're often incredibly dense and heavy. This is because they're made with a ton of water and a lot of extra ingredients to make them light and fluffy. If you're going for the real deal and want a fluffy-yet-nutritious slice of whole wheat bread, you have to bake it yourself at home. The secret to a light and airy whole wheat loaf is to use gluten-free all-purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour, and the perfect ratio of water.

## Better than store-bought bread: Hot dog buns

Hot dog buns are great, but they are not the healthiest option. Luckily, they're actually really easy to make at home. The best way to make hot dog buns at home is to use a hot dog bun recipe that uses the same ratio of ingredients as sandwich bread.
This will result in a soft and fluffy bun that is perfect for a hot dog or hamburger. It will have a bit more structure than a hot dog bun made with all-purpose flour, making it more suitable for use as a sandwich bun as well.

## Better than store-bought bread: pizza dough and calzones

Pizza dough is another great recipe to have in your baking arsenal. It's easy to make and can be used for so much more than just pizza — from calzones to breadsticks! A good pizza dough starts with a strong mixture of flour and water, which helps the dough rise and stay soft and chewy. The best types of flour to use for pizza include unbleached all-purpose or bread flour. It's also important to use a warm water bath when mixing the dough, which will help activate the yeast and make the dough rise more quickly.

## Better than store-bruh BAKERY RECIPES: cheddar garlic bread and cheesy artisan loaves
Once you've mastered the art of bread, the sky is the limit! Cheddar garlic bread and cheesy artisan loaves are two of the most delicious homemade bread recipes out there. The trick to a great loaf of bread is to start with a good dough. Once you have your dough down, you can mix in any ingredients you want.
Cheddar garlic bread is a great choice for bread that has a cheesy, garlic kick. Simply add shredded cheddar cheese and minced garlic to the dough and bake for a delicious loaf.

## Better than store-bruh FINAL THOUGHTS

Bread is one of those foods that is best when made fresh. When you bake your own bread, you know exactly what is going into it, and you can tailor it to your dietary preferences. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to baking your own bread, but once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to buy store-bought again!
