## Brainstorming Is The Key

One of the best ways to start your article writing process is to brainstorm. This is a technique used by writers and creatives in many different fields, and it can help you come up with ideas that you might not otherwise think of. There are a few different ways to go about this. If you have a particular topic or area you would like to write about, you can brainstorm topics related to that. If you have no idea where to start, there are some general brainstorming techniques you can use to help generate ideas. When brainstorming, you want to give yourself plenty of time to come up with as many ideas as possible. The more ideas you have to choose from, the easier it will be to come up with a great article. You should also brainstorm alone, without any distractions, so that you are able

## Narrow Down Your Options

Once you have brainstormed all the ideas you can, it’s time to start narrowing them down. You don’t want to write a thousand-word article on every topic you brainstormed, so you need to choose which ones are right for your article. A good way to do this is to ask yourself a few questions about each idea. Why do you like this idea? What would someone learn from it? How is it unique compared to other ideas you’ve come up with? If you have trouble deciding between two ideas, try combining them. You may find that combining two ideas is better than either one alone. Once you’ve narrowed down your options, write them down so you don’t forget them.

## Don’t Be Afraid To Go Off Topic

Sometimes, when you’re writing an article, you will discover that you just can’t come up with anything to write about. You’ve brainstormed all your ideas, narrowed them down to the best ones, and you still can’t think of anything to write. Don’t panic! Instead, go off topic. When you go off topic, you don’t have to tie what you’re writing to the article you’re writing it for. This can be a great way to come up with content that is still relevant but doesn’t fit the original idea. For example, let’s say you’re supposed to write an article about homemade bread. You’ve brainstormed all your ideas and narrowed them down, but you still can’t think of anything to write about. You decide to go off

## Write A Rough Draft

Once you’ve got a good idea for an article, it’s time to write a rough draft. This is where you actually write out your article. Depending on your topic, you may want to do more research first before writing a rough draft. This can be anything from reading other articles to make sure your article is original, to researching statistics on your topic, to make sure you are correct in what you’re writing. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to write. You may want to write your article in a word processing program or on a website like

## Summing Up

Now that you’ve finished your article, it’s time to summarize it. This doesn’t mean that you actually summarize the article; instead, you summarize your writing process. You can write about how you came up with the idea for the article, what research you did, how you organized your article, and anything else that you found helpful during the writing process. This can be helpful for other people trying to write articles, as well as for you when you write another article. It can also be a good way to review everything you’ve written.
