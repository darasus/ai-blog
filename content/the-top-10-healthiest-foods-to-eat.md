## Jump-start your writing session with a brain dump

If you’re stuck in the middle of your article and don’t know what to write next, try what is known as a brain dump. This is when you write down everything that comes to mind about your topic. This can include the overall idea of what you are trying to say, subtopics, examples, and anything else that comes to mind. This can help you get going again – you’ll have a lot of material to work with!

Brain dumps can be especially useful when you’re writing about something you’re not familiar with. For example, if you’re writing about a health topic and you’re not a doctor, you probably don’t know everything about what makes certain foods healthier than others. Taking a brain dump will allow you to have all the necessary information to get started.

## Play a game to generate ideas

If you still feel stuck while trying to write those words, then try playing a game. Not only will this help you get your creative juices flowing, but it will also help you come up with fresh ideas.

Some games that can help spark your creativity include: Scrabble, Boggle, word searches, or crossword puzzles. There are also online word generators, random word generators, and word puzzle games that you can play online.

Scrabble is a word game that will allow you to use your imagination to create new words from existing letters. This will get your creative juices flowing, and you may even discover new words that you never knew existed. 

Word searches are another game that can help you generate new ideas. You can find word search puzzles online or in puzzle books. You can also try crossword puzzles – these work like word searches, but with a twist.

## Write the sentence that you already know is coming

Sometimes, no matter what you do, you just can’t seem to get going. You have the topic clearly in your mind, but for some reason, it’s just not coming out right. Try writing the sentence that you already know is coming next. This is a trick that professional journalists use when they are trying to finish an article and they are running out of time. It works like this: Find the last sentence of your article and start writing the next sentence. From there, you’re going to write the rest of your article. This may sound too easy, but it really works! And if you’re having trouble getting started with your article, this might be the trick you need.

## Write the conclusion while you’re still generating ideas

Writing the conclusion of your article while you are still generating ideas for the body of your article can be helpful if you’re struggling to come up with content. The conclusion of your article is the last thing that your reader will read, so it needs to be powerful and eye-catching. It needs to draw your reader in and make them want to read the article. You can use the conclusion as your inspiration for coming up with the body of your article. Or, you can write the conclusion first, and then write the rest of your article around it.

The conclusion is a short summary of the article, so you know what information you need to include in it. If you find yourself struggling to come up with content, try using the conclusion as your inspiration.

## Write a list of all the words that come to mind

Sometimes, you don’t know where to start, but you are getting ideas. You have a ton of ideas in your mind, but you don’t know what to do with them. This may be especially true when you are writing a health article, as these are often extremely technical.
You may also have a difficult time coming up with health related words, as you may have not encountered them before. To get past this, try writing a list of all the words that come to mind. This can be anything from action words to food-related words. You can also use the thesaurus to find other words if you are struggling to find them.

## Sum up the article in your own words

When you’re trying to write another article but you don’t know where to start, try summarizing the article in your own words. You can write the summary of your article in the first person. This may sound a bit weird, but it really works!

When you summarize the article in your own words, you will have all the information you need to start writing your article. This is especially helpful if you are writing health and fitness articles, as these articles are often extremely technical. You may also have a difficult time coming up with health related words, as you may have not encountered them before. When you summarize the article in your own words, you will have all the information you need to write your article.

## Come back to what has stuck and flesh it out

If you’re having a really tough time generating ideas and getting started with your article, don’t force yourself to write it all at once. Instead, come back to it later when you have more time and have had a chance to let your ideas flow.
One of the best ways to come back to your article is to set it aside for a while. Put it aside for a day or two, or even a week. If you are really having trouble starting it, then come back to it in a month. You may be surprised by how much easier the article comes to you when you give yourself more time.

You may notice that some ideas that you had when you started writing the article have stuck, and you can flesh them out. This is a great way to get past the writer’s block and complete your article.
