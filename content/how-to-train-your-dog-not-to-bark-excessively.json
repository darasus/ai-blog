You spend time getting to know each other and spending time together as much as possible. But things can change once you enter a committed relationship or get married. Stressors from work, family, friends and other responsibilities may arise, putting stress on your relationship. This is when green-eyed monster envy creeps in and can have a negative impact on your partner.\nThere are many different types of relationships: friendships, casual dating or serious partners. Regardless of what type of relationships you have with another person, envy probably won\\u2019t be far behind if they are important to you. Envy is one of the seven deadly sins for good reason. When we experience envy in a relationship it creates distrust, resentment and can ultimately end things prematurely before they even really begin. However, there are ways to deal with this feeling so that it doesn\\u2019t get the better of you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
