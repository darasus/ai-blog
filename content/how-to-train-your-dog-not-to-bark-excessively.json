Mediation isn\\u2019t just for couples who are breaking up or divorcing; it can be useful in resolving disputes with co-workers, business partners, friends or family members.\nMediation is cost-effective and time-efficient, reducing the potential for long legal battles and the financial and emotional costs that go with them. In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person\\u2019s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.\nAdditionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial. If you\\u2019re interested in learning more about this resolution process as a way to manage your own conflict or as an advisor if you are working with someone who needs help resolving their dispute, read on.

However, if the parties choose to enter into such an agreement, it can help them move past their differences and work together constructively going forward.\nMediation is very different from other forms of ADR because there is no neutral third party adjudicator present during mediation sessions. Rather, both parties agree to let a neutral mediator facilitate their discussion and suggest ways the two sides might be able to settle on amicable terms that are mutually beneficial.\nFurthermore, unlike arbitration, which uses a third party neutral arbitrator to resolve disputes privately with no input from either party, with mediation there\\u2019s no need for secret proceedings or winner take all outcomes.
