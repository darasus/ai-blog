Odyssey takes that formula and not only improves it but also transports it to an entirely new era.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Red Dead Redemption 2 - Rockstar Games is no stranger to long gaps between releases, and it\\u2019s been nearly eight years since the release of their last Western-style game, Red Dead Redemption. Thankfully, the sequel is well worth the wait, offering a vast open world, a massive amount of content, and a story that is just as compelling as it was back in 2010.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Halo Infinite - When a new console generation starts, it\\u2019s not uncommon for some of the biggest, most iconic franchises to sit out the initial release. Halo is one of these, and while it is a shame that we won\\u2019t see a new mainline entry this year, the next big thing in the series is looking exciting indeed.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Shadow of the Tomb Raider - The latest chapter in Lara Croft\\u2019s story is one that ends the trilogy on a high note.

Yes, CD Projekt Red has had their hands full creating a new game engine, but with the buzz and hype around this title, the developer has created a situation where the expectations are so high that anything short of amazing will be seen as a disappointment.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Anthem - The idea behind BioWare making a multiplayer action-RPG has a lot of potential behind it. The execution, however, has proven to be a bit of a mess. With a smattering of bugs, a lack of content compared to other online games released this year, and online implementation that is a bit clunky, this title has a lot to be desired.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Crackdown 3 - It\\u2019s tough to be a launch title, especially when you\\u2019re one of the very few games tied to the release of a brand new console.

These are also some of the most challenging and difficult ones to make. Cracking the code on how to build a well-crafted and engaging video game requires practice, ingenuity, skill, and patience. But not every developer is up to the task. Some simply fail at creating an entertaining experience for players. This list compiles some of the disappointments from 2018 that failed to meet an acceptable standard of quality.\nThese are the worst games of 2018, broken down by category and listed in no particular order. Some might have had good intentions or interesting concepts, but fell short in their execution.

These are often referred to as \\u201CGame of the Year\\u201D awards, but they are not all created equal. Some use a points-based system, while others ask critics to vote on individual games and not just give them a list of possible answers.\nThere is also no standard definition for what qualifies as an \\u201Coverrated\\u201D game. Some people might interpret it to mean any game that received generally positive reviews but has little chance of winning a Game of the Year award. Others assume it must be a high-profile title that almost everyone agrees is terrible but continues to sell well because it has been overhyped by gaming journalists and analysts.
