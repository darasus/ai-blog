  "summary": "This year has been a very good year for video games. With all the excellent titles that have already released, thereâ€™s plenty for gamers to look forward to in 2019. There has been something for everyone this year, including a brand new property or a return to an older title. The worst game of the year was Crackdown 3, with a few bugs and a lack of content compared to other online games released this year. The best video game of 2019 is Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, the latest chapter of the Tomb Raider.",

In 2018, we saw new entries in long-running series like Red Dead Redemption, Assassin\\u2019s Creed, and Halo as well as brand new IP such as Monster Hunter: World, Into the Breach, and A Way Out. It was a year that saw game developers pushed by streaming services like Twitch and YouTube continue to experiment with new ideas and designs while also returning to their roots with older properties.\nThat being said, not all games are created equal. There are excellent games and then there are... others less so. To help you sort through the deluge of new releases this year, Gamers Central has compiled a list of our top ten favorite titles coupled with an even longer list of disappointments that you may want to avoid entirely or at least wait for a sale before picking up.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Odyssey takes that formula and not only improves it but also transports it to an entirely new era.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Red Dead Redemption 2 - Rockstar Games is no stranger to long gaps between releases, and it\\u2019s been nearly eight years since the release of their last Western-style game, Red Dead Redemption. Thankfully, the sequel is well worth the wait, offering a vast open world, a massive amount of content, and a story that is just as compelling as it was back in 2010.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Halo Infinite - When a new console generation starts, it\\u2019s not uncommon for some of the biggest, most iconic franchises to sit out the initial release. Halo is one of these, and while it is a shame that we won\\u2019t see a new mainline entry this year, the next big thing in the series is looking exciting indeed.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Shadow of the Tomb Raider - The latest chapter in Lara Croft\\u2019s story is one that ends the trilogy on a high note.

Yes, CD Projekt Red has had their hands full creating a new game engine, but with the buzz and hype around this title, the developer has created a situation where the expectations are so high that anything short of amazing will be seen as a disappointment.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Anthem - The idea behind BioWare making a multiplayer action-RPG has a lot of potential behind it. The execution, however, has proven to be a bit of a mess. With a smattering of bugs, a lack of content compared to other online games released this year, and online implementation that is a bit clunky, this title has a lot to be desired.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Crackdown 3 - It\\u2019s tough to be a launch title, especially when you\\u2019re one of the very few games tied to the release of a brand new console.
