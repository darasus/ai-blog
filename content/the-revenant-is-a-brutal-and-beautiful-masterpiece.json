Alejandro Gonz\\xE1lez I\\xF1\\xE1rritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s estimated that the film crew spent over 400 days shooting \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D in difficult conditions. The wilds of Alberta are not temperate, and snowfall is a very real and very dangerous thing to deal with in the middle of filming.

By the end of the film you are able to understand the motivations behind each character, even the ones who seem to be pure evil. It is through this that we get a glimpse into the true nature of humanity \\u2013 we come to understand that everyone is fighting for something, even the seemingly \\u201Cevil\\u201D characters.

For one, pay attention to the bear scene. DiCaprio and the crew actually filmed this scene with a real bear, so be sure to keep an eye on the bear while watching. Another thing to look out for is the themes of the film. There are many themes to discover within the film, including the idea that we are all equals; no one is better than another. We also see that true beauty comes from the struggle of surviving in a brutal world, and that revenge is not the answer to our problems.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Finally, look out for the symbolism within the film. Many of the props and costumes within the film have been designed to hold a deeper meaning. For example, the bear\\u2019s claw necklace that DiCaprio wears throughout the film is supposed to represent nature\\u2019s taking of one life in order to give another.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Final Words: An experience you will not soon forget\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If all this hasn\\u2019t convinced you, then nothing will. \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D is a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll. It\\u2019s a brutal and violent film, but it is also a beautiful and inspiring tale. It is a film that shows us that while we may not always win the battle, we must always continue pushing forward. It is a film that shows us that even the strongest among us have weaknesses. It is a film that will leave you breathless with its beautiful cinematography, its brutal and visceral combat, and its deep and meaningful story.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Monsters, ghosts and psychotic killers are no longer frightening, so viewers instead get the same story with a different setting, characters and victim every time. The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days. From vampires to werewolves to Frankenstein\\u2019s monster and his re-imagined counterpart, Victor Frankenstein, there isn\\u2019t much left that hasn\\u2019t already been done multiple times before. In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts. But then again\\u2026 The Babadook doesn\\u2019t exactly follow the same formulaic structure either.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
