  "summary": "‘The Revenant’ is a brutal and violent film, but it is also a beautiful tale that shows us that we must always always win the battle. Leonardo DiCaprio spent months living and breathing the role of Hugh Glass in the wilds of Alberta for the duration of filming, meaning no hotels for them, just tents in the snowy wilderness. There are many themes to discover within the film, including the themes that we are all equals; no one is better than another, and that revenge is not the answer to our problems.",
  "intro": "There are movies that make you feel things, and then there are movies that make you feel things so viscerally and intensely that you’re left breathless. “The Revenant” is one of those films. Alejandro González Iñárritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, “The Revenant” features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn’t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to “Inception” – it’s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.",
  "content": "## The art of filming in the wild\n\nOne of the most impressive feats of this film is that it was filmed in the wilderness of Alberta, Canada – it is truly a feat to be able to film such a massive movie in the midst of nowhere. It’s estimated that the film crew spent over 400 days shooting “The Revenant” in difficult conditions. The wilds of Alberta are not temperate, and snowfall is a very real and very dangerous thing to deal with in the middle of filming. This meant that the cast and crew would have to pack up and relocate to a different location every few days as the snowfall would make shooting in the original location impossible.\n\nThis wasn’t the only difficulty the crew had to deal with either. Bears are a very real danger in Alberta, and the crew had to use trained bear dogs to protect their food from the bears. This was especially important as the cast and crew lived in the wilds of Alberta for the duration of filming, meaning no hotels for them, just tents in the snowy wilderness.\n\n## More than just a movie about revenge\n\nNow don’t get us wrong, “The Revenant” is a movie that is mostly about revenge. But it’s also a movie that delves into the very nature of what it means to be human. “The Revenant” takes its time introducing its characters, allowing the audience to get to know them before they are put into an impossible situation where they have no choice but to fight for their lives. By the end of the film you are able to understand the motivations behind each character, even the ones who seem to be pure evil. It is through this that we get a glimpse into the true nature of humanity – we come to understand that everyone is fighting for something, even the seemingly “evil” characters. We also come to understand that some of these battles are more difficult than others; that some fights are impossible to win.\n\nHugh Glass himself is a man who loses everything along his journey. He loses his son, his child, his wife, his health, his dignity, and more along the way. He is pushed to the brink of death, and yet he still fights for survival. He is a man who has no choice but to fight against his very humanity in order to survive.\n\n## The best performance of Leonardo DiCaprio’s career\n\nThere’s no doubt that DiCaprio is one of the greatest actors of our generation, but in “The Revenant” he has taken his acting to a whole new level. DiCaprio spent months living and breathing the role of Hugh Glass. He was so committed to the role that his co-stars started calling him “Dr. Living-in-the-Wild”. He even ate raw bison liver and slept in animal carcasses to get into character.\n\nThis dedication to his art is what makes DiCaprio’s performance in “The Revenant” so phenomenal. He is able to take an otherwise one-dimensional character and make him feel like a real person. You can feel his pain, you can feel his suffering, thanks to the dedication that DiCaprio has put into the role.\n\n## Things to look out for while watching “The Revenant”\n\nThere are so many things to look out for while watching “The Revenant”. For one, pay attention to the bear scene. DiCaprio and the crew actually filmed this scene with a real bear, so be sure to keep an eye on the bear while watching. Another thing to look out for is the themes of the film. There are many themes to discover within the film, including the idea that we are all equals; no one is better than another. We also see that true beauty comes from the struggle of surviving in a brutal world, and that revenge is not the answer to our problems.\n\nFinally, look out for the symbolism within the film. Many of the props and costumes within the film have been designed to hold a deeper meaning. For example, the bear’s claw necklace that DiCaprio wears throughout the film is supposed to represent nature’s taking of one life in order to give another.\n\n## Final Words: An experience you will not soon forget\n\nIf all this hasn’t convinced you, then nothing will. “The Revenant” is a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll. It’s a brutal and violent film, but it is also a beautiful and inspiring tale. It is a film that shows us that while we may not always win the battle, we must always continue pushing forward. It is a film that shows us that even the strongest among us have weaknesses. It is a film that will leave you breathless with its beautiful cinematography, its brutal and visceral combat, and its deep and meaningful story."
