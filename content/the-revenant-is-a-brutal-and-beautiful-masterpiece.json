Alejandro Gonz\\xE1lez I\\xF1\\xE1rritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s estimated that the film crew spent over 400 days shooting \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D in difficult conditions. The wilds of Alberta are not temperate, and snowfall is a very real and very dangerous thing to deal with in the middle of filming. This meant that the cast and crew would have to pack up and relocate to a different location every few days as the snowfall would make shooting in the original location impossible.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This wasn\\u2019t the only difficulty the crew had to deal with either. Bears are a very real danger in Alberta, and the crew had to use trained bear dogs to protect their food from the bears.

But it\\u2019s also a movie that delves into the very nature of what it means to be human. \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D takes its time introducing its characters, allowing the audience to get to know them before they are put into an impossible situation where they have no choice but to fight for their lives. By the end of the film you are able to understand the motivations behind each character, even the ones who seem to be pure evil. It is through this that we get a glimpse into the true nature of humanity \\u2013 we come to understand that everyone is fighting for something, even the seemingly \\u201Cevil\\u201D characters. We also come to understand that some of these battles are more difficult than others; that some fights are impossible to win.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Hugh Glass himself is a man who loses everything along his journey.

DiCaprio spent months living and breathing the role of Hugh Glass. He was so committed to the role that his co-stars started calling him \\u201CDr. Living-in-the-Wild\\u201D. He even ate raw bison liver and slept in animal carcasses to get into character.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This dedication to his art is what makes DiCaprio\\u2019s performance in \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D so phenomenal.

For one, pay attention to the bear scene. DiCaprio and the crew actually filmed this scene with a real bear, so be sure to keep an eye on the bear while watching. Another thing to look out for is the themes of the film. There are many themes to discover within the film, including the idea that we are all equals; no one is better than another. We also see that true beauty comes from the struggle of surviving in a brutal world, and that revenge is not the answer to our problems.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Finally, look out for the symbolism within the film. Many of the props and costumes within the film have been designed to hold a deeper meaning. For example, the bear\\u2019s claw necklace that DiCaprio wears throughout the film is supposed to represent nature\\u2019s taking of one life in order to give another.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Final Words: An experience you will not soon forget\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If all this hasn\\u2019t convinced you, then nothing will. \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D is a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll. It\\u2019s a brutal and violent film, but it is also a beautiful and inspiring tale. It is a film that shows us that while we may not always win the battle, we must always continue pushing forward. It is a film that shows us that even the strongest among us have weaknesses. It is a film that will leave you breathless with its beautiful cinematography, its brutal and visceral combat, and its deep and meaningful story.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

He also has a lot of fun with his predicament, cracking jokes through his video log and even going disco.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
