Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823.

The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer.

At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory.\nThis is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it\\u2019s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse \\u2014 instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.\nA few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete \\u2018A Brief History of Time\\u2019 which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold. In 2014, the film \\u2018The Theory of Everything\\u2019 was released based on the book by Jane Hawking about her marriage with Stephen which further cemented his fame as one of the most brilliant minds in history today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before.
