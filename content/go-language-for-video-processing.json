  "summary": "The video processing industry uses a variety of tools and technologies to get their job done. AI is a type of technology that’s designed to create machines that can learn, understand, and create on their own. This is because these algorithms are programmed to recognize visual patterns and then make predictions based on what they’ve learned. AI can help businesses in this industry process more video and images in less time, which can equate to more profit for businesses. The most popular AI algorithm for this industry is a deep neural network.",

Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive. However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIf you\\u2019re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI.
