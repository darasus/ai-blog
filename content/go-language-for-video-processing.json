  "summary": "The video processing industry uses a variety of tools and technologies to get their job done. AI is a type of technology that’s designed to create machines that can learn, understand, and create on their own. This is because these algorithms are programmed to recognize visual patterns and then make predictions based on what they’ve learned. AI can help businesses in this industry process more video and images in less time, which can equate to more profit for businesses. The most popular AI algorithm for this industry is a deep neural network.",

This is primarily due to the rise of social media and the prevalence of user-generated content. As a result, there are now a plethora of video editing apps that allow users to add filters to their videos, create green-screen effects, and more. Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive. However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIf you\\u2019re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI. Additionally, we\\u2019ll explore some common applications of Go for AI and video processing as well as provide examples of programs written in Go that can be used by you if you want to get started sooner rather than later!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Commercial film was first used during the Great Depression as a way to create employment. The industry continued to grow during the 20th century with the development of new technologies, like television and digital video, becoming a major source of revenue for media companies. In recent years, video processing has seen an even larger increase in popularity thanks to the rise of social media and user-generated content.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Does the Video Processing Industry Need AI?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"AI is a type of technology that\\u2019s designed to create machines that can learn, understand, and create on their own. Put simply, AI is capable of doing things that humans can\\u2019t do alone, like processed huge amounts of data quickly, create more intricate designs, and handle tasks that are dangerous or too difficult for humans. It\\u2019s common to see machine learning algorithms in applications like image and video processing. This is because these algorithms are programmed to recognize visual patterns and then make predictions based on what they\\u2019ve learned. Put simply, image and video processing with AI can help businesses in this industry to process more complex videos and images with ease.
