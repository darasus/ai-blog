intro: >-
  Amazon has a reputation as being one of the most user-friendly and
  trustworthy e-commerce sites. But while its user experience is second to none,
  Amazon is not perfect. In fact, the company has a rather sinister side that
  few customers are aware of.

  e-Commerce giant Amazon recently opened its 10th fulfillment center in New Hampshire. The company now employs more than 7,000 people in New Hampshire and has invested over $300 million in the state. With over 566 million active users worldwide, it’s safe to say that Amazon is a well-known and trusted brand. 

  However, if you look a little deeper into how Amazon operates as a business, you’ll discover some pretty sinister things about them – many of which you won’t read about in their press releases or see on their “About Us” pages. Here are some of the darker sides of this well-loved brand:

## Amazon pays employees 15% less than the minimum wage

Amazon has come under a lot of fire recently for the fact that they pay their workers less than the minimum wage. In fact, over two thousand Amazon employees in the UK recently signed a petition demanding an increase in their wages, claiming that the minimum wage Amazon is paying them is barely enough to live on.
This controversy has also spread to the US, where Amazon has been accused of paying its fulfillment center employees 15% less than the minimum wage – despite receiving millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state of California.
Amazon has long maintained that its wages are fair, but critics have pointed out that this is hardly surprising when you consider that Amazon’s board of directors includes the CEO of Target and the President of Walgreens – two companies that have also been criticized for unfair treatment of employees.

## Amazon is currently facing 9 separate lawsuits for unfair business practices

As if paying employees less than the minimum wage wasn’t bad enough, Amazon is currently facing 9 separate lawsuits for unfair business practices. The most high-profile of these is a lawsuit from the State of Washington, alleging that Amazon has broken anti-trust laws.
In Washington, the State Attorney General is accusing Amazon of engaging in anti-competitive behavior – something that’s very difficult to prove. However, Washington’s suit does not rely on the state having to prove that Amazon is acting illegally. Instead, it simply accuses Amazon of acting in an “anti-competitive manner” – which is a much lower bar that can be much more easily proven.

## Amazon’s warehouses are horrendous places to work

For years now, Amazon has been criticized for the way it treats its warehouse workers. In fact, conditions at Amazon’s warehouses are so horrendous that they’ve even been compared to a “Victorian workhouse.”
This criticism has come on both sides of the Atlantic, and Amazon has been hit with both lawsuits and complaints from workers in England, Scotland, and the United States.

## Amazon regularly pressures suppliers to provide wrong information

Amazon has been accused of regularly pressuring suppliers to provide them with incorrect information – such as false sales figures and inaccurate inventory data.
This has allegedly been done to create an illusion of demand for products that are in fact selling poorly. This, in turn, has allowed Amazon to artificially inflate the prices of certain products and therefore increase their profits.

## Amazon tracks almost everything you do and knows more about you than you think

Whilst you might think that you’re relatively safe from Amazon’s prying eyes if you aren’t logged into their website, this isn’t actually the case. Thanks to a tool called “AMZN Mobile Analytics,” Amazon actually tracks the browsing activity of unregistered users across the web – even if they’re not logged into Amazon.

This allows Amazon to track and monitor the online behavior of millions of people every year – all without their knowledge or consent. This has raised privacy concerns among consumer watchdogs, who have described Amazon’s actions as “unwanted” and “alarming.”

## Conclusion

Despite being one of the most popular e-commerce sites in the world, Amazon has a dark and sinister side that few customers are aware of. While Amazon may be a convenient way to shop online, it is certainly not worth the cost to your privacy.

There are plenty of other e-commerce sites out there that don’t exploit their employees, lie to suppliers, or track millions of people across the internet. If you’re looking for a more trustworthy e-commerce experience, it may be worth it to steer clear of Amazon.
