## Start with a small amount and invest regularly

One of the easiest ways to get started investing is with small, regular investments. Take the amount you have available and invest it regularly, setting up a schedule that lets you know how much you have and when to put it away. Even $25 a month is enough to see returns over time, and $25 a week, though that may feel less significant, can add up. Start small—even the smallest amount can have a huge impact over time.

One of the most important things to do when you're starting out is to get into good investing habits as soon as possible. This means automating your investment process as much as possible so that it becomes a regular part of your finances. By setting up an automatic monthly investment plan, you'll ensure that you'll always have money invested, even when you don't feel like putting anything away.

## Diversify Among Many Different Sectors

When starting out, it’s important to diversify your portfolio among many different sectors to reduce your risk of loss. By spreading your investment across five or more different sectors, you protect yourself against any one market sector declining. This will help you keep more of your money while still growing your portfolio. Sector funds, which are funds that invest in several companies in a particular industry, are a good way to diversify your portfolio.

If you don’t have enough money to diversify, you can also diversify your portfolio by time. Start with a longer-term investment like a bond fund, which will pay out a higher interest rate than a savings account but doesn’t have the risk of equity, and balance it with a shorter-term investment like a stock fund or individual stocks, which will see greater returns but are riskier.

## Choose cheap, well-reseaed investments

Start with low-fee funds and individual stocks, and don’t buy anything you don’t understand. You don’t want to start off with expensive, high-risk funds that charge a lot in fees. You don’t have the money to lose, and you don’t have the experience to confidently navigate high-risk funds. Start with low-fee, low-risk funds and individual stocks you understand, like those of your employers or those of companies you’re passionate about and familiar with.

Another thing to look out for when investing in funds is the amount of liquidity. You don’t want to tie up all your money in investments that you can’t get out of quickly in case you need it. Look for a low-cost fund with a low amount of liquidity.

## Finding the bottom of the barrel: Mutual Funds

If you’re just getting started, mutual funds are a great, low-risk way to invest money. A mutual fund is a type of investment that pools money from many investors and invests that money into various assets, like stocks or bonds. Mutual funds offer a diversified way to invest your money in lots of different stocks and bonds, and the fund managers will choose which ones based on your risk tolerance.

Mutual funds are often available through your 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan, or you can invest in them through a financial advisor or online platform. Mutual funds come with fees, just like with any other investment, so be sure to read up on them and make sure they’re reasonable.

## Robo-Advisors: Automated Investment Services

Robo-advisors are automated investment services that manage your money with computer algorithms. They’re a great way to start investing because they’re cheap, easy to set up, and can help you diversify your funds with little effort on your part. A good robo-advisor will let you choose funds that best suit your risk tolerance, and you can set up regular automatic deposits so you don’t have to worry about adding money to your account.
Robo-advisors are low-cost, easy-to-use services that manage your investments for you. They’re great for beginners because you don’t have to pick individual stocks or funds and can choose from a wide variety of pre-made portfolios. The best robo-advisors will also help you figure out how much you should be investing and keep track of your progress.

## The Bottom Line

The more you know about investing and the various types of investments out there, the better off you’ll be in the long run. Start with a small amount and invest regularly, diversify among many different sectors, choose cheap, well-reseaed investments, and find the bottom of the barrel in mutual funds. Once you get started, it’s important to be patient and consistent. Even a small amount saved consistently over time will add up to a decent nest egg.
