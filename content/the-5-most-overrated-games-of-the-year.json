There are few games that have aged as well as this series, and modern audiences have been very receptive to it.\nUnfortunately, the N. Sane Trilogy is also one of the most overrated games of 2018. As a collection of remastered games that have not been significantly updated since the original PlayStation release, it is not a very creative choice for 2018.\nWhile it is easy to understand why people would love to play these games again, there are very few things that make this a better experience than the original PlayStation 1 versions. Despite the visual improvements, everything else about the remaster feels dated. The controls are exactly the same as the original PlayStation versions, so they feel clunky and unresponsive in a way that is especially noticeable in the third game.\nThere is also no real reason why this game needed to be released in 2018. Yes, it was fun to play it again and see how the series has aged, but it would have been just as fun to play versions of these games that had been updated for modern platforms. The N.

The problem is that Dark Souls Remastered is not a new game, it is a port featuring minor visual improvements and nothing more.\nIt is easy to see why people would love to play this game again, but it is still a very minor alteration of a game that came out over 10 years ago.\nThe core gameplay is the same and only the graphics have been updated. It is far from the best remaster that we have ever seen, and it does not seem worth it for new players to spend money on a game that came out over 10 years ago.\nEven though it is a great game, it is not worth revisiting unless you are an absolute fan of the series. Dark Souls Remastered is certainly a worthy re-release, but it is not a game that people should be recommending to anyone who has never played a Souls game before.\nIt is worth replaying if you have already played the original game and are looking to replay it in a slightly better form, but it is far from an essential purchase for most people.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Super Smash Bros.

This is a game that people were so excited for that many were willing to overlook any flaws it might have.\nIt is easy to see why this game is overrated given that it is the first new entry in the series in 5 years, but there are just as many reasons why it should not be as praised as it is.\nThe game is undeniably fun, but it is also undeniably a shallow experience. It is not a game that people should be praising as being some sort of masterpiece.
