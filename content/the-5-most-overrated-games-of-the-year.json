There are few games that have aged as well as this series, and modern audiences have been very receptive to it.\nUnfortunately, the N. Sane Trilogy is also one of the most overrated games of 2018. As a collection of remastered games that have not been significantly updated since the original PlayStation release, it is not a very creative choice for 2018.\nWhile it is easy to understand why people would love to play these games again, there are very few things that make this a better experience than the original PlayStation 1 versions. Despite the visual improvements, everything else about the remaster feels dated. The controls are exactly the same as the original PlayStation versions, so they feel clunky and unresponsive in a way that is especially noticeable in the third game.\nThere is also no real reason why this game needed to be released in 2018. Yes, it was fun to play it again and see how the series has aged, but it would have been just as fun to play versions of these games that had been updated for modern platforms. The N.

It is far from the best remaster that we have ever seen, and it does not seem worth it for new players to spend money on a game that came out over 10 years ago.\nEven though it is a great game, it is not worth revisiting unless you are an absolute fan of the series. Dark Souls Remastered is certainly a worthy re-release, but it is not a game that people should be recommending to anyone who has never played a Souls game before.\nIt is worth replaying if you have already played the original game and are looking to replay it in a slightly better form, but it is far from an essential purchase for most people.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Super Smash Bros.
