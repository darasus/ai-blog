  You see it everywhere these days: people talking about eating healthier,
  cleaner and more nutritious foods. Even famous athletes are getting in on the
  action. Superstars like LeBron James and Tom Brady are known for their high
  performance on game day as much as their off-season diet. The only problem

  challenge to follow every single day. But what if you could make it easier? 

  It’t not crazy to think you can eat healthier every day. After all, you aren’t permanently locked into an unhealthy lifestyle. Your habits change over time, which means your diet can too!

## Plan Your Meals

If you want to eat healthier, you first have to plan for it. And this isn’t about creating a detailed meal plan for each day of the week — though you can do that too if you want — it’s about making choices during the week that will make your desired diet easier to achieve. This will mean shopping for the right foods, making time to prepare meals, and finding ways to avoid unhealthy eating situations.

Keeping healthy snacks on hand — like fruit, nuts, and veggies — will help you avoid making poor choices when you’re hungry. Avoiding situations where there will be unhealthy temptations will also make sticking to your eating goals easier. This doesn’t mean you have to avoid social situations entirely but it does mean being mindful of what’s available to eat and making the right choices.

## Avoid processed foods

The less processed your food is, the better it is for your health. Simply put, processed foods are food products that have had some form of alteration in how they are made. This could include adding sugar, salt, and preservatives to food that doesn’t require them, or taking something like corn and making it into something like corn flakes.

Processed foods are typically high in sugar, salt, and fat, which means they’re not exactly diet-friendly. Eating more whole foods is a simple way to ensure you’re eating healthier. This doesn’t mean you have to cut out all processed foods but it does mean making an effort to eat more unprocessed foods rather than buying the pre-made stuff.

## Stick to whole foods

Whole foods are foods in their most natural state, meaning they haven’t been processed or refined in any way. This means they are packed with more nutrients than processed foods, which means they’re better for you in almost every way. If you ever find yourself wondering, “is this a whole food?” the answer will probably be yes.

Whole foods are better for your health, your weight, and your budget. They can be eaten as-is or added to recipes for an added nutritional punch. Whole foods are available in both fresh and dried forms. So, when you head to the grocery store, you’ll want to choose fresh whenever possible.

## Commit to exercise

Eating healthier is a great first step to a healthier lifestyle but you can’t ignore the importance of exercise. You don’t have to be a gym-hopping fitness fanatic by any means but you should commit to doing something active every day — even if it’s just taking a walk or doing a few push-ups each day. This will help you stay healthy and will keep you feeling energized throughout the day.

There are many different types of exercise you can try. You can go for a run, lift some weights, do yoga, take a brisk walk, or anything else that gets your heart rate up. Exercise will not only help you burn calories but it can also help you sleep better and improve your mood.

## Don’t be afraid of healthy fats

Fats get a bad reputation but not all fats are bad. In fact, some are actually essential for good health, like the omega-3 found in salmon or walnuts. But fats in general get a bad rap because they are high in calories, which means people tend to avoid them as much as possible. This can lead to an unhealthy diet if you aren’t careful.

There are three main types of fat found in food — saturated fats, unsaturated fats, and trans fats — and they each have different effects on your health. While unsaturated fats are good for you, saturated fats aren’t entirely bad. Trans fats have been shown to have the most negative impact on your health.

## Final Words

When people think of eating healthy, they often think of it as a chore. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be a challenge, but it does require you to make certain dietary changes. What’s more, it’s not something that you can do for just a few weeks. Eating healthy is a lifestyle choice. And it’s one that can be achieved with a bit of planning and the right approach.
