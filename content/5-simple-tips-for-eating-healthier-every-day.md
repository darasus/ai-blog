## Stay Hydrated Every Day

One of the most important aspects of eating healthier every day is staying hydrated. In fact, many of the benefits of eating healthier – including better-looking skin and stronger hair – can be attributed to drinking more water. Drinking more water can also help you feel fuller faster, so it’s a great way to prevent overeating . You can also reap the benefits of water by making sure to drink it throughout the day. Avoid drinking water with your meals, as this can reduce the amount of enzymes your body can produce from your food.
For most people, drinking six to eight glasses of water every day is sufficient. You can also tell you’re hydrated enough by paying attention to your urine. If it’s light-colored – or even clear – you’re good to go. If it’s dark yellow, on the other hand, you need to drink some more water!

## Don’t Forget the Fruits and Veggies

At the very least, you should aim to eat two servings of fruits and veggies every day. If you can do more, then even better. Eating more fruits and veggies can help you achieve a number of health benefits – including lower blood pressure, reduced risk of certain cancers, reduced risk of heart disease, and more! When deciding what fruits and veggies to eat, remember that variety is the spice of life – so try to eat a variety of different ones. If you eat the same ones each day, you’ll likely miss out on some of the benefits of eating healthier.
Actually eating fruits and vegetables can be easier said than done, so make it easier on yourself with these tips:
- Cut up a fruit bowl to have on your counter or at your desk.
- Use vegetables to add flavor to other foods, such as dips or stir-fries.
- Prepare fruits and veggies in advance so they’re more accessible when you’re hungry.
- Pair fruits with other foods, such as yogurt or oatmeal.

## Watch Your Portions

As you probably know, many foods are high in sodium – including most processed foods, like crackers and chips, as well as condiments like soy sauce. Eating large amounts of these foods can make your daily sodium intake soar. Excess sodium can lead to higher blood pressure, which is one of the leading causes of heart disease.
While it’s important to keep an eye on your sodium intake, you shouldn’t avoid these foods altogether. Instead, focus on eating smaller portions of them and adding more fresh foods to your diet, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You can also try baking your own pizza or making homemade chips with a low-sodium baking soda recipe!

## Eat More Whole Grains

Whole grains, including oats, quinoa, and brown rice, are packed with vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. Unfortunately, most people don’t consume enough whole grains. If you want to eat healthier every day, this is one of the best places to start.

Whole grains are also high in fiber, which helps to keep your digestion regular and can even prevent certain cancers. Eating more whole grains is an easy way to add fiber to your diet without having to change your daily routine. You can easily add them to your morning breakfast, your afternoon snack, or even your dinner.

If you’re not sure where to start, try adding a grain-based dish to your daily meal plan. You can cook a large batch of rice or quinoa and store the rest for future meals. You can also try baking granola for a quick, healthy snack.

## Be Smart With your Proteins

If you want to eat healthier every day, you should try to eat more plant-based proteins and fewer animal-based proteins. Animal proteins are generally higher in fats and cholesterol, although they are also a great source of vitamin B12. If you don’t get enough B12 in your diet, your health can suffer as a result.
On the other hand, plant-based proteins are generally higher in fiber and minerals like iron. Plus, they’re a great source of vitamins, like vitamin C and vitamin E. By switching to more plant-based proteins, you’re likely to eat healthier every day.

## Conclusion

There are many benefits to eating healthier every day. You may even notice changes in your energy levels, skin, and hair. No matter what you eat or how much you change your diet, it’s not likely that you’ll notice a drastic change overnight. You should also remember that eating healthy isn’t about depriving yourself of the foods you love. It’s about making small changes every day to improve your health for the long haul.
