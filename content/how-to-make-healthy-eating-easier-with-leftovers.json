  "summary": "Eating your main meal and then having a small portion of leftovers for your next meal can help you get more nutrients in your diet without having to slave over a hot stove or blender. Eating leftovers can be a lifesaver if you have a chronic illness that makes it difficult for you to absorb nutrients from food. Eating more leftovers is actually healthier than eating fresh food, according to a study. Youâ€™re probably eating too much processed food and the more processed foods you eat, the harder it will be to meet your daily nutrient requirements. Using your food storage will make cooking feel less overwhelming.",
