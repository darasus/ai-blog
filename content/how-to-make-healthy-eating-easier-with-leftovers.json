  "summary": "Eating your main meal and then having a small portion of leftovers for your next meal can help you get more nutrients in your diet without having to slave over a hot stove or blender. Eating leftovers can be a lifesaver if you have a chronic illness that makes it difficult for you to absorb nutrients from food. Eating more leftovers is actually healthier than eating fresh food, according to a study. You’re probably eating too much processed food and the more processed foods you eat, the harder it will be to meet your daily nutrient requirements. Using your food storage will make cooking feel less overwhelming.",
  "intro": "Are you feeling so over-whelmed with the new year and its resolutions that you’ve decided to skip lunch for the foreseeable future? Or perhaps you’re just exhausted by how much effort it seems to take to eat healthy. While eating well isn’t as simple as following a diet — there are so many different factors that go into it, and we all have our own personal preferences when it comes to what makes a meal healthy. But, there are ways to make eating well a piece of cake. Leftovers are one of those ways! \nA meal made from scratch is an excellent way to ensure that you’re staying on track with your New Year’s resolutions. However, cooking every night is not realistic for most people. That doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy home-cooked meals without going through all the stressors of making them yourself – leftover cooking is your solution!",
  "content": "## Why should you care about leftovers?\n\nIf you’re anything like us, you’ve grown up hearing your parents’ voice in your head saying, “Waste not, want not.” This phrase is the key to making leftovers your go-to meal.\nLeftovers are one of the easiest ways to get more nutrients in your diet and make healthier eating easier. Even if you have a flawless diet plan, it’s almost impossible to hit all of your daily vitamins and minerals in one sitting.\nWe’re not as efficient at absorbing nutrients when we’re full and bloated from a large meal. Eating your main meal and then having a small portion of leftovers for your next meal can help you get more nutrients in your diet without having to slave over a hot stove or a blender.\n\n## You’re probably eating too much processed food\n\nIs your diet mainly comprised of boxed macaroni and cheese? This is a sign that you probably don’t have nearly enough leftovers in your life.\n\nWe’re not saying that you should never eat boxed mac and cheese again. What we’re saying is that you should get more of your daily nutrients from unprocessed foods.\nWe’re not saying that you should never eat boxed mac and cheese again. What we’re saying is that you should get more of your daily nutrients from unprocessed foods. The more processed foods you eat, the harder it will be to meet your daily nutrient requirements.\n\n## You might not be getting all of the nutrients you need\n\nAnother reason that you should be eating more leftovers is because it might not be as easy for you to get all of the nutrients that you need. If you have a chronic illness that makes it difficult for you to absorb nutrients from food, leftovers can be a lifesaver. If you have a condition that impacts your digestion, you might find that eating large meals gives you indigestion or makes you feel too full to eat again at a later time. This can make it seem nearly impossible to eat all of your recommended daily amounts.\nIf you’re eating all of your meals at once and aren’t getting the nutrients your body needs, you’re going to end up feeling exhausted, weak and sick. Eating a meal that includes leftovers can help you get more nutrients while avoiding feeling too bloated or full to eat again at a later time.\n\n## Using your food storage will make cooking feel less overwhelming\n\nIf you’re like most people struggling to eat healthier, you’re probably feeling pretty overwhelmed by what seems like an impossible number of vitamins and minerals that you have to get in each day. Even if you have a healthy meal plan, eating the same thing every day can get pretty boring.\nYou can use your food storage to make your diet more exciting and varied. Choose one or two meals that you can easily store in your fridge or pantry, and then use them to make different meals throughout the week.\nWorried that you won’t get enough nutrients if you’re not eating the same thing every day? There’s an app for that! There are many different nutrition tracking apps that can help you stay on top of your daily vitamins and minerals.\n\n## How to actually use your food storage for leftovers\n\nIf you’re like most people, you’ve got some food in your fridge that is getting close to its expiration date. Take advantage of this food to make easy meals with leftovers!\nFor example, broccoli is excellent at absorbing flavours. If you’ve got a broccoli stalk that’s about to get thrown out, try making broccoli and cheese for a quick and easy dinner.\nIf you have a baked chicken breast in your fridge and are craving something different, try using it to make a chicken salad. You can use your broccoli stalk, along with a few other unprocessed ingredients, to make a salad that’s quick and easy to eat.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAccording to a study, eating leftovers is actually healthier than eating fresh food. There are several reasons why eating leftovers can make healthy eating easier. You’re probably eating too much processed food, you might not be getting all of the nutrients you need, or cooking can feel too overwhelming. You can take advantage of your food storage to make quick and easy leftovers meals to eat during the week."
