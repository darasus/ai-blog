IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture.

It appears that it\\u2019s because these companies have found a new and innovative way to leverage technology to their advantage. These companies have been using blockchain technology as part of their growth strategy, and it\\u2019s working for them.\nThe popularity of the word \\u201Cblockchain\\u201D has grown substantially over the last couple of years.
