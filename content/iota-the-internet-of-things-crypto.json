It is a cryptocurrency used to execute transactions between devices on the IoT. IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle” The main advantage of the tangle architecture is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.",

As a result, businesses and consumers alike are recognizing the potential of Smart Technologies. Organizations are looking to implement new solutions that can streamline operations, cut costs, and drive innovation. In response to this growing demand for Smart Technology, blockchain is emerging as a promising solution.\nCrypto-currencies like Bitcoin have received a lot of attention recently because they use blockchain technology as their foundation \\u2013 something called a \\u201Cproof-of-work\\u201D mechanism that validates transactions on the network through verification by many different users.
