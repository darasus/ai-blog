It is a cryptocurrency used to execute transactions between devices on the IoT. IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle” The main advantage of the tangle architecture is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.",
