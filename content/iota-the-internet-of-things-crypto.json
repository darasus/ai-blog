  "summary": "IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger designed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is a cryptocurrency used to execute transactions between devices on the IoT. IOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle” The main advantage of the tangle architecture is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.",
  "intro": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices, sensors, software, and services that can connect directly with other devices. IoT technology is everywhere today – from your car to your television to even your refrigerator. \nThe IoT is made up of all the connected devices that monitor data such as operational parameters, performance, usage, etc. It allows users to interact with these connected devices through virtual applications or digital user interfaces.\nUsers and businesses can use the internet of things to track the locations of their assets, monitor usage patterns and detect problems before they become serious problems. This article explains why you should invest in Iota and its pros and cons as an investment opportunity.",

It is a cryptocurrency used to execute transactions between devices on the IoT.\nThe Internet of Things is a network of devices, sensors, software, and services that can connect directly with other devices. IoT technology is everywhere today – from your car to your television to even your refrigerator.\nThe Internet of Things is made up of all the connected devices that monitor data such as operational parameters, performance, usage, etc. It allows users to interact with these connected devices through virtual applications or digital user interfaces.\nIOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle.”\n\n## Why invest in Iota?\n\nIOTA has been designed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem. It is a scalable distributed ledger that enables Machine-to-Machine (M2M) transactions between IoT devices.\nIOTA is designed to be lightweight and scalable, with almost zero transaction fees. Therefore, it works better for small micro-payments between IoT devices as well as large payments between organizations\nIOTA has been backed by many industry giants like Microsoft, Bosch, Fujitsu, VW, and others. It has also partnered with other blockchain companies to integrate their services with IOTA.\nIOTA’s distributed ledger differs from blockchain distributed ledgers in that it doesn’t use a directed acyclic graph or DAG architecture. Instead, IOTA uses a directed cyclic graph architecture called a “tangle.”\nIOTA’s distributed ledger has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. Therefore, it can easily handle the high throughput requirements of IoT devices.\nIOTA is an open source distributed ledger and the company behind it is non-profit and open source. Therefore, it is not governed by any single organization or government.\n\n## IOTA Features\n\n- Scalability: IOTA has been designed to handle high throughput requirements of IoT devices. It can scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second.\n\n- Decentralized Network: IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices.\n\n- Zero Transaction Fees: IOTA has been designed for micro-payments between IoT devices. Therefore, it works better for small micro-payments between IoT devices as well as large payments between organizations.\n\n- Ease of use: IOTA has been designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Therefore, it works well with minimal hardware and software integration requirements.\n\n## IOTA Limitations\n\n- Centralization: IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices. However, it is technically not completely decentralized. It is partially centralized, as it has been designed to work under specific circumstances.\n\n- Open Source: IOTA is an open source distributed ledger, and the company behind it is non-profit and open source. Therefore, it is not governed by any single organization or government. However, its open source nature can be a disadvantage for some organizations.\n\n- Novel Architecture: IOTA has been designed with a novel architecture. Therefore, its long-term scalability and security are uncertain.\n\n- Security: IOTA’s distributed ledger has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. Therefore, it can easily handle the high throughput requirements of IoT devices. However, in the event of a security breach, it is uncertain how the distributed ledger will handle it.\n\n## The Tangle - Iota's Distributed Ledger\n\nThe tangle is IOTA’s distributed ledger architecture. It is a directed acyclic graph that has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second. The main advantage of the tangle architecture is that there are no transaction fees in IOTA.\nThe main drawback of the tangle architecture is that it is not as secure as a blockchain architecture like in Bitcoin. The tangle architecture is still in beta, and its long-term scalability and security are uncertain.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Is IOTA a cryptocurrency? Yes, IOTA is a cryptocurrency that has been designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.\n- What are the advantages of IOTA? IOTA has been designed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem. It is a scalable distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices.\n- What are the drawbacks of IOTA? IOTA is a decentralized distributed ledger that has been designed for the IoT ecosystem. It is a scalable distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices. However, it is not completely decentralized. It is partially centralized, as it has been designed to work under specific circumstances.\n- What is the current price of IOTA? As of mid-February 2019, the price of IOTA is $0.33.\n- What is the future of IOTA? IOTA is an open source distributed ledger and the company behind it is non-profit and open source. Therefore, it is not governed by any single organization or government. Its open source nature can be a disadvantage for some organizations. Its novel architecture is still in beta and has been designed to scale with the number of transactions per second. Its scalability and security are uncertain, and the distributed ledger architecture is still in its early stages. However, IOTA has been backed by many industry giants and has partnered with other blockchain companies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIOTA is a distributed ledger that has been designed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. It is a scalable distributed ledger that enables M2M transactions between IoT devices. IOTA’s distributed ledger architecture is a directed acyclic graph that has been designed to scale proportionally with the number of transactions per second."
