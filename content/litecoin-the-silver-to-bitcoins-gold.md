summary: Litecoin was created in 2011 as a “fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain. The
  network is able to produce 84 million Litecoin tokens compared to Bitcoin’s 21
  million. The most important difference between the two cryptocurrencies is
  their mining difficulty. Litecoin has a much smaller chance of increasing in
  value as dramatically as Bitcoin in the long run. There is also a higher rate
  of inflation for Litecoin, meaning that the value of each token will slowly
  decrease over time. The best place to buy and store Litecoin is in a digital
  wallet.
intro: >-
  At the time of this writing, there are over 1,300 cryptocurrencies in
  existence. That might sound like a lot, but it’s just a drop in the bucket
  compared to what we will see in future. As we enter into a new age of digital
  currencies and blockchain technology, we have seen an explosion of new tokens
  rise up to challenge old favorites like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

  Armed with the knowledge that many industries will inevitably adopt blockchain technology, developers have created their own unique solutions to accelerate adoption of this exciting new technology. While most of these coins are little more than experimental testnets for improving upon existing blockchains like Ethereum – others are legitimate competitors to the market leaders.

  Red hot at present is Litecoin – an alternative version of Bitcoin with some key differences. Let’s take a deeper look at how this newer cryptocurrency stacks up against its older brother...

## What is Litecoin?

Litecoin was created in 2011 as a “fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that Litecoin is an exact copy of the Bitcoin code, with a few modifications. The main intent behind Litecoin was to create a cryptocurrency that could be easily mined and used for daily commerce. While Bitcoin is too costly to be used for everyday purchases and has a slower network speed, Litecoin offers users a cheaper and quicker solution.
The Litecoin network offers a faster transaction speed and has a larger supply than Bitcoin. The network is able to produce 84 million Litecoin tokens compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. The Litecoin network is also capable of completing transactions with lower confirmation times than Bitcoin.

## How is Litecoin Different From Bitcoin?

The most important difference between the two cryptocurrencies is their mining difficulty. The mining difficulty is an algorithm that determines how much effort is required to find a new block. Mining difficulty is adjusted by the network to keep mining new blocks consistent. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining difficulty is very high, making it difficult to mine new blocks. This means that it can take days to confirm a transaction. With Litecoin, the mining difficulty is much lower, meaning transactions are confirmed much faster.
While the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, the supply of Litecoin is much higher at 84 million coins. This means that Litecoin has a much smaller chance of increasing in value as dramatically as Bitcoin in the long run. There is also a higher rate of inflation for Litecoin, meaning that the value of each token will slowly decrease over time.

## Why Does Litecoin Exist?

The main reason for the creation of Litecoin was a disagreement about the direction of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is an established network with a large network effect, there has always been debate about how it should be used.
One group of people believes that Bitcoin should be treated as digital gold – a rare commodity that should be saved and not spent. This group believes that Bitcoin should be used as a long-term investment and should be treated as a store of value. They also believe that Bitcoin should be mined using expensive hardware in order to make it difficult to attain.
Others believe that Bitcoin should be used as a digital cash system. This group believes that Bitcoin should be used for daily transactions and should be cheap enough to be used by the average person.
The creators of Litecoin believe that Bitcoin should be treated like digital cash. They believe that it should be cheap enough for the average person to use on a daily basis.

## How to Buy and Store Litecoin

As with many other cryptocurrencies, the best place to buy and store Litecoin is in a digital wallet. There are many different wallets available to store Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies. A popular option for storing Litecoin is using the LoafWallet, which is available for iOS and Android devices. LoafWallet is a mobile Litecoin wallet created by the Litecoin Foundation. LoAF is a great wallet for both beginners and experienced cryptocurrency traders.
If you’d prefer a more secure option, you can store your Litecoin in a hardware wallet like the Trezor. If you want to keep your cryptocurrency safe from hackers, you can choose a paper wallet. Paper wallets are an offline method of storing cryptocurrency that are printed out on a piece of paper.

## Should You Invest in Litecoin?

If you’ve read this far, it’s obvious that Litecoin is worth taking a closer look at. It’s important to remember that Litecoin is not a new technology that is unproven. Litecoin has been used as a cryptocurrency for over eight years and has a track record of success.
If you’re wondering if you should invest in Litecoin, the best way to go about it is to carefully consider the long-term value of Litecoin. Think about how Litecoin could be used in the future and how that might affect its price.
Litecoin has many advantages over Bitcoin including lower mining costs and transaction times. As more people start to realize that Litecoin is a better digital currency than Bitcoin, its popularity will likely increase. If Litecoin is used more frequently as a payment method, its price will likely increase as well.

## Conclusion

Litecoin is a cheaper and quicker version of Bitcoin that is intended for everyday transactions. Developers created Litecoin because they believed Bitcoin wasn’t cheap or quick enough for practical use.
Litecoin solves many of the issues that make Bitcoin undesirable, but it is often overlooked in favour of the more popular crypto token. This is unfortunate, because Litecoin offers a faster and cheaper way to transact that could one day challenge the status of fiat currencies like the dollar.
If you’re interested in investing in Litecoin, be sure to keep up to date with the latest news and developments. Doing so will help ensure you get the most out of your investment.
