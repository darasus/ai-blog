It\\u2019s also one of the most in-demand skills in the marketplace, with many businesses struggling to find developers with the right qualifications. The reason for this is that Java was the primary language for building the internet back in the 1990s. Because of this, software engineers who know Java are able to transfer their skills to work on cloud-computing platforms. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure all allow you to build cloud applications with Java.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"However, not all industries want Java coders. For example, an article in Computer World suggests that Java is \\u201Cnot relevant\\u201D to the healthcare industry.

It\\u2019s also worth considering that Python is a general-purpose language. This means that it\\u2019s used in a broad range of industries and applications.
