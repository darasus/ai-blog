According to a report from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Java is one of the most popular programming languages to build cloud applications. It\\u2019s also one of the most in-demand skills in the marketplace, with many businesses struggling to find developers with the right qualifications. The reason for this is that Java was the primary language for building the internet back in the 1990s. Because of this, software engineers who know Java are able to transfer their skills to work on cloud-computing platforms. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure all allow you to build cloud applications with Java.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"However, not all industries want Java coders. For example, an article in Computer World suggests that Java is \\u201Cnot relevant\\u201D to the healthcare industry. There are also some modern languages that are better suited to emerging technologies. Although Java is a great language to start off with, you may want to consider moving on to something more suitable once you get some experience.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Python\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Python is another programming language that you might want to consider. This is a general-purpose language that is used in many different industries. According to a report from the CNCF, Python is one of the top five most used languages for cloud computing. In fact, Python was the language that AWS was initially built with. Moreover, Python is one of the most popular languages for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. There are a couple of good reasons for this. Firstly, Python has the maturity to handle complex app development. Secondly, it has the flexibility to be applied to a broad range of problems.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you start learning Python, you\\u2019re in a good position to move into AI development. As many businesses move towards AI-based solutions, the demand for Python developers will continue to grow. Python has been a popular language for many years, and it\\u2019s likely to continue to be a top choice for many years to come. It\\u2019s also worth considering that Python is a general-purpose language. This means that it\\u2019s used in a broad range of industries and applications. In contrast, there are also specific-purpose languages that are used for a limited number of tasks.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"JavaScript\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You may have heard of JavaScript, but it\\u2019s important to realize that it\\u2019s an evolving language. New versions come out regularly, and JavaScript is now at version 8. The language has gone through many changes over the years, but it\\u2019s still one of the most popular languages in the world. It\\u2019s also a very versatile language, being used for front-end web development as well as server-side development.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best part about JavaScript is that it\\u2019s used in both front-end website and back-end server development. This means that JavaScript developers can work on a wide range of projects. The downside is that there are many different versions of the language, which can make it difficult to find work. You may need to specialize in a particular version of JavaScript if you want to find a job.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Android\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Android is an open-source operating system that has been built for mobile devices. It was originally created by Google and was released in 2008. This operating system has been developed by a group of companies, including Google, Huawei, Samsung, and LG. There are also many apps that can be used with Android and are available for download.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Android is another language that is used for mobile devices. In fact, it has become the most popular operating system for smartphones. This means that there are many companies in need of Android developers and designers. Android is also a growing language in the world of software development. Many tech experts are now predicting that Android will become the largest operating system in the world.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Kotlin\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Kotlin is a programming language that was created by a group of engineers at a company called JetBrains. This company is based in St. Petersburg, Russia. The engineers who worked on Kotlin wanted to create a modern language that would be easier to use than Java. They also wanted Kotlin to be interoperable with Java, which means that you can use both languages together.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Kotlin is another modern programming language that you may want to consider. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, mainly thanks to its ease of use and interoperability with Java. There are also many tech companies that are now using Kotlin, including Pinterest and Uber. The demand for Kotlin developers is expected to increase in the years ahead, making it a good career choice.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In conclusion, the best way to figure out which languages are in demand is to look at job listings. Once you have some experience, you can start applying for jobs and see what skills are in demand. The best way to become a successful coder is to choose a language that you enjoy and then to practice as much as you can. You\\u2019re not going to become an expert overnight, but if you keep learning and practicing, you will get there.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
