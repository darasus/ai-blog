  Expert gamers are a finicky bunch. They love getting their game-on, but
  they also have exacting standards when it comes to the games they play. That’s
  why there are so many expert-friendly video games out there today. But that’s
  also why it can be so hard to find an expert-friendly title in general. 

  Experts want games with a variety of challenges and objectives that demand strategy, not just reaction time or hand-eye coordination. They want graphics and sounds that aren’t juvenile but instead sophisticated and immersive. And most importantly, they want to play against other experts rather than casual gamers who keep asking “Red or blue?”

  So if you think you have what it takes to make this list of the top expert games of 2018, check out these top-tier titles for some expert-level fun:

## Hearthstone

Hearthstone is one of the most popular collectible card games of all time, and this year it got a major makeover. The game’s new “Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft” graphics engine is more lifelike than ever, and all of its core mechanics have been retooled to make them smoother and more intuitive.
The result is a game that expert CCG gamers can’t get enough of. They praise Hearthstone’s variety of playstyles and card types, as well as its deep and challenging “ladder” multiplayer mode. What’s more, the game’s new graphics engine serves up expertly rendered visuals that are so lifelike, you can almost smell the dust on the cards.

## Dark Souls: Remastered

Dark Souls is one of the most challenging games ever made, and this remastered version is even harder. But if you’re an expert gamer, that’s a good thing. Dark Souls experts love the game’s punishing difficulty and incredibly demanding “softcore” multiplayer mode. They also appreciate the game’s updated graphics engine, which is more visually impressive than ever thanks to modern rendering techniques and better texture resolution.

If you’re a masochistic expert gamer, check out this remastered version of the infamous Dark Souls to experience one of the most challenging expert games on the market.

## Mario Tennis Aces

Mario Tennis Aces is an expert-friendly tennis simulation, with a few notable gameplay variations. First, the game has a “special shots” mechanic that lets players unleash supercharged tennis shots with a well-placed button tap. Second, the game has a “scoreboard” mode where two players compete to take out as many tennis balls as possible in a limited time. Both of these variations make the game more challenging and fun, and they make it accessible to both experts and casual gamers alike.

Moreover, Mario Tennis Aces has one of the best-looking graphics engines of any tennis simulation game. It uses a special graphics technology called “real-time photogrammetry” to render lifelike visuals that look almost like 3D renders. That makes this game a one-of-a-kind expert-friendly experience.

## God of War

God of War is one of the most highly anticipated expert games of the past few years, and it delivers on every expectation. This action-adventure game has a compact but challenging campaign, gorgeous lifelike visuals, and a unique combat system that’s both visceral and strategic.
In short, God of War is everything an expert gamer could want in a game. It has a rewarding narrative, challenging boss fights, and a “special attacks” mechanic that lets players use the environment to their advantage.

What’s more, the game’s new engine has some of the best lighting effects we’ve ever seen. It makes the game’s lush environments even more lifelike and immersive than ever before.

## Shadow of the Colossus

This action-adventure expert game is one of the most visually stunning games ever made, and it’s even more impressive now that it’s been remastered. The game uses a special “Bluepoint Engine” to render lifelike visuals that are almost photorealistic in some cases.
This engine also makes the game’s expansive and immersive environments look more realistic than ever before, which is perfect for an expert-friendly game like Shadow of the Colossus.

To top it off, this remastered version of the game has smoother animations, an enhanced artificial intelligence for enemies, and a more intuitive control scheme for button inputs.

## Marvel's Spider-Man

This action-adventure expert game has a lot going for it. It has an open-world map that’s as large and immersive as any expert gamer could want. It also has a challenging campaign, smooth and intuitive controls, and a special “spider sense” mechanic that lets you dodge attacks with ease.
And on top of all that, this game has incredible visuals that are some of the best we’ve ever seen. The game uses a special “Insomniac Engine” to render lifelike photorealistic visuals with an almost uncanny level of detail.

## Red Dead Redemption II

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the most anticipated expert games of the decade, and it’s finally here. This open-world expert game is crammed with content, including expansive sandbox maps and a robust multiplayer mode. It also has a unique “Dead Eye” targeting system and a “rules of the wild” mechanic that lets you influence the game world in surprising ways.
It even has lifelike visuals, thanks to NVIDIA RTX ray-tracing technology that makes light bend and bounce properly in a way that’s never been seen before. And if all of that isn’t enough for you, this game also has a “first-person” mode that lets you experience it from a whole new perspective.

## Conclusion

As you can see from this list, there are plenty of expert-level games out there. And while they might not be as accessible as the casual games you’re used to, they’re certainly worth the extra effort. After all, expert games are designed to challenge you in new and interesting ways. They’re meant to push you out of your comfort zone and make you a better gamer in the process.
And while some of these games have been out since the start of the year, others are brand-new releases that give expert gamers a whole new world of challenges and excitement.
