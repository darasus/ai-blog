  You can’t open a magazine or social media feed these days without seeing
  something about the organic food movement. In fact, the organic food market is
  growing faster than any other segment of the food industry. According to the
  Organic Trade Association, sales of organic foods increased by almost 10% in
  2017 alone. And given that more and more consumers are becoming aware of what
  they’re eating and where it comes from, that isn’t going to change anytime
  soon. Which begs the question: Are all those new organic options worth it? Do
  they really taste better than conventional alternatives? Are they healthier
  for you? And most importantly, is the cost worth it? 

  If you read through all the information on different types of organic foods and their benefits, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed right now. That’s totally normal! But don’t fret—we have you covered with everything you need to know about whether or not organic is worth its hefty price tag.

## How do you know if an Organic Food is really Organic?

There are a couple of things to look for when determining whether or not a food is truly organic: A Certified Organic logo - The first thing you should look for is a certified organic label. That way you can be sure that it’s truly organic. A “Natural” label - If you see “natural” on the label, that means there’s no third-party certification. That doesn’t mean the product isn’t organic, but it’s worth researching the brand to find out for sure. Organic ingredients - Organic means “grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, genetic engineering, or ionizing radiation.” That means the ingredient list should only contain items that are organic, so you could check it out to find out for sure.

## Is Organic Food Worth the Cost?

This is the $64,000 question, right? In a word, yes. But let’s break down why that is. Organic vs. conventional farming - Conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, including chemical sprays that can be harmful to humans. While some of these pesticides can be helpful in small doses, many can be dangerous. Organic farming, on the other hand, uses natural fertilizers and promotes biodiversity to fight pests naturally. This means that organic crops are less likely to be tainted with harmful chemicals.
Conventional produce - Many conventional fruits and vegetables are grown in highly fluorescent lights, which can be very harmful to the environment. Because of this, they aren’t as nutritious as they could be. Additionally, they may be sprayed with pesticides that can be harmful to you and your family. Organic produce - Organic produce is grown with fewer pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and to you and your family. And because it’s grown in more natural conditions, it’s more nutritious.
Conventional dairy - Most conventional dairy cows are raised on factory farms where they’re fed grain instead of grass. When cows aren’t let out in pastures to graze and forage for their food, their diet can be imbalanced. This means that the cows aren’t as healthy as they could be and the dairy they produce might not be as nutritious. Organic dairy - Organic dairy cows are raised on smaller farms that allow them to graze on pastures. Because of this, their diet is more balanced and their dairy is more nutritious.
Conventional meat - Conventional meat is often raised on large factory farms that use antibiotics and hormones to speed up the process. These meats are often tainted with these chemicals, and are less safe to eat. Organic meat - Organic meats are often raised on smaller farms that don’t use antibiotics or hormones to speed up the process.
Conventional coffee - Conventional coffee beans are often sprayed with harmful pesticides that can be very harmful to you when you drink them. Organic coffee - Organic coffee beans are grown without pesticides.
Conventional wheat - The wheat that conventional farmers grow is often genetically modified (GM) to be resistant to pests and diseases. Organic wheat - Organic wheat is not genetically modified (GM).
Conventional rice - Conventional rice often is grown with pesticides that can be harmful to you when you eat it. Organic rice - Organic rice is not grown with pesticides.

## Are organic foods more nutritious?

This one is a tricky question. While organic foods are generally thought to be more nutritious than conventional foods, research has shown that the difference between organic and conventional foods is very small. This isn’t to say that organic foods aren’t worth the extra money, but it is worth keeping in mind that the nutritional difference between the two is likely very small.

Organic foods are, however, worth the money for other reasons. They are grown without synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which means that they’re better for the environment. They’re also less likely to contain trace amounts of pesticides, since those pesticides aren’t sprayed on crops.

Organic foods also often come from smaller farms that are more likely to pass inspection by the National Organic Program.

## Are organic foods safer to eat?

Organic foods tend to contain fewer pesticides than conventional foods, which means they are safer to eat. This is especially important if you have small children or are pregnant, since pesticides can be harmful to growing bodies.

Organic foods also tend to have higher nutritional content than other foods, which can help keep you healthy.

Since organic foods often come from smaller farms that are less likely to pass inspection by the National Organic Program, they’re also less likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria.

## Should you buy organic meat, eggs, and dairy?

Yes! While the benefits of organic produce are important and worth the extra cost, the benefits of organic meat, eggs, and dairy are even more important. When buying any type of animal product, you want to make sure it’s organic.
Conventional meat, eggs, and dairy often come from farms that use antibiotics and hormones to speed up production. These substances are meant to help the animals grow faster and stronger, but they can be harmful to humans. Organic meat, eggs, and dairy are less likely to be tainted with harmful antibiotics and hormones.

## Final Words

Organic food is better for you, the environment, and the animals you eat. Plus, you’ll feel better knowing that you’re eating food that was grown and raised as naturally as possible. The trick is to find ways to make it fit into your budget and make sure it stays on your grocery list.
