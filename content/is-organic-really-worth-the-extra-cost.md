## Organic Foods are More Nutritious

One of the primary reasons for choosing organic produce is that it is nutritionally superior to its conventional counterpart.

One study compared a wide range of fruits and vegetables in terms of their nutrient content, and found that organically grown apples, strawberries, carrots, spinach, corn, potatoes, bell peppers, and pears had significantly higher amounts of antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, than conventionally grown apples, strawberries, carrots, spinach, corn, potatoes, bell peppers, and pears.

The study also found that organically grown apples had 50% higher amounts of phenolic acid than conventionally grown apples, and that organically grown strawberries had almost three times as much phenolic acid as conventionally grown strawberries.

The study also found that organically grown spinach had almost twice as much iron as conventionally grown spinach, and that organically grown spinach had almost three times as much copper as conventionally grown spinach.

The study concluded that organically grown produce is more nutritious in general.

## Safer Food for you and your family

Organic foods are grown without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, which means they're less likely to cause health problems such as asthma, headaches, or gastrointestinal issues. This is significant because many conventional foods are sprayed with toxic pesticides, which can be harmful to your health. Additionally, farming with synthetic fertilizers creates nitrous oxide, which is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Organic food is produced with natural fertilizers and organic pesticides, which are less harmful to your health and the environment. However, some people choose organic foods to avoid genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are sometimes used as fertilizers, even though only non-GMO organic fertilizers are permitted in organic farming. GMOs are a controversial topic, so this is definitely something to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to buy organic food.

## GMO Content of Organics

Some people choose organic foods to avoid genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are sometimes used as fertilizers, even though only non-GMO organic fertilizers are permitted in organic farming. GMOs are a controversial topic, so this is definitely something to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to buy organic food.

Overall, there is no evidence that consuming GM crops is harmful to human health. A number of large-scale, long-term studies have shown that GM crops are as safe and nutritious as their non-GM counterparts, and that they pose no greater risk to the environment.

## Disadvantages of Going Organic

- Price: Organic foods are more expensive than non-organic foods - as much as 20% more expensive. Depending on your income and family size, this difference may make it difficult to afford a predominantly organic diet. However, you can still enjoy the health benefits of organic foods by choosing them occasionally or purchasing them in smaller quantities.
- Quality: There is no evidence that organic foods are more nutritious than non-organic foods. In fact, some studies have found that conventionally grown produce may be more nutritious than organics.
- Food quality: While organically grown foods do not contain pesticides, they may contain less nutrients than conventionally grown foods due to lower soil quality and less-favorable weather conditions.
- Environmental impact: Agriculture is predicted to be one of the main drivers of climate change, so the environmental impact of different farming practices is important to consider. Although organic farming practices can reduce carbon emissions, they require more land and water than conventional methods, which could lead to deforestation and water shortages.
- Animal welfare: Organic farming does not always meet the same animal welfare standards as non-organic farming.
- Food security: Conventionally grown crops may provide a greater amount of food per unit of land, which may be necessary as the worldâ€™s population continues to grow.

## Final Words: Is organic worth the extra cost?

Some people choose to buy organic foods because they believe they are healthier than non-organic foods. Others buy organic foods because they prefer the taste or because they want to support sustainable farming practices. Regardless of your reasons for choosing to eat organic, the fact remains that organic food is more expensive than non-organic food.

Are you willing to spend more money on organic food in exchange for better health benefits and sustainable farming practices? If so, then you should go ahead and make the switch to organic. If not, then you can stick to buying non-organic foods and save some money.

Unfortunately, no research has conclusively shown that eating a predominantly organic diet provides any health benefits beyond eating a predominantly non-organic diet. On the other hand, eating a predominantly non-organic diet does come with some health risks.
