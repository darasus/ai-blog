The best network administrators manage to plan for the future by anticipating problems from the present and creating plans to deal with them before they arise. However, this can be difficult when working in a fast-paced industry with so much change happening at once.\nIn response to this challenge, Go\\u2014a simple programming language developed by Google that makes it easier to create software packages\\u2014is gaining traction as an ideal tool for creating programs for operating and managing computer networks. Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques. If you\\u2019re interested in using Go to make your career as a network administrator easier or even transition into becoming one, read on for more information about why you should learn Go for Network Administration and the best places to get started with your learning today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
