Even the field of programming is shifting towards more digitized platforms and solutions. In such a scenario, the need for compact programs that can be easily installed and used on any device arises. That\\u2019s where Java packages come into play.\nA package in java is a collection of related classes, interfaces, enumerations, and sub-packages under one umbrella. As you may have already understood from the above explanation, packages are a great way to organize your code into logical units that can be reused across projects. Packages help you avoid naming conflicts with other libraries or programs and help keep related things together so they\\u2019re easier to find later on. Let\\u2019s take a look at some common Java packages:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Part of the power of Java comes from the fact that it is a high-level language that can run on almost any hardware.\nThis means that you can write code once and run it almost anywhere. It also means that you have to be careful about how you organize your code so it can be reused.\nThis is where Java packages come in.\nBy grouping related classes and sub-packages into a single definition and name space, you can make your code easier to understand and reuse.
