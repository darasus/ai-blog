  Putting healthy food on the table every night can be a challenge for many
  parents. It’s hard to get kids excited about eating their vegetables, but
  luckily there are plenty of tricks that make it easier.

  Addressing their senses is a good place to start. The sense of smell and taste are the primary drivers of our desire to eat one thing or another. Kids love things that look, smell, feel and taste good. The trick is finding ways to incorporate these elements into nutritious meals so they want to eat them.

  One way parents have been able to do this is by using smoothies as an opportunity to add hidden veggies into their kid’s diets without them knowing it. And, since you’ll be using green smoothies as the base for your drink—not just any old sweet smoothie—it won’t add any sugar or calories that you don’t want in there.

## Why Kids Don’t Like Veggies

Kids are not born disliking vegetables. In fact, they are born loving them. It’s only after years of hearing “eat your veggies” that they start to resent eating them. This happens for a few reasons. Kids associate vegetables with being told to do something and not having the freedom to choose when or how much to eat them. This causes them to resent eating them, which makes them not want to eat them.
Kids also dislike vegetables because they aren’t prepared in ways that are enjoyable for them. You can’t just feed them raw broccoli and expect them to love it. They need to be presented in a way that gets them excited about eating them. This means finding ways to prepare vegetables that are both tasty and enjoyable for them to eat.

## How to Make a Green Smoothie for Your Kid

Once you’ve chosen which ingredients you want to put into your green smoothie, the next step is to blend them up. If you have a blender with a large capacity, use it, but keep in mind that you may need to chop up some of your ingredients if they’re too big. If you have a smaller blender, use a food processor or hand blender.

Once your smoothie is blended, pour it into a bowl and add in any toppings you want like crumbled cookies, granola, nuts, seeds, dried fruit or coconut flakes. This will give your smoothie a fun appearance that kids will want to eat.

## Add Spirulina and Chlorella

Spirulina and chlorella are two types of algae that are rich in minerals, vitamins and many other nutrients that your body needs. These algae also contain protein, which makes them a great addition to a green smoothie that kids will want to drink.

If a smoothie isn’t appealing to your child, adding a scoop of spirulina or chlorella powder to their favourite food is another way to add this veggie boost to their diet. You can add it to oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, pancakes, muffins, cookies and more.

## Add Fruit

Fruits like berries, apples, oranges, mangoes and bananas are loaded with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. These delicious fruits are the perfect way to get your kids excited about eating their vegetables.

If you add fruit to the top of your green smoothie, it will bleed into the green colour. This turns your smoothie into a purple smoothie that kids may not want to drink. If you’re adding fruit to the bottom of your smoothie, your drink will be green. If you’re adding fruit to the top of your smoothie, make sure to blend it until it’s liquefied so it doesn’t leave chunks at the top of the glass.

## Add Dark Leafy Greens

Kale, spinach, Swiss chard and other dark leafy greens are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. These are the perfect ingredients to add to a green smoothie that will help kids get all the nutrients they need without even knowing it.

If you choose to add these greens to the top of your smoothie, make sure to blend them until they’re liquefied so there are no chunks left behind. If you want your smoothie to look green, add the greens to the bottom of the blender so they don’t get blended up.

## Adding Hidden Veggies: Broccoli, Spinach, Beets and more.

If you want to give your kids a nutritious boost but don’t want them to know they’re drinking their veggies, here are some good ingredients to add to your green smoothie: broccoli, spinach, radishes, beets, carrots and bell peppers.

These veggies blend up well in a green smoothie and you won’t be able to taste them. If you’re adding them to the top of your smoothie, make sure to blend them until they’re liquefied and they don’t leave behind any chunks. If you want your smoothie to look green, add these ingredients to the bottom of the blender.

## Conclusion

Creating the perfect green smoothie for your kid isn’t difficult if you know what to put in it. The trick is to put nutritious ingredients into a drink that kids will love. This will get them excited about drinking their veggies, which will help them get the nutrients they need.

Kids these days want sugar and flavour in everything they eat. If you can find a way to sneak nutrients into their favourite drinks and foods, you’ll be doing them a favour and helping them grow up to be healthy adults.
