Anxiety is a normal emotion that we all experience at one point or another. It's a feeling of unease, worry or fear. We may feel anxious about an upcoming event, such as a job interview, or about something that is happening in our lives, such as financial problems.

There are different types of anxiety disorders, each with their own symptoms. Some of the most common include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias.

Anxiety can be mild and short-lived, or it can be severe and long-lasting. It can also lead to physical symptoms, such as a racing heart, sweating and trembling.

If you're feeling anxious, there are a number of things you can do to help yourself feel better. Here are some tips:

• Identify your triggers: What situations or events make you feel anxious? If you can avoid them, do so. If you can't, try to prepare for them in advance.

• Challenge your thoughts: When you're feeling anxious, your thoughts can be negative and unrealistic. Challenge these thoughts by asking yourself if there is evidence to support them.

• Relax: There are a number of relaxation techniques you can try, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation.

• Exercise: Exercise can help to reduce stress and release endorphins, which can improve your mood.

• Talk to someone: Talking to a friend, family member, therapist or counselor can help you to understand and manage your anxiety.
