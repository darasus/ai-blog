Sure, you can code in multiple programming languages fluently, debug any issues you encounter, and implement algorithms like a pro. But what happens when your code crashes again and again? Or it works perfectly on paper but not in practice? What do you do when you have no idea what\\u2019s going wrong or why the code isn\\u2019t working as intended? Well, if that sounds like you \\u2014 as a programmer \\u2014 then keep reading because we have some good news for you! Debugging your code is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks as a coder. It requires patience, precision, and analytical skills to identify where things aren\\u2019t working correctly and why. However, with the right strategies and techniques, debugging your code doesn\\u2019t need to be a painful process.
