Films like \\u201CSelma\\u201D are necessary to remind viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Alejandro Gonz\\xE1lez I\\xF1\\xE1rritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
