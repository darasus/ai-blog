Monsters, ghosts and psychotic killers are no longer frightening, so viewers instead get the same story with a different setting, characters and victim every time. The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days. From vampires to werewolves to Frankenstein\\u2019s monster and his re-imagined counterpart, Victor Frankenstein, there isn\\u2019t much left that hasn\\u2019t already been done multiple times before. In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts. But then again\\u2026 The Babadook doesn\\u2019t exactly follow the same formulaic structure either.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Nora\\u2019s light-skinned daughter falls for local boy Harry (Swayze), who does not know she also has darker blood.
