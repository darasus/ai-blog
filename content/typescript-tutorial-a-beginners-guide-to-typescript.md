intro: >-
  If you’ve been following the world of programming for the past couple of
  years, you have probably heard about TypeScript by now. This is because it’s
  one of the most interesting and accessible ways to get started with modern
  programming languages. Since its release in 2014, TypeScript has become
  extremely popular among developers from all over the world, including those
  who usually avoid any new software or tools that are still in beta testing
  phase. 

  This article will cover everything you need to know about TypeScript and why exactly this language has caught the attention of so many programmers. It also includes a list of tutorials on how to get started with TypeScript as fast as possible so that you can use it effectively in your future projects as well.

## What Is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular language used in the development process of web applications and websites. You will often find it in front-end web development, mobile app development, and IoT development as well. So, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. In other words, it is a programming language that can be compiled into JavaScript. TypeScript can be used to develop any kind of application, but it is most commonly used for web development.

A lot of modern programming languages like C#, Java, and Go have static typing. This means that the type of data is determined before the program is executed. This is not the case with JavaScript. This language expects the user to specify the data types at runtime, which can make the code less accurate and more prone to bugs. TypeScript solves this issue by adding static typing to the JavaScript language.

## How Does TypeScript Work?

Let’s go over how TypeScript works. First, you will write code in a TypeScript file. Then, you will use a TypeScript compiler to generate JavaScript code. You can then run the generated JavaScript code in any browser or environment. When the TypeScript compiler compiles your code, it uses an online service such as an integrated development environment (IDE) or a cloud-based service. This is a great way to start using TypeScript since you don’t have to download and install any software.

The TypeScript compiler analyses your code, then it compiles it into a regular JavaScript code. However, when you run the code, it will use a JavaScript engine to execute it. This means that static typing works only when the code is being compiled. In other words, the type annotations will not be available when the code executes.

## Why Should You Use TypeScript?

There are several reasons why you should use TypeScript. First, it lets you choose between dynamic and static typing. Using static typing, you can write more accurate code because the compiler will check it and indicate errors as soon as you make a mistake. On the other hand, if you use dynamic typing, you can write more intuitive code that is easier to understand.

Second, static typing can help you avoid bugs and improve your development process. Debugging is often much easier when the code is compiled with static typing since the compiler will automatically check for typos and errors.

Finally, static typing makes it much easier to scale up your projects and create code libraries that other developers can use as well.

## The Advantages of Using TypeScript

The advantages of using TypeScript are numerous. First, it is a simple way to start using static typing. If you usually write code without any type annotations, you will find that adding types to your projects is straightforward. This is because TypeScript lets you use a simple syntax to add types to your code.

Second, it is an open-source language that is also free to use. By using an open-source language, you can make sure that the code is secure and safe to use. You also have access to the source code and can modify it to suit your needs if necessary.

Third, TypeScript is supported by all major IDEs, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Vim. This makes it easy to integrate TypeScript into your development process and use it for your future projects.

## Wrapping Up

Now that you know what TypeScript is and how it works, you can decide if it’s a good choice for your next project. TypeScript is a great language for beginners and experienced developers alike. It lets you write more accurate code that is easier to debug and scale up. It also allows you to choose between static and dynamic typing so that you can create an intuitive code that is easier to understand.

If you have been looking for a new language to try out, or you want to upgrade your skills and move up to the next level, TypeScript is the best choice. It is a modern and powerful language that can be combined with lots of different tools, libraries, and frameworks. It is also easy to integrate with other languages and it is supported by all major IDEs.
