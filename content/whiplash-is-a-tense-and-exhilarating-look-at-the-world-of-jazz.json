Films like \\u201CSelma\\u201D are necessary to remind viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

Lewis, also known as \\u201Cthe Lion of Selma\\u201D \\u2013 a prominent civil rights leader who had grown up there after his family fled Greenwood as part of the Great Migration from 1916-1921. In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Alejandro Gonz\\xE1lez I\\xF1\\xE1rritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory.\nThis is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it\\u2019s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse \\u2014 instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.\nA few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete \\u2018A Brief History of Time\\u2019 which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold. In 2014, the film \\u2018The Theory of Everything\\u2019 was released based on the book by Jane Hawking about her marriage with Stephen which further cemented his fame as one of the most brilliant minds in history today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Films like \\u201CMad Max\\u201D and \\u201CThe Road Warrior\\u201D were cautionary tales about the future of mankind brought on by a series of devastating natural and man-made disasters; \"Mad Max\" being set during a prolonged drought, and \"The Road Warrior\" taking place after a catastrophic failure of an oil refinery leads to widespread pollution and destruction as well as a shortage of gasoline (which is what inspired the term \\u201CRoad Warrior\\u201D).\nIn these movies, there are also factions that have arisen to take advantage of these new conditions: In \"Mad Max\", we see gangs whose primary function is to steal fuel from other scavenger tribes; In \"The Road Warrior\", we see roving bands that are essentially highwaymen that prey upon small towns using their road-warrior combat skillset; And in both movies we see heroes who fight against evil not because they want to be evil but because they are good people trying to save those they love in terrible times.\nThese subtexts have been explored time and time again throughout history through literature such as The Bible`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
