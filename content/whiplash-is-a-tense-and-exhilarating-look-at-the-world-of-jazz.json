The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before. In fact, it can be incredibly exciting when musicians dig into who they were as teenagers, young adults and beyond.\nIf you need convincing, just take a listen to Foster the People\\u2019s latest album \\u2013 \\u2018Sacred Hearts Club\\u2019 \\u2013 which is Led Zeppelin meets Weezer with hints of Pink Floyd and other psychedelic influences. Here are five reasons why this LP is proof positive that going back home is the perfect way for any artist to get inspired again.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
