  "summary": "The sound mix on this film is something to behold. J.K. Simmons plays the ruthless Terence Fletcher, the \"bad-ass motherfucker\" who heads up the jazz program at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory of Music at New York University. Even when the film is not focusing on the drums, the cinematography is just gorgeous. It's a story that is as much about toxic, abusive relationships as it is about relationships that are worth fighting for and fighting for. The Verdict is unquestionably, the best film released in 2014, if you're a fan of jazz or a student of the art of performance.",

It's also a film about performance, but it's not a concert movie. It is, however, an electrifying and exhilarating portrait of the world of jazz drumming: its practice; its professors; its players; its perfectionists. It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
