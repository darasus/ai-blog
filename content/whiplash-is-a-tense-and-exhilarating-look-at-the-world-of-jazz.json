This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

He would go on to become a war hero, pioneer of computer science, and one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
