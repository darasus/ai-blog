  "intro": "When it comes to eating out, the humble pizza remains one of the most popular meal choices. After all, who doesn’t like a hot, cheesy, gooey personal-sized pie? But with so many fast-food and casual chains offering their own versions of this classic dish, it can be hard to know where to find the best pizza when you want it. Luckily, thanks to rising demand for home delivery and takeout services as well as growing interest in gourmet cooking and home-delivery meal kit services such as Blue Apron, home-cooked pizzas are easier than ever to make at home. And whether you favor red sauce or white sauce; classic Italian toppings or something more exotic; traditional thin crust or super thick pan or even cauliflower crust – this guide will show you how.",
  "content": "## What’s the secret to a great home-cooked pizza?\n\nThere are many secrets to cooking a great pizza at home, but the most important of all is getting the crust right. The best pizzas are made with a thin crust that’s chewy, crispy, and slightly oily on the outside, but soft and tender inside. A good pizza dough will also have just the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor of other ingredients. To make the perfect pizza dough, you’ll need to mix up a batch of bread or pizza dough. To get the best results, you’ll need to combine all the dry ingredients and then add in the wet ingredients. The most important thing you can do is knead the dough well. You should knead it until it’s soft and smooth, but not sticky. If you knead the dough long enough, it will go from a sticky, rough texture to a smooth, silky texture.\n\n## Equipment you’ll need for the best home pizza making\n\nIf you’re serious about making great pizzas at home, you’ll need to invest in the right equipment. Besides the basics such as a chef’s knife and a cutting board, you’ll need a food processor and a stand mixer, plus a baking sheet, baking stone, pizza stone, rolling pin, and pizza cutter. A pizza peel is another handy piece of equipment to have, but it’s not essential."
