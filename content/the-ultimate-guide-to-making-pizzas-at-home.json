In addition to this, there is no singular answer or solution to reversing the effects of pollution on our home planet; rather, it will require an amalgamation of many different initiatives working together simultaneously.\nOne such initiative is veganism. A plant-based diet has a number of positive benefits on the environment \\u2014 mainly because raising livestock produces a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. If we all stopped eating meat it would have a huge effect on carbon dioxide levels, deforestation rates, and natural water courses.\nAs you\\u2019ll discover from reading this article, veganism could be the answer to climate change; however, there are also some drawbacks.
