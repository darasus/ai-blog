In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software! In this article we will be exploring Bitcoin forks: More specifically, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, there are plenty of other skills that will be even more valuable in the coming years, such as the ability to use emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlmost everyone has heard about blockchain technology thanks to its usage in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . But what exactly is blockchain technology? A blockchain is a digital ledger that allows users to make secure transactions without the need for a third party or intermediary such as a bank or broker.\nLet\\u2019s take a look at some examples of how you can use blockchain technology for development either now or in the future.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
