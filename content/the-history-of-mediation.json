It started out as a tool for resolving labor disputes, but soon became popular in other areas of dispute resolution as well. A Swiss man named Ferdinand G. Ph.

When it comes to resolving conflict in business relationships, mediation is one of the most effective strategies. The type of mediation process you use will depend on the needs and interests of the parties. Here are some common types of mediation processes you may come across:  Traditional mediation. This is the classic mediation process, where the parties sit down with a mediator, who asks them questions, facilitates communication, and guides them in finding a solution. This is a flexible process, but it does depend on the parties being able to communicate directly with each other. Mediational inquiry. This is a type of mediation process that is somewhat similar to a court trial, where an impartial mediator asks the parties questions to determine the facts of the dispute and their interests. The mediator then uses this information to help the parties resolve their dispute. This process is very structured and is often used in legal mediation. Holistic mediation.

Many corporations and nonprofit organizations negotiate group discounts when contracting with third-party mediation services.
