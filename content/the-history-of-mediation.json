The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequence. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It\\u2019t win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their dispute.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer these services pro bono publico, which means \\u201Cfor the good of the public\\u201D without charge.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.
