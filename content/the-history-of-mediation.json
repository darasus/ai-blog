This is a flexible process, but it does depend on the parties being able to communicate directly with each other. Mediational inquiry. This is a type of mediation process that is somewhat similar to a court trial, where an impartial mediator asks the parties questions to determine the facts of the dispute and their interests. The mediator then uses this information to help the parties resolve their dispute. This process is very structured and is often used in legal mediation. Holistic mediation.

Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven\\u2019t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
