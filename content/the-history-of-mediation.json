In mediation, the mediator does not impose a solution on the parties. Instead, he or she helps the two sides find a solution on their own, based on their interests and needs.

Religion, psychology, and even psychedelic drugs have been used as tools for mediation throughout history.\nMediation as we know it today got its start in Europe in the late 19th century. It started out as a tool for resolving labor disputes, but soon became popular in other areas of dispute resolution as well. A Swiss man named Ferdinand G. Ph. Benoit is often credited as the inventor of modern mediation. He developed a method of mediation called the \\u201Cbenoit method\\u201D and published it in a Swiss newspaper article in 1887.

When it comes to resolving conflict in business relationships, mediation is one of the most effective strategies. The type of mediation process you use will depend on the needs and interests of the parties. Here are some common types of mediation processes you may come across:  Traditional mediation. This is the classic mediation process, where the parties sit down with a mediator, who asks them questions, facilitates communication, and guides them in finding a solution. This is a flexible process, but it does depend on the parties being able to communicate directly with each other. Mediational inquiry. This is a type of mediation process that is somewhat similar to a court trial, where an impartial mediator asks the parties questions to determine the facts of the dispute and their interests. The mediator then uses this information to help the parties resolve their dispute. This process is very structured and is often used in legal mediation. Holistic mediation. This is a process that seeks to look at the entire dispute from various angles and on various levels \\u2014 both the facts of the situation and the interests of the parties. This type of mediation process can explore the broader implications of the dispute for the parties and their relationships.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Limitations of Mediation\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Although mediation is a highly effective dispute resolution process, it does have its limitations. If the parties in a dispute have conflicting interests that they cannot mutually agree on, mediation is not the right process to use.\nMediation works best when the parties are able to express their interests and find solutions that work for them \\u2014 rather than imposing solutions that one party imposes on the other. In some situations, one party has such a distinct advantage over the other that it is impossible for the disadvantaged party to find a solution that works for them.\nMediation also does not work for situations where one party is able to impose a solution on the other.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Mediation is a process of third-party intervention that enables the conflicting parties to resolve their disputes peacefully.
