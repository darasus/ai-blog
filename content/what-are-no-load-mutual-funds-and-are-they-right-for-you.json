  "summary": "A no-load fund is a mutual fund that doesnâ€™t charge a sales fee, known as a \"load\" Front-end loads are usually charged when you purchase the fund, while deferred loads are deducted when you sell the fund. No-load funds are easy for you to purchase and manage, easy to do and easy to buy and manage. The downsides include tax-efficiency, low-maintenance, professional management and lack of diversification in your portfolio. The downside: You must be willing to research and manage your own investments for signs of risk.",

They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public.
