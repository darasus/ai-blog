However, investing in the stock market is not as simple as buying stocks and forgetting about them for 10 or 20 years. It requires constant monitoring, research, and analysis to identify the right opportunities and manage risk. The Great Recession of 2007-08 is a perfect example of how risky investing can be. Many people who were new to investing suffered significant losses when their investments tanked during that time. If you\\u2019re thinking about investing your money in stocks, here are 10 things you need to know before doing so.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times\\u2014not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. As a result, your average cost per share is lower than if you had invested the entire amount at once.\nAs an example, let\\u2019s assume an investor has $10,000 to invest in stocks and has been debating between two companies: ABC stock and XYZ stock. If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then. Hence the investor decides to dollar cost average by investing $5,000 today and another $5,000 10 days from now in order to invest the final $5,000 30 days from now \\u2013 spending an equal dollar amount each time ($2,500 per investment). This way they can reduce their risk as well as smooth out the peaks and troughs of their returns.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
