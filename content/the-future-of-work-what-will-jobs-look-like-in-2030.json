Many business travelers are afraid to fly. Even those who aren\\u2019t afraid to fly are thinking twice about whether it\\u2019s worth the risk of contracting flu on a plane. As a result, airlines have seen ticket sales plummet and some are struggling to remain profitable.\nAirlines across the world have responded by reducing their service and capacity, which has led to a decrease in air travel demand and left many airlines with unprofitable operations. Some airlines have even ceased operations completely until demand returns or they see an opportunity for sustainable growth once the pandemic ends.\nThe global pandemic has impacted all airlines, not just those directly affected regions.
