In the future, the way you work will be more personalized, with more focus on total wellbeing and less on sitting in an office from 9 to 5. People will work more flexibly, with more control over how and when they work. And we\\u2019ll see more diversity: with more people working remotely and more people of different ages and backgrounds collaborating together.

There will be new ways to find work and new ways to work together that we can\\u2019t even imagine today. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and Blockchain will redefine how we work.

Recent data shows that the number of freelancers worldwide is expected to rise to more than 58% of the total workforce by the year 2030. Plus, almost one in three workers are already employed in a freelance capacity. Whether it\\u2019s because they prefer flexibility or they\\u2019re unable to find a traditional job, this shift is already underway \\u2014 and it\\u2019s gaining momentum. The concept of 9-to-5 work is already outdated. And every industry will need to adapt to this new way of working. Companies that fail to adapt to these new ways of working will not survive.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Job automation and robotics\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The future of work is likely to see the rise of automation and robotics, as machines are designed to perform more human tasks and take over the jobs that are either dangerous or that people don\\u2019t want to do. But this isn\\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, automation could potentially have a positive effect on the workplace. Automated job procedures can be quicker, more consistent, and more accurate than human workers. And people can then focus on higher-value tasks that require critical thinking or creativity. There\\u2019s no doubt that automation will take over some of the roles we currently think of as \\u201Cjobs.\\u201D But the rise of automation will also create new jobs and opportunities. For example, engineers and manufacturers will need to create new kinds of robots and systems to automate their processes. And there will be more opportunities to focus on designing and managing automation systems. In some cases, automation may actually create more jobs than it takes away. For example, a data centre that replaces its human workers with robots would need to hire people to maintain the robots and repair them when they break down.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The rise of the freelance economy\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"With an increased focus on freelance work, there will be an even greater demand for \\u201Clocation-independent\\u201D jobs.

This benefits both the employer and the employee: it allows people to focus on their work, and it gives them flexibility to manage their time and find a work-life balance. The rise of the freelance economy will also impact industries that traditionally have hired full-time employees, such as the healthcare sector. As technology enables more remote work, people could see a shift away from 9-to-5 jobs and towards 24/7 work. This could create challenges for industries that are used to having a consistent work schedule, but it could also open up new opportunities for people who prefer to work remotely.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"More remote workers\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The way people work is likely to change even more as we move towards an even more \\u201Cdistributed\\u201D workforce.

There\\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest that longer workdays aren\\u2019t productive \\u2014 and in some cases, they can even be counterproductive. Working from home or from a different location entirely can help employees avoid the pressure of a traditional 9-to-5 schedule and make better use of their time. Remote work also allows employees to focus on the tasks that are most important, rather than spending time commuting to work or doing work that isn\\u2019t relevant to their job.

And while these changes may bring some challenges, they\\u2019ll also present more opportunities than ever before to find meaning in the work we do.
