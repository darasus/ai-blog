Yes, it is, but what it really is, is a programming language with a different approach to language design. This means that Go has a different way of solving problems that are encountered in other programming languages. Go was released back in 2009 by Google. It was made with the intention of being a software engineering language, which means that it is mainly used for creating software systems. If you have heard of C, then you will have a good idea of what this language is all about.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The idea behind designing Go was to build a language that would be fast, easy to use, and have a clean syntax. The fact that it was created by Google also proves that it is a language that is of a quality that is unrivalled by many other programming languages.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why use Go for embedded programming?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When selecting a programming language for embedded programming, a number of factors have to be taken into account. Yes, you need to select a language that suits your project needs and also the device with which the software will be running on. In many cases, you might just be using the same programming language that was used to create the device\\u2019s firmware. However, in many other cases, you might want to use a different language because of the advantages that it offers. With that said, let\\u2019s take a look at some of the advantages of using Go for embedded programming:\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Robust ecosystem - There is no denying that the language\\u2019s robust ecosystem is one of the reasons why many developers are choosing to use Go for embedded programming.

If you need to scale your project to more devices or add more functionality to an existing device, using Go will be the best choice.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Great documentation - Another factor that makes Go a good choice when selecting a language for embedded programming is the fact that it comes with great documentation.
