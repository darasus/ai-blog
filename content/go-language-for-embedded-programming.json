  "summary": "Go is a programming language with a different approach to language design. This means that Go has a different way of solving problems that are encountered in other programming languages. The languageâ€™s robust ecosystem is one of the reasons why many developers are choosing to use Go for embedded programming. It is easy to read and write code in this language, which means that it is suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike, giving them the advantage of completing projects much faster.

There are so many programming languages available in the market that it might seem confusing for programmers to select the one that best suits their needs and also caters to future needs.\nProgramming is not as simple as it seems, especially when you consider all the different aspects involved with it. It is not just about learning code, but also understanding which types of projects you want to take up and what kind of structure your career will take from here on. So when choosing a programming language, there are certain aspects you need to keep in mind before making your final decision.

Yes, it is, but what it really is, is a programming language with a different approach to language design. This means that Go has a different way of solving problems that are encountered in other programming languages. Go was released back in 2009 by Google. It was made with the intention of being a software engineering language, which means that it is mainly used for creating software systems. If you have heard of C, then you will have a good idea of what this language is all about.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The idea behind designing Go was to build a language that would be fast, easy to use, and have a clean syntax. The fact that it was created by Google also proves that it is a language that is of a quality that is unrivalled by many other programming languages.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why use Go for embedded programming?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When selecting a programming language for embedded programming, a number of factors have to be taken into account. Yes, you need to select a language that suits your project needs and also the device with which the software will be running on. In many cases, you might just be using the same programming language that was used to create the device\\u2019s firmware. However, in many other cases, you might want to use a different language because of the advantages that it offers. With that said, let\\u2019s take a look at some of the advantages of using Go for embedded programming:\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Robust ecosystem - There is no denying that the language\\u2019s robust ecosystem is one of the reasons why many developers are choosing to use Go for embedded programming. This ecosystem offers features such as a cross-compilation tool, an automatic memory management system, a large standard library, and much more.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Easy to scale - Another advantage associated with using Go for embedded programming is the fact that it is easy to scale. If you need to scale your project to more devices or add more functionality to an existing device, using Go will be the best choice.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Great documentation - Another factor that makes Go a good choice when selecting a language for embedded programming is the fact that it comes with great documentation. This documentation is easy to understand even if you are new to programming, which means that it is suitable for people of all skill levels.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Open source - Finally, another reason why you should use Go for embedded programming is the fact that it is an open source language. This means that you can benefit from its community as well as make changes or report bugs if required.\")),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Pros of Go for Embedded Programming\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Here, we take a look at some of the main pros of using Go for embedded programming:\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Easy to read and write - The syntax of Go is extremely simple, which means that it is easy to read and write code in this language.

This means that you will have to wait a bit longer for the code to be compiled and ready for execution.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Non-deterministic resource consumption - The non-deterministic resource consumption that we refer to here is the fact that Go is a garbage collected language.
