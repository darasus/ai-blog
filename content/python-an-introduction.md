summary: Python is a coding language that has been growing in popularity for
  several years. It is an open source programming language, which means that it
  is free to use and distribute. There are a number of different ways to learn
  the language, including self-guided tutorials, in-person classes, and even
  online courses. You will only truly master Python if you put in the time and
  effort to do so, so try and practice it daily. You can choose from a range of
  Python projects, but we recommend selecting projects that involve creating a
  simple program or application.
intro: >-
  Are you looking to break into the world of coding, or perhaps you’re
  simply curious about the different types of programming languages out there.
  Whatever your reason for investigating coding, Python is an excellent place to
  start learning about computer programming and creating your own programs.

  Coding is often a seemingly inaccessible skill, reserved for those with a knack for mathematics or sciences. However, learning to code isn’t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding. The key is finding the right resources and a step-by-step learning process that doesn’t feel like a burdensome chore. 

  If you’re ready to begin exploring the wonderful world of Python coding, read on to learn more.

## What is Python?

Python is a coding language that has been growing in popularity for several years. Originally created in 1991, Python is a relatively “new” programming language and is constantly evolving with new features and capabilities.
While there are several different programming languages in use today, Python is unique in that it is one of the most widely used languages. This means that developers create and use a lot of different software applications based on the Python code. These applications are used for a wide range of different tasks including website creation and design, data analysis, scientific research, and even creating video games.

Python is an open source programming language, which means that it is free to use and distribute. It is also an easy-to-read programming language, making it an excellent starting point for anyone interested in coding.

## Why Learn Python?

If you are just starting out on your coding journey, you might be asking yourself why you should even bother learning Python. After all, you might be wondering if the language you choose to begin with really matters.
Although the language you decide to start with may not be the one you end up using for the rest of your career, there are a few good reasons for starting with Python. First of all, Python is a general-purpose language. This means that it can be used in a wide variety of different situations and for a range of applications. It is also an easy-to-read language, making it an excellent starting point for those looking to break into the world of coding.

## How to Learn Python: Step by step guide

Before you begin diving into the world of Python coding, there are a few things you’ll want to get in order first.
First, make sure you have a firm grasp of the basics of coding. This includes understanding the fundamental concepts and terminology related to computer programming. Because you will be creating your own programs, it is also important to learn how to break down problems into smaller pieces that can be solved through code.
Next, select a good place to start learning Python. There are a number of different ways to learn the language, including self-guided tutorials, in-person classes, and even online courses.
Finally, make sure to practice! As with any skill, you will only truly master Python if you put in the time and effort to do so.

## Decide on your goal

One of the first things you should do when learning Python is to decide on your long-term goal.
Why do you want to learn Python? What is your ultimate goal? Are you simply interested in learning a new skill, or do you plan on making coding a central part of your career? If you do want to pursue coding as a career, make sure to select a programming language that is in demand.

## Install and learn the fundamentals of coding

As with any new skill, you will want to start by learning the fundamentals of coding. Find a good online Python tutorial and follow the instructions step-by-step.
You can also follow along with a Python lesson on Youtube or create your own notes as you go through the tutorial.
As you work through the fundamentals of Python coding, make sure to work on a few different mini-projects. You can choose from a wide range of Python projects, but we recommend selecting projects that involve creating a simple program or application.

## Build a habit of constantly learning and practicing

Once you have learned the basics of coding and completed a few mini-projects, you will want to maintain your momentum. Make learning Python a part of your everyday life. There are a few different ways to do this, including:

- Join a coding club or group: You can find a coding club or group at your local university or even in your own neighbourhood. This is a great way to stay motivated and meet like-minded individuals.
- Stay up-to-date on the latest news in the world of coding: This can be done through a variety of different news sources.
- Practice Python daily: Set aside a specific time each day to work on Python projects.
- Take on a real-world project: Get your hands dirty and try to solve a real-world problem using Python.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, learning to code is a journey, and you should make sure to enjoy the process. Don’t get frustrated if you find the process challenging. This is normal, even for experienced coders.

Instead, stay positive, and remember that even the most skilled and experienced programmers didn’t become experts overnight. Stay focused on your goal, and develop a passion for coding.
