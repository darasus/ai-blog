## Scrambled Eggs

Scrambled eggs are very easy to make, but they can be difficult to master. When you scramble your eggs, you want to make sure not to overcook them. Scrambled eggs are best when they are moist, almost like a creamy consistency. You don't want them to turn out dry and crumbly. Also, you want to make sure not to over-break your eggs. You want to whisk them together really well so that you don't have any large chunks of egg left, but you also don't want to break them too much so that the consistency doesn't stay nice and creamy.

Scrambled eggs are best served on their own or with some buttered toast on the side. While they are delicious with basically anything, they don't go too well with anything else.

## Poached Eggs

Poached eggs are similar to scrambled eggs in that they have a creamy consistency and are very easy to make. The only difference is that you don't whisk them together like you do with scrambled eggs. Instead, you pour the egg into water that is boiling (or simmering) and let it sit there until the eggs are fully cooked. The water should be just barely at a simmer; if it is boiling too rapidly, it will cook the eggs too quickly, and they will come out too dry. You can also add vinegar to the water to get that nice, soft texture that goes well with eggs.

Poached eggs are great served with some toast or a bagel and some jam or jelly. They also go really well with bacon and home fries or a baked potato.

## Sunny Side Up Eggs

Sunny side up eggs are where you don't flip the egg over to cook the other side. The yolk is fully cooked, but the white part isn't. Sunny side up eggs are great for people who like the yolk to be runny but don't want to deal with the hassle of poaching an egg or trying to make a scrambled egg come out right.

Sunny side up eggs are great just as they are or with a little salt and pepper. They are also great with a slice of bacon on the side.

## Decoding an egg's recipe

The recipe for a standard egg consists of three parts: the white, the yolk and the extra ingredients such as salt and pepper. The white is the thin liquid that surrounds the yolk. This liquid is usually clear and colourless, but if the chicken is unhealthy (or old), this liquid may be yellow or green. Also, it may be thicker or thinner than normal. The yolk is the centre of the egg. Most of the nutrients in the egg are found in the yolk. The extra ingredients can be anything from salt and pepper to herbs, spices or even a little bit of butter. The recipe for making different types of eggs varies according to the ingredients. 

## To Toss, or Not to Toss? The age-old question.

People have debated over the years whether it's best to toss or not to toss your scrambled eggs. There are some who say you should and others who say you shouldn't. So which one is it? Well, it really all depends on how you like your eggs. If you like them a little bit runny but not too much, it's best to toss them constantly to make sure they don't dry out and turn crumbly. If you like them fully cooked and a bit more moist, it's best not to stir them too much so that they don't break down too much.

## Bottom line

Eggs are probably one of the most versatile foods in the world. They can be eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner. One of the great things about eggs is that you can make so many different things with them. You can scramble them, boil them, poach them, fry them and more. No matter how you like your eggs, there are many ways to cook them so they taste great!
