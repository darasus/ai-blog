There are many ways to cook eggs, but three of the most popular ways are scrambled, poached, and sunny side up. Each method has its own unique flavor and texture, so itâ€™s important to choose the right one for your dish.

Scrambled eggs are cooked by whisking the eggs and then cooking them in a pan over low heat. This method results in fluffy, creamy eggs that are perfect for breakfast dishes.

Poached eggs are cooked by gently simmering them in water. This method results in a soft, delicate egg that is often used in salads or as a garnish.

Sunny side up eggs are cooked by frying them in a pan over medium heat. This method results in a crispy egg that is perfect for sandwiches or as a topping on a dish.
