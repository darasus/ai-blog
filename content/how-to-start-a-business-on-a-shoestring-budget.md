## Define your business goals

You can’t expect to accomplish something if you don’t know what you’re aiming for. Before you even begin to create a budget, you need to know what your goals are for your business. Do you want to hire employees? Where will you find the funding? What are your long-term goals in terms of growth? How will your business plan accommodate this growth? By clearly defining the goals of your small business, the budget process will be a whole lot easier.

Some goals you may want to consider setting for your company include: What is your desired revenue? How will you attract new customers? How will you retain your customers? What is your long-term vision for the business? How will you fund your business? What are your short-term goals?


## Break down your cash-flow forecasts

Cash-flow forecasts help you to understand and plan for future expenses. Depending on what you’re selling and the industry of your business, you may incur costs far in advance of revenue coming in. For example, if you manufacture goods, you’ll likely incur costs in the beginning stages of production. Then you’ll need to wait until they’re sold before getting the revenue. If you don’t factor in these expenses, you may find yourself in a financial bind. To avoid this problem, break down your cash-flow forecasts for the next year. By breaking down your cash-flow forecasts, you’ll have a better idea of when to expect revenue and when to expect expenses.

While every business is different and will incur different costs, you can use a simple template to break down your cash-flow forecasts. Include a table that lists the months of the year along with their expenses and expected revenue, if applicable. You can include all of your expected expenses and their related costs if you’d like, but it may be unnecessary. Break down your cash-flow forecasts on a monthly basis, if possible, to get the most accurate results. If your business is seasonal, break down your forecasts accordingly.


## Know what you’re working with

Before you can start forecasting how much you’ll be spending, you need to know exactly where your money is going. You can’t create accurate budgets without knowing how much you have to work with. You need to know: How much you make each month. What your monthly expenses are. How much money you have saved. When is your next pay day. You can use this information to build budgets that work for your company and your monthly income. Additionally, you can track your spending to better understand where your money goes on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This way, you can better predict your future spending and avoid unnecessary expenses.

If you’re just starting out, you may not make a lot of money each month. This doesn’t mean you can’t start a business. Instead of trying to create a budget that doesn’t fit your current finances, start small. Create a budget that is manageable for your company’s current finances. As your company grows, you can build new budgets that account for the change in your financial situation.


## Be smart with your marketing dollars

It’s important to remember that you can’t do everything when it comes to your business’s marketing. You may want to create a broad campaign that takes advantage of every marketing channel available, but this approach is often unrealistic for small businesses. Instead, you need to be smart with your marketing dollars. Create a budget that takes into account the cost of your marketing channels and the return on investment (ROI) they’ll provide.

For example, you may decide to invest $2,000 on Google AdWords ads. You might also decide to invest $500 on Facebook ads. You may also decide to invest $500 in a booth at a local trade show. While these are all effective marketing channels, they also cost money. You need to take these costs into account when creating your budget. You also need to take the ROI of each marketing channel into account. This will help you decide which marketing channels are the best investment for your business and which ones have the highest return on investment.


## A small business doesn’t have to mean a small budget

You may feel like a small business means a small budget. But that’s not necessarily the case. You can create a budget that works for your company no matter what its size. You just need to be smart with your spending. This means understanding your company’s income and expenses. It also means accounting for any fixed costs you have in running your business. If you have employees or rent, this needs to be taken into account when creating your budget.

You can also create multiple budgets based on your company’s departments. For example, you may want to create separate budgets for marketing, operations, and employees’ salaries. You can then determine how much money each department receives each month. While this may not be a good idea for growing companies, it can be a great way to manage finances for established companies.


## Conclusion

Whether you’re planning to launch a small side business or branch into new territory as an established company, you’ll need a financial plan to get started. A budget enables you to set a monetary limit on the scope of your business venture. It also helps you stay within that limit, avoiding unnecessary expenses that may lead to bankruptcy. Your budget can be as simple or detailed as you’d like, but the basic framework is always the same.

When creating a budget, it’s important to remember that each business is different. You can’t create a one-size-fits-all budget and expect it to work for your company. Instead, you need to understand your company’s finances and create a budget that works with those numbers.
