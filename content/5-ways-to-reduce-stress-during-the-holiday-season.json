It’s important to set clear expectations and agree on ground rules with the mediator and the disputants. Confidentiality is key to a productive mediation, and the parties should have an agreement that both sides are willing to sign.

It\\u2019s no wonder, then, that businesses are taking note and incorporating mediation into their organizational culture as a preemptive measure against possible legal action.\nMediation is a collaborative negotiation process with a neutral third party known as a mediator who helps individuals or parties in conflict reach an agreement that's fair to all involved. Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.
