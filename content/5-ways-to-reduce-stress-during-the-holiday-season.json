There\\u2019s shopping, traveling and entertaining to consider. And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response. So if you want to reduce the stress of this festive time of year, here are five ways you can do so:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Once that timer goes off, you are done baking. You don\\u2019t have to be a baking master to do this. It can apply to everything, including gift buying, decorating, entertaining, or whatever else you need to do.\nWe may have a lot to do during the holidays, but we have a set amount of time that we have to do it.

From your family to your friends, to the people you work with, everyone wants to help and has a lot to offer.\nIf you are feeling stressed because you are trying to take on too much, ask for help. Tell the people in your life that you need their help. You don\\u2019t have to do everything yourself, and there is no shame in letting people help you.

Break-ups are never easy, and they can be even more difficult and hurtful if it\\u2019s with your first love or someone you really cared about. These tips will help get you through any heartbreak and back into a place of peace.\nWhen you experience a break-up, whether it\\u2019s from a partner, friend or family member, it leaves you with an empty feeling. It hurts so much because you placed so many emotions into the relationship that it now feels like a part of who you are has been taken from you. Even though the person who broke up with you may have been oblivious to the pain they were causing by ending things, that doesn\\u2019t make breaking up any easier for anyone involved.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
