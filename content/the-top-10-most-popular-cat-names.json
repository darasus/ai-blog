And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response.

After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
