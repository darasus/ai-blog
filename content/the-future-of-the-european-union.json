You\\u2019d be right\\u2014but you\\u2019d also be missing the most important people. Because while those other people are all important, the real rulers of this world are much more human: They\\u2019re celebrities.\nThe way we see the world has changed dramatically over the past few decades. In part because of social media, but mostly because of the rise of celebrities as a fixture in our lives, almost every aspect of life has been reframed by who is watching. It used to be that if you wanted to become famous, you had to have something worth saying or do something exciting enough to get on TV.\nNow all you need is a million followers on Instagram and a sex tape with another famous person. It\\u2019s more than just a silly trend\\u2014it reveals something fundamental about how we now see the world.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
