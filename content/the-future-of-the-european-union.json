This union of communist states collapsed in 1991 and left many people wondering how such a powerful alliance could fall apart so quickly. The answer lies in the complex nature of the Soviet Union as a union of independent states that also operated as part of a centralized government. When combined with pressures from outside forces, this unique structure led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe rise and fall of the Soviet Union can be traced back to Vladimir Lenin and his Marxist ideology. In 1917, Lenin led the Bolshevik Revolution and gained control over Russia. At this time, he also introduced policies that would help establish communism throughout Russia and other areas \\u2013 known as \\u201Cthe fourth partition\\u201D \\u2013 controlled by his Red Army.
