There are a lot of great games out there for couples to enjoy together. Here are some of our favorites from this year:

1. Stardew Valley: This charming farming simulator is the perfect game for couples who want to relax and enjoy a slower-paced experience together. There’s something incredibly satisfying about working together to build up your farm and watching it grow over time.

2. Overcooked: If you and your partner are looking for a more fast-paced and chaotic experience, then Overcooked is the perfect game for you. This cooking simulator will have you both working together (and sometimes against each other) to try and get the orders out on time. It’s a lot of fun, and it’s sure to get your heart racing.

3. A Way Out: This unique co-op game can only be played by two people, making it the perfect choice for couples. A Way Out tells the story of two prisoners who must work together to escape from jail. It’s an emotional and thrilling ride that you and your partner are sure to enjoy.

4. Rocket League: This high-octane soccer game is a blast to play with a friend. You’ll have a blast working together to score goals and dominate the competition.

5. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: One of the best games of the year, period. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an incredible open-world adventure that you and your partner can explore together. You’ll never get tired of discovering all the secrets this massive game has to offer.
