## Cards Against Humanity

If you’re looking for something quick and silly, nothing beats Cards Against Humanity. This card game is perfect for two people who are looking to have a laugh. Each round, you deal out 10 black cards and invite your partner to write down a phrase using one of the cards for each round. The other player has to guess what the phrase is. Whoever guesses the most phrases correctly wins the round. The rules are simple enough, but the game’s crassness is what makes it so hilarious. You’ll find yourself laughing out loud at some of the phrases, and it will be just what you need to relieve stress and relax. It’s the perfect game for a couple’s night in, so don’t miss out on this hilariously raunchy game.

## Codenames

If you’re looking for a more strategic game, Codenames is the perfect option. In this game, players are given a “spy” card with a word or two on it. These words are the code that the spies use to communicate to one another. The opposing team, however, is given a card that has a grid with a word in every spot. Their job is to try and figure out which word matches the code word on your team’s card by asking you questions that can only be answered with a “yes” or “no.”
There are two ways to win the game: either your team guesses all of the code words or your opponent’s team guesses all of your cards. If you win, you can use your code words to communicate with your team in the real world. It’s a clever game that requires a fair amount of strategy, but it’s also simple enough for players of all skill levels to enjoy. And since you can play with as many people as you’d like, it makes for a great couples’ board game.

## Orchard

If you’re looking for a game that is super cute, Orchard is the perfect option. This adorable game challenges players to work together to grow a garden by rolling the dice and selecting matching cards. Whoever collects all of the cards first wins the game. Though the game is super lighthearted, it can get pretty intense when you’re down to the wire with your partner. With adorable artwork and simple rules, Orchard is a great game for couples who want something light to play before bed. It’s also great for kids, so it can be enjoyed by the whole family.

## Sent Together

If you and your partner like to solve puzzles and challenge yourselves, Sent Together is the perfect board game for you. In this game, you and your partner are given a set of words that you have to figure out, and you can only use one word in each sentence. You both write down your sentence on a notecard, and once you’re done, you swap cards with your partner and see if they can correctly solve your puzzle.
The game isn’t too difficult; however, it gets a bit tricky if your partner is left-handed like many people are. While this game may not be the most exciting to play, it’s sure to bring you and your partner closer as partners who enjoy working together to solve puzzles. And since you’re only competing with yourself, you can’t lose—all you can do is win.

## board game

If you’re looking for a board game that will challenge you and your partner, you can’t go wrong with this one. Once Upon A Time: Descendants is a game based on the Disney Descendants movie series.

This game is a bit more advanced than others on this list, but it’s also excellent for both kids and adults. It has tons of expansions, including an upcoming Once Upon a Time: Wonder Woman edition. It’s the perfect game if you’re looking for something challenging that can be enjoyed by the whole family.

## Ticket to Ride: Europe

If you’re looking for a game that’s a bit more intense, Ticket to Ride: Europe is an excellent option. In this game, players collect train cards with different colors and numbers on them. They use these cards to make a railway between two cities on the map, but you have to collect all of the cards for the route.
The other players try to collect the cards before you do, so you have to strategize and make sure you’re collecting enough cards to make the route. This game can get pretty intense, so it’s best if you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to how competitive you are. This game is great for couples who want something a bit more intense than other games.

## Sum

If you’re looking for a more intense game that challenges you and your partner, you should check out Sum. In this game, you and your partner are given a set of numbers and formulas that you have to solve. Whoever solves the equation first wins the round. Each round is timed, so you have to calculate as quickly as possible.
This game is more advanced than most other games on this list, so it’s perfect for couples who are good with numbers. It can get pretty intense, so it’s best if you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to how competitive you are. This game is great if you and your partner like a challenge and want to test your skills against each other.
