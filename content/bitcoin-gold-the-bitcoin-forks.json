In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!

A fork can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common reason is to create a new cryptocurrency that has a different mining algorithm or mining process from the original Bitcoin. Bitcoin forks are also called \\u201Chard forks\\u201D, and they are different from \\u201Csoftware forks\\u201D in that a Bitcoin fork creates a completely new currency, while a software fork remains as a new branch of the original currency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Hard forks are often a result of a disagreement in the community about how to best scale the cryptocurrency to meet demand and accommodate more users. Bitcoin has been growing in popularity over the past few years, but it has a scalability issue. The Bitcoin blockchain can process a limited number of transactions per second. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Bitcoin Gold: What is It?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019ve been following the cryptocurrency space at all, you\\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Gold, or BTG, is a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain. The goal of this fork was to create a more decentralized network by introducing what the creators call a \\u201Cproof of work change\\u201D.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The idea behind this change is to make Bitcoin mining more decentralized again by making the hardware requirements for mining less demanding. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, you need specialized hardware to effectively mine coins and participate in the network.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But with the introduction of Bitcoin Gold, you can use regular computers to mine the new cryptocurrency. The goal here was to create a more distributed network, where anyone can participate and contribute to the mining process.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Get Bitcoin Gold?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you want to get some Bitcoin Gold, you\\u2019ll first need to get some Bitcoin. The best way to do this is to sign up for a free account with Coinbase. Coinbase is the most common and easiest way to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Once you have some Bitcoin in your account, you simply need to transfer it over to a cryptocurrency exchange where you can trade it for Bitcoin Gold.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some good options for exchanges where you can trade your Bitcoin for Bitcoin Gold include Binance and Bittrex.

But this also poses an interesting question: How does one measure decentralization?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One way to measure decentralization is by looking at the distribution of the total supply of a given cryptocurrency. The more decentralized a cryptocurrency is, the less concentrated its supply will be. In other words, the fewer hands a given cryptocurrency is in, the more decentralized it is.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"What is Bitcoin Cash?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin Cash is another popular Bitcoin fork. It\\u2019s also one of the first forks of the original Bitcoin blockchain, having happened in August 2017. The goal of this fork was to increase the scalability of the network by increasing the block size to 8 MB.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For those who don\\u2019t know, the block size is the amount of data that each block on the blockchain can store.

In the case of Bitcoin Cash, the goal is to create a more scalable network that can process more transactions per second. This is important because one of the scalability issues that Bitcoin faces is that each block can only store a certain amount of data. The more data that each block can store, the more transactions the network can process each second.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin Cash\\u2019s solution to this is to increase the block size. This can be a risky proposition, however. The larger the block size, the more data each block can store. This can pose a security risk because it means that each block can store more data, giving hackers more space to try to hack the blockchain.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Final Words\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As you can see, there are many different types of forks beyond just software! In this article, we explored Bitcoin forks: Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash. We also talked about what a fork is, why they happen, and how to get and store these new digital currencies.
