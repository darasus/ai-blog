Blockchain is a decentralized network that creates a ledger of all transactions that are verified by members of the network. These networks are most commonly seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they have many other uses as well.\nBlockchain technology has the potential to streamline almost any industry, from finance to retail to even healthcare.

Each one has its own unique features and potential uses. There are thousands of different investors who have bought into the world of cryptocurrency, and each individual has their own reasons for investing in one coin or another. Some people invest in specific cryptocurrencies because they see a particular use case for that token; others invest in specific coins as a hedge against another token; and some invest based on the technical details and potential future use case for that token. There are many individuals who invest in specific tokens primarily because of their privacy features. Privacy is becoming a very important factor to consider when choosing which cryptocurrency to buy into, especially now that so many nefarious forces are targeting the cryptocurrency community with phishing attacks and hacks.
