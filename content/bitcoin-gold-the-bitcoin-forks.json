For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.

A fork can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common reason is to create a new cryptocurrency that has a different mining algorithm or mining process from the original Bitcoin. Bitcoin forks are also called \\u201Chard forks\\u201D, and they are different from \\u201Csoftware forks\\u201D in that a Bitcoin fork creates a completely new currency, while a software fork remains as a new branch of the original currency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Hard forks are often a result of a disagreement in the community about how to best scale the cryptocurrency to meet demand and accommodate more users.

The goal of this fork was to create a more decentralized network by introducing what the creators call a \\u201Cproof of work change\\u201D.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The idea behind this change is to make Bitcoin mining more decentralized again by making the hardware requirements for mining less demanding. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, you need specialized hardware to effectively mine coins and participate in the network.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But with the introduction of Bitcoin Gold, you can use regular computers to mine the new cryptocurrency.

The best way to do this is to sign up for a free account with Coinbase. Coinbase is the most common and easiest way to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Once you have some Bitcoin in your account, you simply need to transfer it over to a cryptocurrency exchange where you can trade it for Bitcoin Gold.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some good options for exchanges where you can trade your Bitcoin for Bitcoin Gold include Binance and Bittrex.

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary.

But few digital solutions are as effective and game-changing as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them. This process eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Blockchain technology also has other benefits, including faster transactions and greater transparency.  Moreover, it has the potential to reshape industries from finance to logistics, healthcare and beyond.
