For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.

Bitcoin forks are also called \\u201Chard forks\\u201D, and they are different from \\u201Csoftware forks\\u201D in that a Bitcoin fork creates a completely new currency, while a software fork remains as a new branch of the original currency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Hard forks are often a result of a disagreement in the community about how to best scale the cryptocurrency to meet demand and accommodate more users.
