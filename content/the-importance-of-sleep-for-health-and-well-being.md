## What is Sleep and Why is it so Important?

When we talk about sleep, we are actually referring to two different things. The first is sleep itself, which is a naturally-occurring state of restful consciousness. The other is the need for sleep, which is regulated by circadian rhythm.

Sleep is a biological process regulated by the body. During the natural sleep process, your blood pressure, the body’s temperature and oxygen levels drop. At the same time, your body releases certain hormones, including serotonin, which helps regulate your mood.
In order for your body to function properly and properly regulate itself, it needs a certain amount of sleep each day. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night.

## The Importance of Sleep for Health

When you get enough sleep each night, your body has a chance to rest and do its repair work. This allows you to be healthier overall. When you don’t sleep enough, your body doesn’t have this opportunity.
Out of everything you do, getting enough sleep will have the most impact on your health. Sleep is so important for your general health because it regulates your hormones, digestion, metabolism and immune system.
Sleep can also prevent the onset of certain diseases. Among others, studies have found that sleep can prevent diabetes, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
The amount of sleep you need varies from person to person, but most experts recommend getting between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. Getting more than 9 hours is not necessarily better, though. It’s possible to get too much sleep, and this can also be harmful in certain ways.

## The Importance of Sleep for Well-being

While sleep is important for your health, it’s also good for your well-being. Sleep can greatly help with your productivity and mood.
If you’re short on sleep, your whole day will be impacted. You will be less productive and have a negative outlook. Your energy levels will be lower, and you will be more prone to making mistakes.
If you aren’t getting enough sleep, you will also have a harder time dealing with stress. Sleep is one of the best ways to relieve stress and recharge your batteries. Sleep has even been said to be as effective as yoga or meditation.
