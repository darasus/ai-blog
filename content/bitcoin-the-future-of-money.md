## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital currency that was first outlined in a white paper published in 2008 and began being traded as an investment option in September 2017. It’s the first example of a cryptocurrency, an asset that can be easily transferred between users (or "adapters") and also has a fixed supply. This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.

The creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.

## How do you buy Bitcoin?

There are a number of ways you can buy Bitcoin. You can purchase them on an exchange using your desired currency or you can use a broker like Coinbase to purchase them using a credit card.

Once you’ve purchased Bitcoin, you can store them on an exchange or in a wallet. There are also hardware wallets that can be used as a secure method of storing cryptocurrencies offline.

There are also a number of different ways you can sell Bitcoin. You can sell them back to exchanges that allow you to exchange your Bitcoin for your desired currency or you can sell them to a broker like Coinbase.

Finally, it’s important to note that Bitcoin and altcoin prices can be extremely volatile. This means that the price of your holdings can fluctuate significantly from day to day, so it’s important to make sure you’re willing to take on this level of risk before investing.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a blockchain platform developed in 2014 by the company behind Bitcoin, with the goal of reducing some of the restrictions associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain. The Ethereum network supports a variety of decentralized applications, including decentralized autonomous organizations and various types of smart contracts.

The Ripple network allows for the transfer of various different types of assets and can also be used for real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. The network charges a very low fee for transactions, which is one of the reasons that it has been adopted by a number of financial institutions.

The Litecoin network has a number of different features that are different from those on the Bitcoin network. For example, it has a higher cap on the total number of coins that can be mined. The Litecoin network also features a different algorithm for mining and a different blockchain technology.

## Summary

Finally, it’s important to note that Bitcoin and altcoin prices can be extremely volatile. This means that the price of your holdings can fluctuate significantly from day to day, so it’s important to make sure you’re willing to take on this level of risk before investing.

It’s also important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies is a very risky undertaking, even if they do continue to grow in popularity and value. As a result, if you are considering investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, you should make sure you’re prepared for the potential consequences of doing so.
