Protein-packed snacks are an excellent way of keeping your energy levels high and reducing stress eating from boredom or fatigue.",
  "content": "## What is an afternoon slump and why do we get them?\n\nMelatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep. It is naturally produced in our brains when it gets dark outside, signaling for us to start winding down for the day. This hormone is also what causes us to feel tired and sleepy. During the day, melatonin is produced in the pineal gland in our brains. The pineal gland is responsible for regulating sleeping patterns and other hormones, including serotonin.\n\nWe typically have high levels of serotonin throughout the day as it is responsible for regulating mood and appetite. As the sun starts to set, serotonin levels drop and melatonin begins to rise. This is what causes us to feel sleepy and crave foods high in carbohydrates, namely sugary or starchy foods.\n\nWhen it is dark outside and the sun isn’t providing us with the energy we need to stay active, serotonin levels are low, causing many of us to feel sluggish. If you find yourself craving sweets throughout the day or feeling lethargic, serotonin levels may be to blame. The best way to combat an afternoon slump is to eat foods that are high in tryptophan and protein.\n\n## The importance of protein\n\nEating high-protein snacks can help to regulate serotonin levels, keeping your mood up and curbing cravings for starchy or sugary foods. The more protein you consume, the fuller you will feel, reducing the urge to snack on foods that are high in sugar.\n\nNot only does protein help to regulate serotonin, but it also boosts energy levels naturally. Proteins are the building blocks of muscles and many of our body’s internal organs. Eating protein-rich foods has many health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and regulating metabolism.\n\nBoosting your protein intake is crucial if you are looking to lose weight, maintain a healthy weight or build muscle. While carbohydrates provide us with energy, they don’t offer much when it comes to keeping us full. Protein, on the other hand, takes longer to digest, keeping you feeling full for longer and helping to regulate serotonin levels.\n\n## 6 delicious snacks with lots of protein\n\nHard-boiled eggs - One of the tastiest and most convenient ways to get more protein in your diet is to start eating more hard-boiled eggs. Hard-boiled eggs are a great source of protein, with one egg containing 6 grams of protein. This is more than enough to curb your cravings and prevent an afternoon slump.\n\nHummus and veggie wrap - Vegetables and hummus are a delicious combination that are high in protein. One serving of vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers, or lettuce, contains about 2 grams of protein. Combine these with 2 tablespoons of hummus for a delicious snack that is high in protein.\n\nGreek yogurt with berries - A classic snack that is excellent for regulating your mood and keeping you full is a bowl of Greek yogurt with berries. A single serving of Greek yogurt contains 8 grams of protein. Combine that with a few tablespoons of berries, which have 2 grams of protein per serving, and you have a delicious, high-protein snack.\n\nNuts or trail mix - Nuts and trail mix are a great snack to have on hand during the day. They are full of protein and incredibly nutritious. Cashews, peanuts, and almonds all have 6 grams of protein per serving. Mix them with a few handfuls of raisins or dried cranberries for a sweet and satisfying afternoon snack.\n\nConclusion - Snacking throughout the day is not only ideal for regulating your blood sugar, but it can also help keep you from overeating at meal times. By choosing snacks that are high in protein, you can prevent afternoon slumps and keep your mood up throughout the day.\n\nBy choosing snacks that are high in protein, you can prevent afternoon slumps and keep your mood up throughout the day. Snacking throughout the day is ideal for regulating blood sugar and can also help you from overeating at meal times."
