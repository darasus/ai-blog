That\\u2019s because your body needs a variety of nutrients - such as vitamins, minerals, and fats - from different sources in order to function optimally. When one type of food is over- or under-consumed, the consequences can be negative.\nOn the other hand, plant proteins are an important source of essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the human body.
