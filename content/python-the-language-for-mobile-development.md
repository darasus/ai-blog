summary: Python is an open-source programming language developed in the late
  1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics
  and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It’s simple and easy to learn, yet
  capable of handling large and complex projects. Python is one of the most
  widely used programming languages, with thousands of organizations using it
  for various applications. Python code is easy to read and understand, which
  makes it a good choice for newcomers and experienced developers alike. It can
  also be used for web apps, data science and IoT projects.

  With so many programming languages available, it can be challenging for developers to find the best one for a particular project. For example, if the goal is to create an app that will run on multiple different devices and operating systems, what’s the best option?

  If you’re developing mobile apps that will primarily target iPhones or Android phones and tablets, you might want to consider using Python as your primary language. With this blog post, we’ll cover why this is good choice—and why other options may not be ideal in certain situations.

## Why Python?

Python is a mature, versatile programming language that has been adopted by thousands of businesses and organizations worldwide for a variety of applications.
It’s simple and easy to learn, yet capable of handling large and complex projects. And because it can be applied to various industries and disciplines, it’s a language that can easily transition as your career progresses.
By learning just one programming language, you’ll be able to work in a variety of industries. You’ll also be better positioned to find employment during economic downturns, when companies are forced to reduce their hiring.
This is because there are often fewer job candidates who can speak all the necessary languages.
When you have only one language under your belt, you’ll be able to get a foot in the door at companies where other candidates are rejected because they don’t have the necessary skill sets.

## What is Python?

Python is an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It’s often described as “executable pseudocode,” which means that the code resembles a sort of hybrid between natural language and a more formal programming language. The code can be read and understood like normal sentences, but also follows the syntax and structure of programming languages like C.

Before we go any further, let’s clarify the meaning of open-source. Open-source software is software whose source code is available for anyone to see and modify. The vast majority of modern software is open-source, including languages such as C, C++ and Java. There are also many popular applications that are open-source, such as WordPress, VLC and Firefox.

## why not just use Swift or Java?

There are lots of programming languages that can be used to create mobile apps. But we often hear developers asking “Why use Python for mobile app development?” There are a few programming languages used for app development, but the two most popular choices are Swift and Java. Both of these languages have been around for many years and are used by many developers. So, why not just use one of these languages?

Let’s take a closer look at each language and how it stacks up against Python:

Swift - This Apple-owned programming language was originally created for iOS app development. Swift is a compiled language and uses a runtime system.

Java - This language was created for use in web apps but can also be used for mobile app development. It’s an example of a compiled language and uses a runtime system.

## Key reasons to use Python for mobile development:

- Open source. This is a big one. Many businesses use open source software, and Python happens to be one of the most common languages used in this field.

- Versatile. This language can be used for various disciplines and industries. Companies in different fields can employ Python to create solutions for their business challenges.

- Broad adoption. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages, with thousands of organizations using it for various applications.

- Huge community. Python has a strong and active community that supports and promotes the language.

- Easy to learn. Newcomers to programming often find Python to be an easy language to learn.

- Easy to read. Python code is easy to read and understand, which makes it a good choice for newcomers and experienced developers alike.

## Whats the downside of using Python?

- It’s not always the best choice. In most cases, Python is a solid choice for developers. But there may be situations where it’s not the best option. If you’re creating an app that needs to run at extremely high speeds, C++ might be a better choice.

- The community is growing. Python’s popularity has increased in recent years. This means that more developers are using this language, which may create some challenges for you if you encounter other Python developers on your team.

- Like any language, Python does have its limitations. It’s not the best choice for real-time systems, for example.

## Summing up

With all these benefits and advantages, it’s easy to see why Python is such a popular language for mobile app development. If you’re creating an app that will primarily target iPhones or Android phones and tablets, this is a good choice.

It’s also useful to know that Python is not just for mobile apps. It can also be used for web development, data science and IoT projects. This makes it a useful skill to have in your tool belt, no matter what type of work you do.
