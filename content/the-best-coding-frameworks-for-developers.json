While you might assume that you should write code from scratch to gain the most experience, the fact is that pre-written code can save you a lot of time.\nYou can choose from a variety of coding frameworks, depending on what you\\u2019re working on.\nIn some cases, you might need to slightly modify the code before you use it in your project. However, you can use the majority of frameworks without any modifications. In this case, you simply copy and paste the code into your project.\nWhen you use a coding framework, you\\u2019ll notice that you produce higher-quality work in less time than if you wrote everything from scratch.\nThis can help you meet deadlines and impress clients. Plus, it can help you develop valuable skills that you can use in future projects.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"React Native: The Best Alternative to iOS and Android Apps\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`React Native is one of the top coding frameworks for creating apps. It\\u2019s a JavaScript-based framework that lets developers create native apps for both iOS and Android platforms.\nThis means that you can create apps that look and feel like they were created specifically for each of these operating systems.\nThis app code is then compiled into the language that each OS uses, making the apps fully functional.\nReact Native is one of the fastest ways to create apps that work on multiple platforms. In fact, it\\u2019s almost as fast as creating apps for one specific OS.\nThis coding framework is created and maintained by Facebook, another indication of its high quality.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Swift: Developing Apps For Apple Devices\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Apple\\u2019s Swift is a coding framework for creating apps for iOS devices.

It may be less flexible than React Native, but it\\u2019s still convenient.\nIt\\u2019s also important to note that Swift is a programming language, not a framework. This means that you can use it to create entire apps, including the front-end design and interface.\nThe bottom line: If you want to create apps that run on iOS devices, Swift is a good choice.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Node.JS: Developing Apps For Networked Devices\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Node.JS is a framework for creating networked apps.

Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it\\u2019s important to research multiple options before deciding on a coding framework for your app. It\\u2019s also crucial to select a framework that meets the needs of your client or employer. If possible, ask about their preferred coding framework before you begin coding. It\\u2019s also a good idea to keep an eye on emerging frameworks. New frameworks are created all the time, so it may be possible to use an emerging coding framework to develop an app or software program.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
