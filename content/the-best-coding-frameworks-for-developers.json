While you might assume that you should write code from scratch to gain the most experience, the fact is that pre-written code can save you a lot of time.\nYou can choose from a variety of coding frameworks, depending on what you\\u2019re working on.\nIn some cases, you might need to slightly modify the code before you use it in your project. However, you can use the majority of frameworks without any modifications. In this case, you simply copy and paste the code into your project.\nWhen you use a coding framework, you\\u2019ll notice that you produce higher-quality work in less time than if you wrote everything from scratch.\nThis can help you meet deadlines and impress clients.
