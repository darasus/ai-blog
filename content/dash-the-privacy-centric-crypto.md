summary: Dash is a privacy-driven crypto that has been around since 2014. It is
  one of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world. Dash uses a
  feature called “privacy-by-default” that encrypts transaction data with a
  feature known as DarkSend. This allows users to transact with one another in a
  fully anonymous fashion, making it impossible for outside parties to track
  their transactions. Dash is not 100% anonymous, but it may still be possible
  for law enforcement to identify the ownership of specific addresses.
intro: In the world of cryptocurrency, there are many different digital tokens
  available. Each one has its own unique features and potential uses. There are
  thousands of different investors who have bought into the world of
  cryptocurrency, and each individual has their own reasons for investing in one
  coin or another. Some people invest in specific cryptocurrencies because they
  see a particular use case for that token; others invest in specific coins as a
  hedge against another token; and some invest based on the technical details
  and potential future use case for that token. There are many individuals who
  invest in specific tokens primarily because of their privacy features. Privacy
  is becoming a very important factor to consider when choosing which
  cryptocurrency to buy into, especially now that so many nefarious forces are
  targeting the cryptocurrency community with phishing attacks and hacks. The
  purpose of this article is to explain why you should consider investing in
  Dash, an emerging crypto known as Digital Cash, if you’re looking for a more
  private crypto investment option.

## What is Dash?

Dash is a privacy-driven crypto that has been around since 2014. It is also one of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world. Dash was originally known as Darkcoin and was rebranded in 2015. The “Dash” in the name is a portmanteau that is short for “Digital Cash.” The original goal of the coin was to provide a form of digital cash that could be sent online and would not be as easily traceable as traditional online payment methods. But what is most eye-catching about this coin is its current market cap, which sits at around $4 billion as of July 2018. There are a total of 18.9 million Dash tokens in existence, which are broken down into two different categories:

- 45% of the tokens are owned by the Dash network itself, and are intended to fund future development and incentivize participation in the network.
- The remaining tokens are owned by investors, with the exact breakdown of the distribution of ownership depending on the current market price.

## Why is Privacy Important in a Crypto Investment?

In a digital age where your every transaction is tracked, privacy is a rare and extremely important commodity. Privacy is often overlooked in the digital space, but it is a right that everyone should be entitled to. There are many potential uses for privacy-driven coins, but the most important is the right to privacy. People have the right to transact to their heart’s content, without fear that their information will be used against them. The use of privacy-driven coins is the digital equivalent of paying in cash, which is a method that many people around the world use to shield themselves from fraud and other nefarious forces. Crypto is often heralded as a borderless and frictionless form of currency. Crypto transactions are quick, easy, and relatively cheap, but they are highly traceable. By default, most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are public and transparent. This means that anyone with access to the blockchain can see the entire transaction history of a particular address, including the amount sent, the amount received, and the addresses of the sending and receiving parties. This is a useful feature for law enforcement and other government agencies who want to track illicit activities, but it is a huge privacy concern for the average investor.

## The Problem with Privacy in Crypto

Traditional cryptocurrencies are highly transparent, which means that anyone can see the public ledger of all transactions associated with a particular address. This is a huge problem, as it allows anyone with access to the blockchain to uncover a wealth of private information. This includes the addresses associated with past and present crypto holders, the amount they have spent or received, the exact time of all transactions, the amount of a particular transaction, the blockchain explorer or monitoring service used, and a host of other information. While this transparency is helpful for government agencies and other watchdogs who want to track down illicit activities, it is a huge problem for cryptocurrency investors. It is not illegal to invest in cryptocurrency, but it is also not 100% legal. Depending on where you live, cryptocurrency is either unregulated, partially regulated, or fully banned. Because of this, investors are often targeted by law enforcement agencies who want to track down people who engage in illegal activities using cryptocurrency. Many governments also have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, meaning that investors who want to transact or exchange crypto are required to provide proof of identification to protect against money laundering.

## How Dash Increases Privacy for Users

The privacy-driven nature of Dash is what makes it such a compelling investment option for those who want to keep their transaction history as private as possible. Dash uses a feature called “privacy-by-default” that encrypts transaction data with a feature known as DarkSend, which is similar to peer-to-peer encryption. This allows users to transact with one another in a fully anonymous fashion, making it impossible for outside parties to track their transactions. This is a significant feature that is not available with other privacy-driven cryptocurrencies, making it a very compelling investment option for investors who want to remain as private as possible.

## A Word of Warning: Dash is Not Anonymous

While the privacy features of Dash are very impressive, it’s important to note that it is not 100% anonymous. Due to the public nature of the blockchain, it is possible to track the amount of Dash that has been sent between accounts. This means that it may still be possible for law enforcement to identify the ownership of specific addresses, even if they cannot see the contents of the transactions. While this may not be a concern for some investors, it is important to note that while Dash is one of the most private and secure forms of cryptocurrency, it is not 100% anonymous.

## Dash Has Shown Proven Track Record of Success

Beyond the impressive privacy features of Dash, it is important to note that this coin has proven itself as a legitimate investment opportunity. Dash has been around for several years and has proven itself to be a stable and secure investment. The team behind this coin has proven to be incredibly capable of maintaining development and providing users with regular updates and improvements.

It is important to note that Dash has a strong track record of stability and security, two of the most important factors when considering any new investment option. Beyond the privacy features of Dash, it also has a proven track record of stability and security, two of the most important features of any cryptocurrency investment option.

Dash is one of the most well-known and well-established cryptocurrencies, which means that it has received a huge amount of positive press coverage. This is important because it shows that the general public is becoming increasingly aware of Dash, making this coin a viable investment option for the average investor.

Dash has been around for several years and has proven itself to be a stable and secure investment.
