intro: >-
  Mediation is becoming more and more commonplace as a resolution technique
  for conflict. In fact, numerous experts see mediation as the future of dispute
  resolution. It’s no wonder, then, that businesses are taking note and
  incorporating mediation into their organizational culture as a preemptive
  measure against possible legal action.

  Mediation is a collaborative negotiation process with a neutral third party known as a mediator who helps individuals or parties in conflict reach an agreement that's fair to all involved. Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don’t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.

  Mediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed. If you’re considering implementing mediation in your organization, here are some helpful tips on how to effectively mediate an employee dispute:

## Establish a mediation program and educate employees on its benefits.

Before you begin using mediation to resolve employee disputes, you’ll want to establish a mediation program and ensure employees are aware of it and its benefits. Start by reviewing your organization’s dispute resolution policy to determine the types of disputes that are appropriate for mediation.
Mediation is best used to resolve personal conflicts between two or more employees that do not involve a breach of contract, fraud, or discrimination. You may also want to consider when mediation is most effective for your organization.
Mediation is a good option for resolving disputes when the parties have difficulty communicating or have a poor relationship.

## Set expectations around the process and agree on ground rules.

To ensure the mediation process is productive, it’s important to set clear expectations and agree on ground rules with the mediator and the disputants. The mediator will guide the disputants through the mediation process, while the mediator’s ground rules will guide the participants.
Talk with the mediator ahead of time to determine the number of sessions you’d like to schedule, the length of each session, the location, and any other details that will help the mediation process run smoothly. Then, talk with the disputants to establish ground rules for the mediation session.
Keep in mind that every mediation is different, and the mediator may modify the process as needed to facilitate productive communication between the disputants.

## Appoint an experienced and effective mediator.

Like any other professional service, mediation is a skill that requires training and experience to master. Look for a mediator who has experience resolving a variety of employee disputes and has training in mediation techniques such as active listening, brainstorming, and creative problem solving.
Mediators also come from a variety of professional backgrounds, including law, human resources, mental health, management, and mediation training programs.
When choosing a mediator, be sure to ask about the mediator’s experience with your industry, the types of employee disputes the mediator typically works with, and how long the mediator has been in the field.

## Confidentiality is key to a productive mediation.

Employees will be more likely to participate in the mediation process if they know their communication with the mediator is confidential. The mediator will have to sign a confidentiality agreement to abide by your organization’s privacy policies, but it’s important to reiterate this promise to the disputants, as well.
Mediation is an effective resolution technique for disputes between two or more employees because the process is private. While you are legally required to keep written records of employee complaints, mediation is exempt from this requirement because it is an informal dispute resolution process.
Keep in mind that you may need to disclose confidential information if you are subpoenaed for a court case, provided it is relevant to the case.

## Be flexible and try to incorporate all parties’ interests into the agreement.

During the mediation process, the mediator will likely ask each party what they each want out of the agreement. Be flexible and try to incorporate all parties’ interests into the agreement. You don’t want to force an unwilling party to accept conditions they don’t want.
If mediation is successful, the disputants should have an agreement that both sides are willing to sign. If mediation is unsuccessful, you may still be able to avoid litigation by having the disputants sign a mediation declaration — an agreement that they have engaged in mediation and that they have been unable to reach an agreement.
Although mediation is an effective way to resolve disputes, don’t forget about the other dispute resolution techniques you can use. And, if mediation doesn’t work for you, don’t be discouraged. There are other options available, including arbitration, collaborative problem solving, early neutral evaluation, and litigation.

## Summing up

If you’ve ever encountered an employee dispute, you know how difficult and emotionally draining they can be. Mediation is an excellent way to resolve disputes between employees. Before you implement mediation, though, you’ll want to establish a mediation program, set expectations around the process, and appoint an experienced and effective mediator. Confidentiality is key to a productive mediation, and be flexible and try to incorporate all parties’ interests into the agreement. Mediation is an effective resolution technique for disputes between two or more employees.
