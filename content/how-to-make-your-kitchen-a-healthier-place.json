Whether in a home, restaurant, cafeteria or any other eatery, almost all food establishments serve high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat meals that are laden with salt and unhealthy oils.What is unfortunate about this situation is that many people have no choice but to eat this way on a regular basis. If you work in an office, it\\u2019s highly likely that your building has its own kitchen where a catered lunch service prepares hot lunches for staff every day. Similarly, if you go to school, there will most likely be a canteen serving the same type of unhealthy food as an adult educational institution.The good news is that even if you are stuck eating these foods on a daily basis, you can make your kitchen a healthier place by altering what goes into the meals you cook at home and the ones that you buy.

Instead of buying unhealthy ready meals, buy fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, and healthy grains like whole-wheat pasta and brown rice. Fresh produce and grains will be cheaper than frozen and ready meals, and they re-usable, so they will save you money in the long term.\nInstead of buying frozen vegetables, buy fresh vegetables. Frozen vegetables are often blanched before being frozen, which can reduce their nutritional content and flavor. Fresh vegetables, on the other hand, retain their fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while also remaining cheaper.\nInstead of buying unhealthy oils and animal fats, buy healthy oils like olive oil and vegetable oil. Similarly, instead of buying high-fat cheeses, buy low-fat or reduced-fat versions of your favorite cheeses. While these may be more expensive than their full-fat equivalents, they will be healthier, and you will also be able to reduce the overall calories in your meals.\nInstead of buying unhealthy processed snacks, grab some nuts or dried fruit.

Extra virgin olive oil is healthy and will not only improve the taste of your food, but it will also help you to improve your diet.\nUse basil and garlic in place of butter and other unhealthy fats in vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.
