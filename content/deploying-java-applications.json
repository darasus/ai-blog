They create, maintain and update the software that powers businesses, websites and apps. And demand for software engineers continues to grow. Job postings for software engineers have increased by 37 percent in the last five years, with an additional 26 percent increase expected by 2024.\nSoftware engineering is also one of the most competitive fields to break into at the moment. There is a shortage of skilled candidates, which has led to high demand and high salaries for top software engineers who can drive innovation in their companies. To become a software engineer and land one of those coveted jobs, you will need to complete a computer science degree or take up coding classes.

They make it possible for developers to solve problems by creating programs directly instead of writing instructions word-by-word. There are numerous programming languages out there but one that has become particularly useful for game development is Go. It has many features that make it an excellent choice for developing video games, including its simplicity, type inference, and great support for Unicode.
