They demand that it must be fast, secure, and scalable to support current and future users. They also need deployment to be convenient, efficient, and fully automated.\nWith all of the modern application development tools and frameworks available today, deploying Java applications should be straightforward. Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don\\u2019t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Manual deployments can be time-consuming and expensive if you have a large team of developers.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Staging Environment\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`A staging environment is a replica of your production environment. It is used to test your software before you make it available to your users. Staging environments can be manual or automated.\nIf staging is manual, you need to manually deploy a fresh copy of your software to a different network segment or server on a regular basis. You also need to manually test the software to ensure that it works as expected.\nStaging environments provide some level of scalability, but they are still prone to human error. They are difficult to maintain and scale up, because you have to do it manually.\nStaging environments are best for simple applications that don\\u2019t have rigorous testing requirements.

It typically pulls code from a code repository like GitHub or Bitbucket at regular intervals and builds the application.

If the tests pass, the continuous integration server deploys the latest version of the application to a staging environment.\nDepending on the configuration, continuous integration servers can send the deployment files to the hosting environment.
