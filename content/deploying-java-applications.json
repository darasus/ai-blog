  "summary": "A staging environment is a replica of your production environment to test your software before you make it available to your users. Staging environments can be manual or automated. Continuous integration servers automate the build and deployment process. CDNs help distribute your application’s static content on a global network of servers close to users. Bintray and Nexus Repository Manager services support software development kits and tools like Gradle, Maven, and Jenkins.

  "intro": "Today’s enterprises demand more from their software. They demand that it must be fast, secure, and scalable to support current and future users. They also need deployment to be convenient, efficient, and fully automated.\nWith all of the modern application development tools and frameworks available today, deploying Java applications should be straightforward. Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don’t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.",
  "content": "## Manual Processes\n\nManual processes are the easiest to implement, but also offer the least amount of flexibility and scalability. As the name suggests, you manually kick off the deployment process from your laptop or desktop.\nThere are no automated deployments in a manual process. Manual deployments are susceptible to human error, and lack any sort of version control. It’s difficult to track the changes made to each deployed version of your application. Manual deployments can be time-consuming and expensive if you have a large team of developers.\n\n## Staging Environment\n\nA staging environment is a replica of your production environment. It is used to test your software before you make it available to your users. Staging environments can be manual or automated.\nIf staging is manual, you need to manually deploy a fresh copy of your software to a different network segment or server on a regular basis. You also need to manually test the software to ensure that it works as expected.\nStaging environments provide some level of scalability, but they are still prone to human error. They are difficult to maintain and scale up, because you have to do it manually.\nStaging environments are best for simple applications that don’t have rigorous testing requirements. They are not well-suited for apps with complex deployment requirements.\n\n## Continuous Integration Server\n\nA continuous integration server automates the build and deployment process. It typically pulls code from a code repository like GitHub or Bitbucket at regular intervals and builds the application. It then runs unit tests that verify that the application performs as expected.\nIf the tests fail, the continuous integration server halts the deployment process. If the tests pass, the continuous integration server deploys the latest version of the application to a staging environment.\nDepending on the configuration, continuous integration servers can send the deployment files to the hosting environment. Some continuous integration servers allow you to select where to deploy your application and what server to use.\n\n## CDNs\n\nCDNs help distribute your application’s static content, such as images and CSS/JS libraries. They host your application’s static content on a global network of servers close to your users. This improves the user experience by decreasing download times.\nCDNs can also help distribute your application’s dynamic content. Some CDNs support modern application architectures, such as microservices and serverless applications.\nSome CDNs also provide an API that you can use to trigger builds and trigger the deployment process. This allows you to automate the build and deployment process.\nIf you use a CDN to host your application, be sure to select a provider that supports Java. You should also select a provider that supports your preferred application architecture.\n\n## Bintray and Nexus Repository Manager\n\nBintray and Nexus Repository Manager allow you to host your application’s static assets on a third-party cloud service like AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage. You can configure your application to retrieve the static assets from these services using environment variables.\nBintray and Nexus Repository Manager also allow you to deploy your application using a simple API. You can use an API key to trigger the deployment process.\nSome Bintray and Nexus Repository Manager services support software development kits and tools like Gradle, Maven, and Jenkins. Bintray and Nexus Repository Manager support a wide variety of programming languages, including Java.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJava applications excel at handling real-world business problems and are widely used for enterprise-level applications and websites. Since its inception, the Java language has been constantly growing and evolving alongside the IT industry. With each new iteration, the language brings innovative new features and tools, helping developers to create more robust, easier-to-maintain code.\nThese days, with the growing popularity of microservices and serverless architectures, deploying Java applications is both simple and flexible. There are many ways you can deploy Java applications, from traditional manual processes to fully automated continuous integration servers."
