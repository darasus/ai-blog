The road to success is never an easy one, and the same goes for learning new skills. If you have been thinking of learning Javascript but are not sure where to start, this post will guide you through the process and help you get there.\nThe programming language Javascript is most commonly used to add interactive features and dynamic content to website pages and internet applications. However, many people think it\\u2019s difficult to understand because of its weird syntax and strange naming conventions. But that doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t learn it!\nIt is a high-level programming language that can be used to create interactive websites, video games, computer programs, artificial intelligence systems, and more. It was invented by Netscape in 1995 so that their programmers could document their code better and make their website faster by eliminating the need for browser plugins like ActiveX or Java applets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
