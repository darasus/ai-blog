"Birdman" is a darkly comic meditation on fame and ego. The film follows Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a washed-up actor who once played an iconic superhero, as he attempts to mount a Broadway play in a desperate bid to reclaim his past glory. The play, however, is a disaster, and Riggan's ego is further battered by the critical drubbing it receives. He is also haunted by the ghost of his former superhero character, Birdman, who taunts him incessantly.

As the play teeters on the brink of collapse, Riggan's sanity begins to unravel, and he starts to believe that he actually is Birdman. The film culminates in a spectacularly surreal sequence in which Riggan takes flight, literally and figuratively, as he comes to terms with his own mortality.

"Birdman" is a brilliant and darkly funny film that explores the nature of fame and the human ego. Michael Keaton gives a tour-de-force performance as Riggan Thomson, and the supporting cast is equally excellent. The film is visually stunning, and the use of long takes adds to the sense of unease and paranoia that pervades the story. "Birdman" is a must-see film for anyone interested in exploring the dark side of human nature.
