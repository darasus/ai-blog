  "content": "## But first: Why is making a perfect pie crust so important?\n\nWhen it comes to desserts, pies are probably one of the most iconic and recognizable classic dishes. There are tons of variations of the pie, but almost all of them (with the exception of the cheesecake) have the same main component: a crust.\nOf course, crusts are not just decorative. They are actually fundamental to the success of any pie. The crust acts as a wrapping for the filing, holding it in place as it bakes and keeping the pie together as you slice it at the end.\nThe crust is also the part of the pie you taste first, so it needs to be delicious. Otherwise, you’ve just ruined what could have been a really great dessert!\n## The secrets to flaky perfection\n\nThere are many different types of pie crusts you can make, but one of the most common and classic is the all-butter crust. You can use butter or a mixture of butter and shortening if you like, and the difference between the two is mostly in texture—shortening makes the crust a little more tender.\nIt’s not just the type of fat in your crust that matters, but also how you mix and handle the dough. Achieving perfect flakiness is all about the dough-to-fat ratio, the temperature of the ingredients, and the way you work the dough.\n\n## How to make a tender and flaky pie crust\n\nIf the idea of making a homemade pie crust makes you nervous, all you need to do is follow a few simple steps. A well-made crust is all about the process.\nIt’s easy enough to make a homemade crust, even if you have never done it before. You can make a sweet crust, or you can try baking a savory pie crust.\nThe key to a really great crust is using a lot of butter in a ratio of 2 parts butter to 3 parts flour. You can also add a little bit of water.\n\n## How to avoid shrinkage when baking a pie\n\nWhen a pie crust shrinks, it can make your pie look a little less than perfect. You can avoid this by making sure you use enough flour and butter in your dough. You can also add a little bit of sugar, which can help the crust stay in place better.\nAnother trick to avoid shrinkage is to put the pie in the freezer for about 20 minutes before you bake it. This will help the crust stay in place, and will make sure that the butter doesn’t melt before you put the pie in the oven.\n\n## Tips for making the best savory pie crust\n\nWhen baking savory pies, you can use almost any type of crust. It can be made from almost any type of flour (like rye or spelt), and most people like to add some sort of fat, like butter or shortening. Some recipes also call for a pinch of salt or a dash of olive oil.\nSome people like to add a little bit of water to their dough so that it can be easily rolled out. If you add too much water, however, your crust will be too soft and be difficult to work with.\n\n## Recipes for delicious sweet fillings\n\nWhen it comes to sweet fillings, the only limit is your imagination. You can use almost any type of fruit, add some chocolate, or even try some savory combinations.\nHere are a few of our favorite ideas:\n\n- Apple and blackberry: Apples and blackberries are a classic pairing, and in this recipe, you just need to add some cinnamon for a perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors.\n- Pecan and caramel: This is another classic flavor combo, and it’s perfect for anybody who loves a caramel apple.\n- Rhubarb: Rhubarb is something that very few people have ever tried, but it is a delicious, tart flavor that works great in a pie.\n- Nutella: Chocolate and hazelnut are a classic pairing, and this recipe is simple enough that even a beginner can make it.\n- Mascarpone: This rich and creamy Italian cheese makes for a perfect creamy filling for any pie.\n\n## Recipe ideas for delicious savory fillings\n\nThese savory fillings are made with a crust, but they are not sweet. You can experiment with any combination of these ingredients to make your own unique savory pie.\n\n- Quiche: A quiche is basically a savory custard, and it is great for breakfast or brunch. You can put almost anything in a quiche, and it will taste great.\n- Potato and leek: This is a great winter pie that is surprisingly easy to make. It also happens to be very rich and hearty.\n- Corn and chorizo: This is a Mexican twist on a classic holiday pie. It’s easy to make and can be eaten warm or cold.\n- Vegetable and cheese: Vegetables like broccoli, zucchini, and carrots make great fillings for savory pies. You can add Parmesan or another type of cheese to make it even better.\n\n## Ideas for tasty toppings\n\nThere are tons of ways to top a pie, but when you’re making your own crust, there are only a few ways to do it effectively.\nYou can use just about any type of fruit for a topping. Apples and pears are a classic choice, but you can also try peaches, plums, or even strawberries. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can top your pie with a handful of nuts or even some chocolate chips.\n\nYou can also make a simple glaze for your pie, or you can add some whipped cream for a creamier topping, or even ice cream for something even more indulgent. Whichever way you go, you’re sure to make your homemade pie look and taste great."
