Unfortunately, many people also associate salads with bad food because they\\u2019ve had so many disappointing experiences eating them in the past. That\\u2019s because most salads we see today are either served in large fast-food containers or come with an enormous amount of dressing that you need a spoon to get out of the little plastic tub.\nHowever, there\\u2019s no reason why salads have to be boring, sad excuses for food. In fact, a good salad can be one of the healthiest and most satisfying ways to eat greens \\u2013 as long as you know how make it taste great without making it worse for you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But what you eat also plays a huge role in how quickly or slowly your weight loss comes off. What you put on your plate is critical because every food has a set amount of calories and specific nutrients \\u2014 not all foods are created equal. Some foods help you lose weight faster and keep it off, while others have the opposite effect, either because they are high in sugar, fat or calories, or because they have very little nutritional value.\nSuch dietetic staples as broccoli and blueberries are great for losing weight.

However, the word \\u2018processed\\u2019 can be misleading.\nProcessed foods almost always have a shorter shelf life than their unprocessed counterparts.

Processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy and unprocessed foods aren\\u2019t always healthy.\nProcessing can take many forms. Some examples of processed foods include canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, oils that have been refined or hydrogenated (as in Crisco), salt, sugar and starch that has been extracted from its original source (as in corn syrup or white sugar), spices that have been ground up, protein that has had artificial flavors or preservatives added to it (as in MSG), or food that has had artificial colors added to it (such as Red 40).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
