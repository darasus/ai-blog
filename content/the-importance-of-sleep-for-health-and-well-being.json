  "content": "## What is Sleep and Why is it so Important?\n\nWhen we talk about sleep, we are actually referring to two different things. The first is sleep itself, which is a naturally-occurring state of restful consciousness. The other is the need for sleep, which is regulated by circadian rhythm.\n\nSleep is a biological process regulated by the body. During the natural sleep process, your blood pressure, the body’s temperature and oxygen levels drop. At the same time, your body releases certain hormones, including serotonin, which helps regulate your mood.\nIn order for your body to function properly and properly regulate itself, it needs a certain amount of sleep each day. Different people need different amounts of sleep.

Sleep is so important for your general health because it regulates your hormones, digestion, metabolism and immune system.\nSleep can also prevent the onset of certain diseases.
