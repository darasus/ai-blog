Super cool, right? Well, sort of. If you\\u2019re like most adults and teens, you probably don\\u2019t have time to pack your own lunch every day. Instead, many of us rely on fast food or convenience stores for our midday meal. While this can be an affordable and convenient option, these places often offer unhealthy food loaded with salt and fat.\nFortunately, there are more healthy options out there than you might think. These days there are many drive-through restaurants that serve much healthier versions of the standard fast food menu items. Cafeterias in offices, schools, libraries and other public places also tend to offer healthy choices as well as salad bars and other stations where you can make your own healthy salads or sandwiches.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
