Famous celebrities, athletes and even foodies are swearing off meat and animal products to lead a more plant-based life.\nThis practice is also known as \\u201Cveganism\\u201D or an \\u201Cethical vegan\\u201D diet.

Some people feel that this diet is the best way to reduce their carbon footprint and live in harmony with nature. Others see it as a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet (SAD).\nMany simply like the taste of plants more than meat.

Look for sales in that store before you go and stock up on foods that are good value. You might even consider investing in a membership card or becoming an insider or club member so you get vouchers or other discounts.
