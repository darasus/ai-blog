  "summary": "Desktop applications built with the Spring MVC framework are typically web applications intended to be run inside a desktop environment. They are usually accessed by the user through a browser, and then the desktop application is launched within the browser itself. This type of architecture allows the user to have access to the entire functionality of the. desktop application, while only being constrained by the web browser they are using. The most straightforward route would be to build a “Spring Boot Based Desktop. GUI Application” The Desktop. application will be built using the default settings of a Spring Boot project and no configuration changes will be required.",
