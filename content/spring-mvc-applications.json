New types of cloud services are also emerging every day.\nA majority of organizations now use cloud services as part of their IT strategy. From handling peak demand to reducing costs and improving availability, cloud-based services have proven their worth for many businesses. Even so, making the move can be challenging for IT professionals and software developers.

These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems.
