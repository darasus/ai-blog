That\\u2019s because creating a new programming language is a challenging process. Creating a language that has its own syntax, parser, compiler, and virtual machine is not easy.\nIt\\u2019s even harder to create a programming language that other people want to use. The Java programming language has been around for almost 25 years now, and it\\u2019s still going strong. There are many good reasons for this, but one of the most important is that Java doesn\\u2019t try to be everything to everyone. Its scope is limited, but its potential is vast.\nThis article will introduce you to the Java programming language so you can understand why it remains one of the most popular languages in the world today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
