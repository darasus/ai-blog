  "summary": "Python is a general-purpose programming language that is commonly used for data analysis. It has an extensive library for data manipulation, allowing you to perform many tasks, such as cleaning data, tokenizing text, and transforming images. You can also use Python for data mining to explore your data and find any hidden trends or anomalies. While Python is ideal for data. analysis, itâ€™s not great for other tasks such as website development. Python is also quite slow, so it takes longer to execute tasks than other languages.",
