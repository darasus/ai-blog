Mediation is a process whereby two or more parties in conflict meet with a neutral third party, the mediator, in an attempt to resolve their differences. The mediator’s role is to facilitate communication and help the parties find a resolution.

Mediation can be used to resolve conflicts in a variety of settings, including businesses, families, schools, and community organizations. It is often used as an alternative to litigation, as it is typically less expensive and time-consuming.

There are many benefits to mediation, including:

1. It can help parties in conflict to communicate more effectively.

2. It can help parties to understand each other’s perspectives.

3. It can help parties to identify common ground and areas of agreement.

4. It can help parties to generate creative solutions to their conflict.

5. It can help parties to feel heard and respected.

6. It can help parties to maintain control over the outcome of their conflict.

7. It can help parties to avoid the negative consequences of litigation, such as time-consuming and expensive court proceedings.

If you are in conflict with someone, mediation may be a helpful option for you to consider.
