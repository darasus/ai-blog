The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Unfortunately, many people in their situation have been forced from their homes as a result of foreclosures.\nSteinbeck describes the harsh realities of the journey west in overloaded cars, with very little money or food, and meeting other people with similar situations.
