The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Films like \\u201CSelma\\u201D are necessary to remind viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents. The town was also home to Selma\\u2019s most famous resident at the time: Collin W. Lewis, also known as \\u201Cthe Lion of Selma\\u201D \\u2013 a prominent civil rights leader who had grown up there after his family fled Greenwood as part of the Great Migration from 1916-1921. In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
