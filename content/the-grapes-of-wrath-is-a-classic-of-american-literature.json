The novel was published in 1940 at the height of the Great Depression when millions of Americans were either unemployed or working on a very low income. It was also a time when many Americans were experiencing poverty and hardship. The book described the suffering of the workers through the Joad family â€“ a fictional family that was representative of many of the migrants.

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Unfortunately, many people in their situation have been forced from their homes as a result of foreclosures.\nSteinbeck describes the harsh realities of the journey west in overloaded cars, with very little money or food, and meeting other people with similar situations. A major theme in the novel is the difficulty of moving with a large family and having no money. As a result, the family is forced to camp in fields, work in labor gangs, and move on when they are noticed by the police.\nSteinbeck describes how the migrants\\u2019 journey west is one of hope and dreams of better opportunities.

However, that doesn\\u2019t mean there hasn\\u2019t been some brilliant albums released so far this year. While last year had some incredible albums (like Kendrick Lamar\\u2019s \\u201CDamn,\\u201D Lorde\\u2019s \\u201CMelodrama,\\u201D and Noel Gallagher\\u2019s High Flying Birds' \"Who Built the Moon?\"), this year hasn\\u2019t quite matched up to those standards. However, we are only halfway through the year and as such, we have also seen some fantastic new albums released in the last few months that are worth mentioning. There may not be many great new albums out at the moment \\u2013 but these five are definitely among the best.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Today, there are more ways than ever to access and enjoy hip-hop music; from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to video sharing sites like YouTube, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
