The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Alejandro Gonz\\xE1lez I\\xF1\\xE1rritu has crafted a brutal and beautifully shot masterwork about the lengths we will go to for love and revenge.\nDelving into themes of man vs nature, \\u201CThe Revenant\\u201D features amazing performances from a cast that spends most of their screen time fighting the elements. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
