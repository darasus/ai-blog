The novel was published in 1940 at the height of the Great Depression when millions of Americans were either unemployed or working on a very low income. It was also a time when many Americans were experiencing poverty and hardship. The book described the suffering of the workers through the Joad family â€“ a fictional family that was representative of many of the migrants.

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Unfortunately, many people in their situation have been forced from their homes as a result of foreclosures.\nSteinbeck describes the harsh realities of the journey west in overloaded cars, with very little money or food, and meeting other people with similar situations. A major theme in the novel is the difficulty of moving with a large family and having no money. As a result, the family is forced to camp in fields, work in labor gangs, and move on when they are noticed by the police.\nSteinbeck describes how the migrants\\u2019 journey west is one of hope and dreams of better opportunities.

The number of subgenres and variations within the larger genres is innumerable. It\\u2019s also an industry that has recently come under fire for its lack of diversity and representation in regards to gender, sexuality, religion, race, and so much more. As a result of these issues becoming more apparent and publicized, artists have been producing music with a purpose; focusing on important topics and causes through their music.\nIf you spend any time listening to rap or hip-hop music, you\\u2019ve probably noticed how many songs are about money, sex, drugs, partying\\u2014basically all the things you can do when you\\u2019re rich and famous. But there are some rappers who are using their fame to make a difference in the world by speaking out about problems that need to be addressed: social injustice, poverty, drug abuse, child exploitation and other serious issues. These artists are making a conscious effort to use their music to make a positive impact on society rather than just focusing on things like materialism or promiscuity.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days. From vampires to werewolves to Frankenstein\\u2019s monster and his re-imagined counterpart, Victor Frankenstein, there isn\\u2019t much left that hasn\\u2019t already been done multiple times before. In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.
