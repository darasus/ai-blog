This can be applied to a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrency tokens, land titles, securities, supply chain inventory, and more. With smart assets, you can program them to transfer ownership to another person, release a certain amount of tokens to someone, or execute other actions when certain conditions are met. If a person buys a share of stock, for example, the smart asset can be programmed to release some amount of the same cryptocurrency to that person.
