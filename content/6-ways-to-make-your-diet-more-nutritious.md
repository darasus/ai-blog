## Add more fruits and vegetables to your diet.

Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that can help prevent a number of diseases, including heart ailments and certain cancers. Studies have also shown that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits can help reduce your risk of diabetes by as much as 40-50% and cut your risk of stroke by 10%. Furthermore, they are also low in calories, so you can add them to your diet without feeling guilty! So, if you’re looking to improve the nutritional value of your diet, start by adding more fruits and vegetables to your daily menu.

## Incorporate more whole grains into your diet.

Whole grains are high in fibre and an excellent source of minerals and B vitamins, which are essential for a healthy and balanced diet. They are also good for regulating blood sugar levels, which makes them perfect for people who are at risk of developing diabetes. If you are concerned about the amount of grains in your diet, you might be surprised to know that there is no need to give up on the idea of a “healthy diet”. There are many options now available in the market, including sprouted grains, oat groats, barley, brown rice and millet, just to name a few. You can also try baking your own whole grain breads and baking mixes to make your daily diet more nutritious.

## Have a protein shake for breakfast.

Getting enough protein in your diet is challenging, especially if you don’t eat meat or fish. However, you can fulfill your protein requirements with ease by enthusing a protein shake in the morning before you head out for work. A protein shake contains ample amounts of protein, which is essential for maintaining a healthy metabolism, along with fibre and minerals, such as calcium and iron. You can make a protein shake at home by adding oats, almond milk, flaxseed, protein powder and some berries to it. If you are looking for more protein, you can also add peanut butter, yogurt or chia seeds to your shake.

## Make a point of eating lean protein.

There are many ways in which you can incorporate more protein in your diet, but you should make sure that it is lean protein. Why? Because eating too much protein can actually increase the risk of developing kidney and liver damage! The recommended daily allowance of protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, which amounts to 56 grams for a person who is weighing 70 kilograms. You can incorporate more lean protein in your daily diet by adding beans, lentils, tofu, dairy products, eggs, fish, lean meat and poultry to your diet.

## Try intermittent fasting once or twice a week.

This might sound like an odd way to improve the nutritional value of your diet, but it has proven to be extremely effective. Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern where you engage in an extended period of time without eating followed by a shorter period of time when you consume food. The most common method is to restrict eating for 16 hours and then consuming all of your daily calories in an 8-hour period. Many studies have shown that intermittent fasting can improve the regulation of blood sugar, help fight hypertension and reduce your risk of developing heart disease.

Intermittent fasting also helps you to improve the nutritional value of your diet by increasing your intake of fibre and vitamins, such as B and C. It also encourages you to eat more fibre, which can help you to lose weight faster.

## Be selective with your carbs.

When you’re trying to improve the nutritional value of your diet, it is important to pay attention to the types of carbs that you are consuming. It’s a commonly held belief that all carbs are bad for you, but that is not true. There are two different types of carbs that you can choose from: simple carbs and complex carbs. Simple carbs are high in sugar, which can be converted into fat if you don’t burn it off through physical activity. Complex carbs, on the other hand, are full of fibre and are digested slowly, which helps you to stay full for a longer period of time. You can make your diet more nutritious by opting for complex carbs over simple carbs when you are choosing your favourite dishes from your go-to restaurants.

## Bottom line

In a nutshell, there are many ways in which you can improve the nutritional value of your diet. You can add more fruits and vegetables to your daily meals, incorporate more whole grains into your diet, make a point of eating lean protein and be selective with your carbs. By making these changes, you can start seeing positive changes in your overall health.
