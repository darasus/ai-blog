If you're looking to make your diet more nutritious, there are a few things you can do. Here are six ways to make your diet more nutritious:

1. Eat more fruits and vegetables.

Fruits and vegetables are packed with nutrients that are essential for good health. Aim to fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables at every meal.

2. Choose whole grains.

Whole grains are a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When choosing grain products, look for those that list a whole grain as the first ingredient.

3. Include lean protein.

Lean protein provides essential amino acids that our bodies need. Good sources of lean protein include chicken, fish, tofu, and legumes.

4. Get your calcium-rich foods.

Calcium is important for strong bones and teeth. Good sources of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese.

5. Add some healthy fats to your diet.

Healthy fats are an important part of a nutritious diet. They help our bodies absorb vitamins and minerals, and they provide energy. Good sources of healthy fats include nuts, seeds, and avocados.

6. Drink plenty of water.

Water is essential for good health. It helps our bodies function properly and helps to flush out toxins. Aim to drink eight glasses of water each day.
