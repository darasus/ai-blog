## Eat breakfast

Breakfast is often called the most important meal of the day, and for very good reason. Your body needs to replenish itself after a long night of sleep, and breakfast provides the fuel for it to do so. But that’s not all that a good breakfast has going for it. Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast tend to be healthier in general. They have less diabetes, less hypertension, and less obesity than people who don’t eat breakfast.
You should eat breakfast no later than 9 AM. Ideally, you should eat breakfast before 8 AM so that the body has enough time to process the meal before you head off to work. This will ensure that you have plenty of energy and that your metabolism is at its best.

## Don’t forget your veggies

Vegetables are essential when it comes to a healthy diet. They are loaded with vitamins and minerals that are essential for good health. Vegetables are also very low in calories, making them ideal for weight loss. You should aim to eat at least two servings of vegetables per day. A serving is roughly half a cup of vegetables, or two carrots.
Vegetables can be eaten as a side dish with your meal, a snack, or added to a meal that you are cooking. Vegetables are incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. In fact, some dishes would be incomplete without them. Potatoes, for example, are used in many popular dishes.
Vegetables should ideally be eaten raw, as cooking them will usually diminish their nutritional value. You can eat them as a salad, a side dish, or even added to your smoothie to add some extra nutrients to your drink.

## Watch your portions

One of the biggest mistakes many people make when trying to increase the nutritional value of their diet is eating more, thinking that more is better. While it is true that you do need more of certain nutrients, it is also true that an excess of these will cause more harm than good. A good rule of thumb is to follow what your body is telling you. For example, you might be able to eat two or three servings of vegetables a day. You can also use a portion guide to help you.
You should also keep in mind that calories will remain calories no matter which nutrients they are made of. You can have a really nutritious meal with a ton of vegetables, but if you eat too much of it, it will be just as bad as if you had a meal full of empty calories.

## Choose whole grains

Whole grains are foods that are made from the entire grain, including the germ and the bran. When grains are milled and refined, many of the essential nutrients are lost. Whole grains have more fiber, protein, B vitamins, and iron than grains that have been milled and refined.
You can eat whole grains in many different ways. You can add oats to your breakfast cereal, eat some whole wheat bread, or even add some quinoa to your salad.
You should also make sure to look out for foods that say “made with whole grains” on the label. Many companies have started to use this label to show that their products are made with whole grains.

## Don’t forget the protein

Protein is essential to good health, and very few foods contain it naturally. This means that you need to make sure you are getting enough protein in your diet. A good general rule is to aim for one protein source per meal. When you choose your protein, make sure it is lean.
You can get your protein in many different ways. You can add beans to your salad, have a chicken breast with your meal, or even drink protein shakes if you don’t have the time to sit down and eat a meal.

## Stay away from processed foods

Processed foods are any foods that have been modified from their natural state. Many processed foods are high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats and low in nutrients. These foods are definitely not nutritious and can actually have a negative effect on your health.
You can avoid processed foods by choosing freshly made meals whenever possible. If you do buy processed foods, try to find ones that are low in sodium and sugar and high in nutrients.

## Conclusion

A healthy diet is essential to living a long and happy life. You can boost the nutritional value of your diet by following these tips and tricks. Eat more fiber, eat more veggies, and eat more whole grains. Make sure you are eating enough protein, and stay away from processed foods. With these tips in mind, you can easily amp up the nutritional value of your diet.
