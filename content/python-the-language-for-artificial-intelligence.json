It was originally developed at Google to solve some of the problems with other programming languages like C and Python that made it difficult to write programs that are fast, small, and correct.\nGo makes it easy to capture the programmer\\u2019s intent in code and generate output directly from source - thanks to its lightweight syntax, concise statement, and built-in support for anonymous functions without the need for temporary variables or auxiliary arguments.\nGo is generally regarded as a modern programming language, which means that it has been designed with performance in mind, comes with support for concurrency, and implements new features introduced by other recent programming languages like Rust and Swift. The factors listed above make Go an excellent choice for software development projects involving medium-to-large sized codebases, performance optimization, or writing compilers.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems. The latest technology being adopted by both enterprises and developers is the Internet of Things (IoT).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
