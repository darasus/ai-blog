In practice, this means a website like Google can store all of its user-friendly information online and anyone who wants to access it simply needs to type in a URL or visit a site directly. However, as more people use the internet and begin interacting with various programs and applications on websites, things become slightly more complicated.\nAs you probably know if you browse social media sites or read news articles online frequently, there are now several different \\u201Clanguages\\u201D being used on websites to make them more interactive.

It will enable faster and more reliable connectivity, in much the same way that 3G and 4G did before it. 5G is particularly exciting because of how fast it will be when it\\u2019s fully implemented. While 4G introduced much faster speeds, 5G is 10 times as fast again.
