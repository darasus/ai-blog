This is great if you were in the middle of working on a document and forgot to save it before you shut the computer down.\nIf you\\u2019re planning on storing your Macbook for a long period of time without using it, it\\u2019s best to shut the computer down instead of storing it in sleep mode.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t run your Macbook Pro on the factory battery\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`This mistake is a little different from the others on this list because it doesn\\u2019t really have anything to do with how you use the computer, it has to do with the type of battery you have inside your laptop.

This type of battery is very different from the standard lithium-ion battery that most other laptops have. The standard kind of lithium-ion battery can be charged up to around 2,000 times while lithium-polymer batteries can only be charged up to 500 times before they need to be replaced.\nIf you have one of these higher capacity batteries, you should be aware that it will wear down faster than a standard battery.
