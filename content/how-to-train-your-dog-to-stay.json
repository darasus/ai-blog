It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user.

If left unattended, this dirt and oil will cause your dog to smell and leave them more susceptible to infections. Grooming your dog regularly can also help you identify any problems they might have with their skin or fur early on. To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every one to three months.\nThe benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence.
