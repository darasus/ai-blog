But even with all of these fantastic innovations, most dogs will eventually get tired of playing with their toys and will look for something more interesting. This is where training comes in!\nTo train your dog means to instruct them in some behavior that you want them to repeat consistently in different situations. Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like \\u201Csit\\u201D or \\u201Cstay,\\u201D or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard.

Make sure you have the proper mindset, and you are prepared for what comes next. It\\u2019s best to start this when your dog is young. This will make it easier for them to learn.

Keep this exercise relatively short, and don\\u2019t push your dog too hard.

Once they are looking at you, you can ask them to sit again and give them another treat. This is a very effective way to train dogs, especially if you have a dog who is easily distracted. You can also use a method called tethering. With this method, you tether your dog to you with a short leash. When your dog tries to get up, they end up getting pulled back down by the leash. This method is a little controversial, so if you choose to use it, make sure you are careful not to overuse it.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Bottom Line\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Training your dog can be a lot of fun, and it can be very rewarding to see your dog learn new things and respond to commands.
