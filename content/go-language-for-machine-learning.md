Go is a great language for machine learning because it is easy to learn and has a lot of features that are perfect for this type of programming. For example, Go has a built-in support for concurrency, which is perfect for training large neural networks. Additionally, Go's garbage collector makes it easy to manage memory usage when working with large data sets.
