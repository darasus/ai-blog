These are also some of the most challenging and difficult ones to make. Cracking the code on how to build a well-crafted and engaging video game requires practice, ingenuity, skill, and patience. But not every developer is up to the task. Some simply fail at creating an entertaining experience for players. This list compiles some of the disappointments from 2018 that failed to meet an acceptable standard of quality.\nThese are the worst games of 2018, broken down by category and listed in no particular order. Some might have had good intentions or interesting concepts, but fell short in their execution.
