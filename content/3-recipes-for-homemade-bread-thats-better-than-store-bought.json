Contestants are asked to make pastry-based dishes that often feature unusual or difficult techniques, and are judged on appearance, taste and originality. In each episode they face two different challenges: a Signature Bake where they must create something using a specific ingredient or theme as inspiration; and a Technical Challenge which might see them making croquembouche or another difficult dish.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
