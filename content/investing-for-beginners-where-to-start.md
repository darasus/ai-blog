intro: You can either love it or hate it. But investing is something that we all
  have to deal with at some point in our lives. If you’re someone who likes
  math, logic, and problem-solving – and doesn’t shy away from risk – then maybe
  investing is for you. For the rest of us, however, the idea of investing can
  seem a little bit scary. But don’t worry; investing is much simpler than most
  people think, especially if you have a basic understanding of how personal
  finance works. Keeping a detailed record of your money isn’t difficult and
  every person should invest their earnings for the future. Whether you have $5
  or $500 to invest as a beginner, there are lots of great places to put that
  money so that it can grow over time. The trick is knowing which investment
  options are best for you and your circumstances...

## What is investing?

Investing is putting your money into something in the hopes that it will make money and then you can use that money to achieve financial goals in the future. Every time you put your money into an investment, there is risk involved. The amount you make from each investment is not guaranteed.
There are many different types of investments that you can put your money into. The best way to find out what is best for you is to research different investment types and find out what is most profitable for you.

## How to invest your money

When you first start investing, don’t put all your money into one type of investment. Start out small with a variety of investments so that if one doesn’t do so well, the others can hopefully make up for it.
Keep your eyes open for new investment opportunities as they arise and always do your research before you invest any money. You don’t want to put your money into something only to find out that it’s not a good investment or that it’s too risky for your liking.

## Stash your cash in a savings account

A savings account is a great place to start investing if you have very little money to spare. Most banks offer savings accounts with very low interest rates, but you can use these accounts to start building up a small amount of money that you can use in the future.

If you’re looking for a safe investment, savings accounts are a great option. You can also use money market accounts to save your cash in a slightly riskier way. Money market accounts have slightly higher interest rates than savings accounts and can be a great way to start investing if you have a larger amount of money to spare.

## TIP: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

Although it can be tempting to put all of your money into one investment – especially if it’s doing really well – it’s not a good idea. If something goes wrong, you could lose everything and then you’ll have nothing left.
One good investment is better than several bad ones. Spread your investments out so that if one drops in value, you can still make some money with the others.

## Invest money you won’t need soon

Younger investors should be looking at long-term investments that they won’t need access to for 10 to 15 years or more. These will give you time to ride out any bumps in the road and come out on top.

So, while it might be tempting to invest in your best friend’s hot new app that promises to make you a fortune in a month, you might want to think again. Take the time to research the best investments for beginners and ones that have been proven to be successful over time so that you can make the most of your money.

## Borrowing to invest is risky and not recommended.

Borrowing money for investment is risky and not recommended for beginners. If the investment goes wrong, you now have money you need to pay back in addition to the loss from the investment itself.
Borrowing money to invest is dangerous because a sudden change in the market could leave you with nothing to pay back. Even if you use a less risky investment, there’s no guarantee that you’ll make enough money to pay back your loan.

## Invest in stocks and bonds

Stocks are another classic investment that lets you invest in the future of a company and make money off of its growth. Bonds are more of a sure thing, but don’t necessarily offer as much of a return on your investment as stocks do.
Investing in stocks is a great way to make more money, but it’s also a riskier investment. The market can be unpredictable and you could lose some or all of your money if the stock doesn’t perform as well as hoped.

When you first start investing, you might want to stick to bonds. They are a bit safer and more predictable. They also tend to offer higher interest rates than savings accounts. Once you get more comfortable with the investment world, you can start adding stocks to your portfolio.

## ETFs are a great investment for beginners

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that track the value of a group of stocks or a certain type of asset, such as gold. They’re very similar to mutual funds, but they have lower management fees and are easier to buy and sell. ETFs are a great investment for beginners because they give you diversification across many different types of investments.

Exchange-traded funds also have a very low minimum investment amount, so they are a great way to start investing if you only have a small amount of money to spare.
