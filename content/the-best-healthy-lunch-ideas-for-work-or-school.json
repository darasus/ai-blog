  "intro": "Did you know that those little brown bag lunches we made in elementary school are now a thing again? Super cool, right? Well, sort of. If you’re like most adults and teens, you probably don’t have time to pack your own lunch every day. Instead, many of us rely on fast food or convenience stores for our midday meal. While this can be an affordable and convenient option, these places often offer unhealthy food loaded with salt and fat. \nFortunately, there are more healthy options out there than you might think. These days there are many drive-through restaurants that serve much healthier versions of the standard fast food menu items. Cafeterias in offices, schools, libraries and other public places also tend to offer healthy choices as well as salad bars and other stations where you can make your own healthy salads or sandwiches.",
  "content": "## The best part? You can make a healthy lunch in only five minutes.\n\nWith a little practice, you can even master the art of making your own sandwich in only one minute! Your lunch doesn’t have to be boring either. There are lots of easy ways to make your food more exciting without adding too many calories or fat. By adding just a few simple ingredients and condiments, you can transform just about any sandwich or salad into something that is both delicious and nutritious.\n\nDon’t go hungry!    \n\nIf you’re hungry when you sit down to eat, you’re more likely to choose unhealthier foods. Avoid this temptation by eating something light, like a piece of fruit, before you start your lunch break. This will help you to avoid the mid-afternoon slump that often leads to poor food choices.\n\nWatch out for mayo and creamy dressings    \n\nMost creamy salad dressings and sandwiches are high in fat and calories. Instead, try using vinaigrette, a vinegar-based salad dressing, or just plain olive oil. Parmesan cheese, croutons and other crunchy toppings are a great way to add flavor without a lot of calories.\n\nGo for whole grains whenever possible    \n\nWhole grains, like whole wheat bread, are healthier than refined grains, like white bread. Try using whole wheat pita bread or even lettuce wraps instead of bread. You can often find low-sodium versions that are healthier than standard white bread.\n\nBrighten up your sandwich with crunchy toppings    \n\nVegetables like lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers are great for adding crunch to a sandwich. Sliced apples, raisins and even nuts are other tasty crunchy toppings. Avoid high-fat ingredients, like fried foods and cheese, that can make your lunch less healthy.\n\nAdd some greens to your meal    \n\nDark, leafy greens, like spinach or kale, are packed with nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Most restaurants will let you add a side salad to your meal. You can also buy bagged salad and other greens that don’t require much prep.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe best part? You can make a healthy lunch in only five minutes. With a little practice, you can even master the art of making your own sandwich in only one minute! Your lunch doesn’t have to be boring either. There are lots of easy ways to make your food more exciting without adding too many calories or fat.

By making simple changes, such as replacing white bread with whole wheat bread, choosing vegetables as a side dish and packing a salad instead of a sandwich, you can drastically reduce the amount of fat and calories in your midday meal. Creating a healthy lunch doesn’t have to be time consuming, but it does require a few small adjustments to your daily routine. With a little practice, you can create a nutritious and delicious meal in next to no time."
