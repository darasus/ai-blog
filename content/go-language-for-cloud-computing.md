## Language selection process

The first step when deciding which language to use is to understand what you’re trying to accomplish. What business problems do you want to solve with cloud applications? What are the requirements for your project? Which languages are best suited to solve your business problems?

Armed with this information, you can create a short list of languages that you’ll then need to consider in more detail. You’ll want to take into account the characteristics and qualities of each language, as well as the feasibility of learning it and hiring developers to create applications.

## What to look for in a cloud programming language

When evaluating languages for use in the cloud, there are several factors to consider. Each plays an important role in helping you decide on the best cloud language for your project.

- TCO: Total cost of ownership

This refers to the initial investment required to create the application as well as ongoing costs. These include the cost of development, training, maintenance, and support.
- Scalability and reliability

This refers to the ability of the language to handle sudden increases in demand for your application as well as issues with availability.
- Speed and performance

This refers to the speed at which your application runs. It also refers to the overall performance of the language.
- Conclusion

The choice of language for your cloud application must be carefully considered. While certain languages might be a better fit for certain types of applications, you should always choose the language that best solves your business problem.
