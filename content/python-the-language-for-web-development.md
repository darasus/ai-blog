## What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for almost any computing task. Its standard library includes a broad selection of modules that implement specialized tasks. It is open source, scalable and easy to learn.

There are several different types of software that can be written in Python including websites, data analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more. This makes Python an incredibly useful skill to have that can apply to many different industries.

## Why Learn Python for Web Development?

The demand for web developers is growing as more businesses invest in websites as media for promotion and revenue generation. According to estimates, the employment rate for this occupation will grow 9% by 2026. Meanwhile, the average salary for web developers is $96,000 annually. If you are interested in pursuing a web development career, the question is which programming language you should choose.

The following are advantages of learning Python for web development:

- Short learning curve - Python is an easy language to learn, especially if you are new to programming. This can save you time and money as you won’t have to spend as much time studying as you would with other languages.
- Easy to read - Python code is easy to read and understand. This makes it easier to collaborate with other developers on projects as well as review and edit your own code later on.
- Scales well for large projects - Python is a scalable language that can be used for both small and large-scale applications. This makes it ideal for building large and complex applications with many features.
- Open source - Python is an open source language that is free to use and distribute. This makes it an affordable skill to learn and allows you to create applications without having to pay for a license.

## How Is Python Used for Web Development?

Web development is a broad field that can include everything from designing websites to managing server architecture. Depending on the type of project, a developer may use different programming languages.

Most websites are built on a programming language called “server-side programming”, in which programs run on a server and send data to users. The most common languages for this are PHP and Python. Both are open source and free to use. They are also easy to learn and can be picked up by beginners very quickly. There are also paid online courses for both languages if you want to get a head start.

Here are some examples of how Python can be used for web development:

- Static websites - With Python, you can create static websites without needing to write a line of code. There are many different static website builders that allow you to create simple websites with drag and drop interfaces.
- Data APIs - Python can be used to develop data APIs that can be integrated with other web apps. Data APIs are websites that provide data to other applications. This can be any type of information an app needs to function, such as weather forecasts or stock market data.

## Pros of Python for web development

- Widely used - Python has been used in industry for more than two decades and is one of the most popular programming languages by developer surveys. This means there are plenty of online communities and tutorials for learning.
- Great for data visualization - Python has been used for data visualization since the beginning of its development. This makes it a good choice if you want to make visualizations as part of your project.
- Easy to use - Python is easy to learn and use, especially for beginners. This makes it an ideal language to start with if you have no coding experience.
- Free and open source - Python is a free and open source language that can be used without paying any royalties or fees. You can use it to create both open source and closed source projects.

## Cons of learning Python for web development

- Poor performance - Python has some issues with performance when working with large datasets. This can impact its functionality as a server-side language for websites.
- Poor structure for large projects - Python is a very fluid language that allows for quick changes and edits. However, this also means it lacks in structure and can be difficult to manage with large projects.

## Conclusion

If you’re interested in pursuing a web development career, Python is an excellent language to learn given its wide range of uses and ease of implementation. It is a great choice for beginners, given its easy syntax and open source accessibility. If you are curious about what the most popular programming language is, you’ve found your answer!

Now that you know what Python is and why it is a great language to learn, all that is left is to choose a learning resource and start building your skills.
