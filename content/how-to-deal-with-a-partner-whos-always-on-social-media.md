summary: Dating apps are designed to make us feel like our love lives are always
  just a couple of swipes away. With so many options, it can be hard to decide
  who to message next, or to figure out what’s appropriate to say. Your partner
  might not like being reminded that all of these other people are out there,
  waiting to meet them. Set aside time to be with each other, even if you’re
  living together. Don’t let your partner use dating apps as a way to treat
  others poorly.
intro: >-
  According to recent analysis by Statista, the average millennial spends
  almost one hour every day on social media. That’s not just posting pictures
  and updating our profiles, but also lurking on other people’s profiles. The
  rise of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Happn has only hastened this
  tendency. In fact, an article in Fast Company suggests that millennials are so
  preoccupied with online dating that they now spend more time on it than on any
  other leisure activity besides watching TV or listening to music. 

  On top of all this, many couples now meet their partners online – a third of marriages in the U.S. start with either partner meeting their future spouse through an online dating site or app. While it’s easy to feel pressured into signing up for these services if you don’t have friends who are single and looking for love, being in a relationship with someone who does use them regularly can be challenging at times.

## What’s so frustrating about dating apps?

Dating apps are designed to make us feel like our love lives are always just a couple of swipes away. They remind us that we could be meeting someone new at any moment, whenever we have a couple of minutes to spare. With so many options, it can be hard to decide who to message next, or to figure out what’s appropriate to say. Plus, the abundance of choices can be a source of anxiety. After all, how do you know which people you should spend your time pursuing, and which ones you should let go?

Of course, the problem is that you might want to spend some time browsing dating apps, but your partner might not like being reminded that all of these other people are out there, waiting to meet them.

## The problem with living together and using dating apps.

Even if your partner is single and looking for a relationship, they may have bad experiences on dating apps. Because it’s easy to be rude and inconsiderate when you’re behind a screen, many people use dating apps as a way to treat others poorly. It can be especially hard to deal with if your partner decides to start dating multiple people at once, and they use these apps to do so.

Even if your partner is respectful and honest when they’re using dating apps, there are still reasons why you might not enjoy hearing about their experiences. You probably don’t want to know about their dates, or hear about the people they meet. You might want to avoid dating apps for that reason alone.

## How to navigate these challenges (and feel better about it).

When you’re living with your partner, it’s important to remember that you two are in a relationship, too. You might be together all day, every day, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t also have some alone time. It’s important to set aside time to be with each other, even if you’re living together.

When you’re living with your partner, it’s easy to be constantly connected. You might be in the same room, but still feel like you’re never actually connecting. That might be because you’re both only focused on your screens, not each other. So set some time aside each day to be with each other. You’ll have time to talk later. It might be helpful to put your phones away during this time.

## Don’t Let It Become A Battle

If your partner is spending a lot of time on dating apps, it’s easy to get resentful. You might feel like they’re putting themselves first and living their lives for themselves. While it’s important to be able to spend some time focusing on yourself, there are ways to do that that don’t involve dating apps.

So, sit down together and talk about how each of you spend your time, and what you each want from it. Then, work out some ground rules. For example, you might decide that your partner can spend as much time on dating apps as they want as long as they don’t meet anyone in person until they’ve dated you for six months.

## Find The Bright Side Of Their Socially Mediated Life

You might not want your partner to spend all their time online, but they might have reasons for doing so. Maybe they have anxiety and dating apps give them the freedom to explore meeting new people in a low-pressure environment. Maybe they just really like talking to people online and prefer it to talking in person.

Instead of resenting their online habits, try to understand them and why they do what they do. This might be especially helpful if you’re living with your partner and want to avoid spending too much time on dating apps yourself.

## Take Care Of Yourself, Too!

It’s important to remember that dating apps are not the be all and end all of relationships. Yes, people can and do meet their life partners through dating apps. But they can also meet them at work, at school, through friends, etc. Your partner spending time on dating apps does not mean that you’re less likely to meet someone.

On the other hand, you still need to take care of yourself. This can be especially important if your partner is dating multiple people at once. It can be easy to feel like you’re being neglected or pushed aside. Make sure to have time for yourself, and to spend time with friends and family.
