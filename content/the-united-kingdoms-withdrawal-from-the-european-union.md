## Supply Chain Risk Management

The EU is the UK's main trading partner, accounting for 44% of goods exports in 2017. That could change if the UK is forced to negotiate new trade agreements with other countries. To avoid supply chain disruptions, businesses should review their supply chain management policies and procedures, as well as their contracts and terms of sale. They should also assess the risk of changes in the supply chain, including tariffs and changes in the way products are transported. Finally, they should monitor developments that could create disruptions, such as whether the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

When choosing suppliers and contractors, businesses should assess their ability to meet the contract's requirements and the risk of the supplier or contractor not being able to perform. They should also evaluate their ability to enforce the contract and obtain compensation if the supplier or contractor fails to perform.

## Business Continuity Strategies

While no one can predict what will happen as the UK leaves the EU, businesses can take steps now to prepare for uncertainty and mitigate risk. Companies can also take advantage of new opportunities that may be created by Brexit.

One of the best ways to prepare for Brexit is to identify your company’s critical functions. This will enable you to determine which functions are critical to your business (and therefore must be maintained in the event of disruption or disaster). You should also identify your critical assets (e.g., employees, suppliers, and distributors) and critical relationships (e.g., with customers, regulators, or other stakeholders).

To develop a business continuity plan for Brexit, you should assess the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit and other Brexit scenarios. You should also monitor developments related to Brexit that could impact critical functions, critical assets, and critical relationships. Finally, you should periodically test your business continuity plan to determine whether the plan is adequate.

## Employee Retention Strategies

Brexit has created anxiety among UK and EU employees. Some employees may worry that their jobs will be eliminated or that they will be unable to obtain the necessary work permits because of skill, nationality, or educational deficiencies.

Managing employee anxiety is a challenge for many employers as they attempt to navigate these uncertainties. To prepare for Brexit, employers should identify employees who are most affected by Brexit and what they need to be more productive, such as clarity about the company's post-Brexit strategy or reassurance that their jobs are safe.

Employers can also take steps to retain EU workers who may be considering leaving the UK or the EU. For example, employers can offer opportunities for career development and provide clarity about their post-Brexit strategy. To retain key employees, employers can also consider offering a higher salary or benefits.

## Productivity Improvement Strategies

To take advantage of opportunities created by Brexit, businesses can identify new markets for their products or services. They can also explore ways to improve the productivity or efficiency of their operations.

For example, businesses can assess their products or services for opportunities to reposition them for new markets or improve their functionality. They can also assess their operations for opportunities to enhance their productivity or efficiency.

Some businesses may want to take the opportunity of Brexit to rebrand their products or services. In some cases, it may make more sense to reposition the company rather than reposition the product or service. Doing so could give the company a more competitive advantage in new markets.

## Legal Responses to Brexit

Businesses have been responding to Brexit by reviewing their contracts and terms of sale to ensure that they adequately address legal issues that may arise once the UK is outside the EU.

Businesses may want to consider whether to include a provision in their contracts that allows them to terminate the contract or amend the contract if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. They may also want to include an indemnity provision in their contracts to reduce the risk of any claims that the other party to the contract might otherwise have against them.

Some businesses may also want to review their contracts with EU customers to determine what changes are needed to account for the UK’s departure from the EU. Businesses may want to consider whether to ask their EU customers to provide a letter of credit or make other arrangements to protect themselves against the risk that the EU customers will default on their contracts.

## Marketing Strategy Adjustments

Companies can adapt their marketing strategies to take advantage of new opportunities that Brexit has created.

For example, companies may want to consider expanding their marketing channels to reach new customers in the EU or new markets outside the EU. They may also want to reevaluate their marketing strategies to determine whether their products or services are positioned appropriately to take advantage of Brexit.

Businesses may want to review their marketing strategies or campaign materials to determine whether they are still relevant. They may also want to reevaluate their marketing budgets and strategies to determine whether they are sufficient to take advantage of new opportunities created by Brexit.

## Bottom Line

In addition to the challenges Brexit creates, it also creates opportunities for businesses. The industry-specific challenges and potential opportunities regarding Brexit are different for every company. Some businesses may need to make changes to their products, services or supply chain; others may need to make strategic hires; while still others must manage employee anxiety about job security.

The key is to be prepared for Brexit before it happens so that businesses can take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
