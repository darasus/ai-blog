The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, also known as Brexit, was a historic event that took place on June 23, 2016. The people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, and the country is now in the process of negotiating its withdrawal.

The European Union is a political and economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The UK was one of the first countries to join the EU, and it has been a member since 1973. The decision to leave the EU was a controversial one, and the vote was very close. In the end, 52% of voters chose to leave, and 48% voted to remain.

The UK's withdrawal from the EU will have far-reaching consequences. The most immediate impact will be felt on the UK's economy. The country is already facing uncertainty and instability in the wake of the Brexit vote, and leaving the EU will only add to this. In the long term, Brexit will also have an impact on the UK's relationships with other countries, as well as its role in the world.
