There\\u2019s a catch here, though: BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day.

For example, let\\u2019t say you eat a medium sized baked potato (300 calories) with a large piece of salmon (100 calories). You have just consumed 400 calories, and your body will have to spend about 100 calories to digest them, leaving you with a net total of 300 calories.

That means the more you exercise, the more calories you burn every day. Almost every part of your body is involved in the process of metabolism, which means you can affect it in many ways. For example, muscle mass burns calories even when you\\u2019re not exercising, so the more muscle you have on your frame, the more calories you burn every day.

Your metabolic rate is affected by your body type, and it\\u2019s something that can\\u2019t really be changed through diet or exercise.
