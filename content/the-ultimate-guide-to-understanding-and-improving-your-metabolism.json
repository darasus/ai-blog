  "summary": "Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories and converts them into energy. Itâ€™s the minimum amount of calories your body needs to function properly and stay alive. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) accounts for only a fraction of the calories you burn in a day. The rest is accounted for by the thermic effect of food (TEF) and activity level.

It\\u2019s the minimum amount of calories your body needs to function properly and stay alive. BMR can be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, which estimates your daily caloric needs based on your sex, age, and weight. There\\u2019s a catch here, though: BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day. The rest is accounted for by the thermic effect of food (TEF), which is the amount of calories that are burned to digest food, and activity level, which is the amount of calories burned due to daily activities.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day, then TEF accounts for the rest. TEF is the number of calories that are burned to digest food, which means the more you eat, the more calories you spend digesting it. For example, let\\u2019t say you eat a medium sized baked potato (300 calories) with a large piece of salmon (100 calories). You have just consumed 400 calories, and your body will have to spend about 100 calories to digest them, leaving you with a net total of 300 calories. That means that if you\\u2019re eating the recommended 2,000 calories per day, you\\u2019re spending the same amount of calories on digestion that you\\u2019re consuming through food, leaving you with a daily calorie deficit \\u2013 which is the key to weight loss.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Activity Level\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"We all know how important exercise is for weight loss, but what most people don\\u2019t know is that it also helps boost metabolism. That means the more you exercise, the more calories you burn every day. Almost every part of your body is involved in the process of metabolism, which means you can affect it in many ways. For example, muscle mass burns calories even when you\\u2019re not exercising, so the more muscle you have on your frame, the more calories you burn every day. On the other hand, your metabolic rate goes down when you\\u2019re under stress, so the more you can manage your stress levels, the better your metabolism will be.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Body Type\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Your body type is determined by your genes and how your body responds to the environment you\\u2019re in. For example, if you\\u2019re an ectomorph, you\\u2019re naturally thin and lean and have a fast metabolism, whereas if you\\u2019re an endomorph, you\\u2019re naturally heavier in build with a slower metabolism. Your metabolic rate is affected by your body type, and it\\u2019s something that can\\u2019t really be changed through diet or exercise. For example, if you have a very fast metabolism, you can eat all the healthiest foods in the world and exercise as much as you want, but you\\u2019ll probably never gain weight. On the other hand, if you have a very slow metabolism, you can eat nothing but broccoli, and you\\u2019ll probably never lose weight.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Gender\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Men and women metabolisms are very different, and the main reason behind this is hormones. Women\\u2019s bodies burn more calories than men\\u2019s due to their higher hormone levels, which is why men are more likely to gain weight than women, even when they eat and exercise the same amount. That said, the differences between genders are very subtle and not as drastic as you may have thought. For example, in a man who weighs 80kg and a woman who weighs 60kg, the woman will burn about 50 more calories per day than the man. That said, the difference between men and women is enough to cause some variation in weight loss and dietary needs.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories and converts them into energy.
