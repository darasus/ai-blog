It\\u2019s the minimum amount of calories your body needs to function properly and stay alive. BMR can be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, which estimates your daily caloric needs based on your sex, age, and weight. There\\u2019s a catch here, though: BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day. The rest is accounted for by the thermic effect of food (TEF), which is the amount of calories that are burned to digest food, and activity level, which is the amount of calories burned due to daily activities.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day, then TEF accounts for the rest. TEF is the number of calories that are burned to digest food, which means the more you eat, the more calories you spend digesting it. For example, let\\u2019t say you eat a medium sized baked potato (300 calories) with a large piece of salmon (100 calories). You have just consumed 400 calories, and your body will have to spend about 100 calories to digest them, leaving you with a net total of 300 calories. That means that if you\\u2019re eating the recommended 2,000 calories per day, you\\u2019re spending the same amount of calories on digestion that you\\u2019re consuming through food, leaving you with a daily calorie deficit \\u2013 which is the key to weight loss.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Activity Level\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"We all know how important exercise is for weight loss, but what most people don\\u2019t know is that it also helps boost metabolism. That means the more you exercise, the more calories you burn every day. Almost every part of your body is involved in the process of metabolism, which means you can affect it in many ways. For example, muscle mass burns calories even when you\\u2019re not exercising, so the more muscle you have on your frame, the more calories you burn every day.

Your metabolic rate is affected by your body type, and it\\u2019s something that can\\u2019t really be changed through diet or exercise. For example, if you have a very fast metabolism, you can eat all the healthiest foods in the world and exercise as much as you want, but you\\u2019ll probably never gain weight.

That said, the differences between genders are very subtle and not as drastic as you may have thought.
