intro: >-
  The Hateful Eight is a magnificent movie. It is also a somewhat odd one,
  in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect
  from Quentin Tarantino. 

  A critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light. 

  Since then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting – post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that’s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we’re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.

## A movie about talking

The Hateful Eight is an almost entirely talky film. There are only a handful of scenes with any action in them, three of which are mostly significant for the context of one of the film’s themes, a fourth of which is a brief but memorable stage show, and a fifth of which is a quick action sequence towards the end of the film.
Most of the rest of the film is a series of conversations, as a group of strangers find themselves trapped in a small cabin, waiting out a blizzard (and not knowing if a second group of strangers are also in the cabin with them).

At a first pass, it sounds like a recipe for a snooze – a long series of people sitting around a table, talking. 
The nature of those conversations, though, and the way they are structured, make The Hateful Eight, despite its static setting, an incredibly compelling movie to watch.

## An ensemble movie about ensembles (and straying from ensemble norms)

The Hateful Eight is an ensemble film, a film with a large number of characters and subplots, all of which are important to the overall story.
But The Hateful Eight also features some characters who are not central to the plot – they have subplots and character arcs, but they don’t actually propel the main story forwards.
This is quite unusual for an ensemble film, which typically has its characters fall into two categories – main characters who drive the plot, and supporting characters who are there to help the main characters.

## A movie about race and a movie with racial problems

One of the most interesting things about The Hateful Eight is that you can almost see the filmmakers sitting down and saying, “We want to make a movie about race, but we want to get it right. And to do that, we need to look at how other people have done it in the past and try to avoid the same mistakes they did.”
In many ways, The Hateful Eight is a reaction to the past, a deliberate attempt to avoid the mistakes that have been made in the past with regards to race.
At the same time, though, when you look at it through a modern lens, it is also a very problematic film – a movie that is trying very hard to do the right thing, but which nonetheless falls into some of the same traps that other movies do.

## But also a movie in which nobody is racist

The Hateful Eight is a movie in which the main characters are almost all white and the main characters who are non-white are mostly villains. (There are two characters who could be described as Asian, but one of them is a woman who is almost certainly Chinese, not Japanese. The other is a man who is given no cultural identity.)
The other characters who are non-white in the movie are a Mexican man who is a bounty hunter (and who is treated poorly by the other characters), a black man who is a bounty hunter and a Native American man whose loyalties are suspect and who might be an informant (a “two-eyed” man).
Despite the fact that the film is about race and racism, almost nobody in the film is actually racist. Everyone treats the black bounty hunter badly, but that is because he is black, not because he is a bounty hunter (and bounty hunters are despised in this film).

## A movie about gender, but with problematic women characters

The Hateful Eight is, in some ways, a very feminist film – a movie that shows a story from the point of view of a woman and a movie that is critical of men who treat women badly.
The main story, though, is about two men – a bounty hunter who must find and kill another man, a man who must survive and find a way to save his dead friend’s family.
The subplots all revolve around women, but they are problematic women characters – women who are not portrayed as strong or empowered, but who instead have an almost Victorian quality to them.

## A conclusion: The Hateful Eight as a deliberate statement?

The Hateful Eight is a movie about race, about what it is like to be non-white in a white-dominated society, and about the difficulties of finding a way to transcend those barriers and live together peacefully.
It is also a movie about gender, about how men and women are treated differently (and perhaps unfairly) and about how men and women can find a way to live together as equals and respect each other.
Perhaps most importantly, The Hateful Eight is a movie about how difficult it is to overcome the divisions that exist between people.

It is a movie about how hard it can be to truly understand each other and to walk in each other’s shoes. It is a movie about how hard it can be to sit down and have a conversation. And it is a movie that has a very long, very difficult conversation that is worth listening to.
