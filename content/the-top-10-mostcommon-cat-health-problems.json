FIV cannot be cured, but it can be managed with medication and a healthy lifestyle. It is a relatively common cat health problem, especially in shelters.\nIf you have adopted a new cat from a shelter, be sure to have it tested for FIV. This will help you to plan the best course of treatment for your feline friend.\n\n## Flea-Borne Illnesses in Cats\n\nCats are not the definitive host for fleas, but they are carriers of certain diseases that are transmitted by the fleas.\nUnfortunately, there are very few flea-control options available for cats. That being said, there are some steps you can take to protect your cat from flea-borne illnesses:\n\n- Keep your home clean and vacuum frequently.\n- Use insecticides to kill fleas in your home.\n- Use flea collars to protect your cat from fleas outside.\n\nAll of these steps will protect your cat from some of the diseases that are transmitted by fleas, like tapeworms. However, it’s important to remember that there is no 100% effective way to protect your cat from fleas.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCats are beautiful, independent creatures that deserve the best in life. To keep them healthy, you must recognize the signs of common cat health problems and take your cat to the vet as soon as possible.\nWhen your vet examines your cat, they will be able to determine what the issue is and provide the best possible care.
