Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed. If you\\u2019re considering implementing mediation in your organization, here are some helpful tips on how to effectively mediate an employee dispute:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Putting your dog in a boarding facility or kennel isn\\u2019t an easy decision for most pet owners, especially if you have a sensitive breed (i.e., lots of barking = unhappy dogs). So how can you get your pup ready to be on their own? It\\u2019s not as simple as locking them in a closet for a few hours once or twice and then expecting them to be cool with it. Dogs don\\u2019t think like people; they don\\u2019t understand symbolic actions like turning off the light as meaning that you won\\u2019t be coming back home tonight.
