A plant-based diet has many benefits. It can help you lose weight, lower your cholesterol, and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. It can also help you reduce your risk of cancer.

A plant-based diet is also good for the environment. It takes less water and land to grow plants than it does to raise animals. And plants don’t produce the greenhouse gases that animals do.

If you’re thinking about switching to a plant-based diet, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian. They can help you make sure you’re getting all the nutrients you need.
