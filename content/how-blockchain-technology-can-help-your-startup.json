Because of this structure, anyone can see and access that data. Even with permissioned blockchains, you'll lose confidentiality of data because all participants can see the data. If you use the public blockchain, your business will pay for every transaction that occurs on the network. Hybrid blockchains allow you to update the software as needed without affecting the data that is stored on the blockchain.",
