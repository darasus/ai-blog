Each block in the chain is like a page in a ledger, which is updated and linked to the previous page in the ledger.

This is particularly helpful for businesses that operate in the food and beverage industry. It can help them track the journey of each ingredient from the farm to the final product. Similarly, it can be used to track the journey of each product from the place of manufacture to the final destination.\nHosting User Data on Blockchain: Blockchain technology can be used to store sensitive user data like identification information, medical history, financial records, and academic achievements. This is particularly useful for businesses that operate in the healthcare sector. These businesses can use blockchain technology to store user data in a secure, immutable database. Similarly, it can be used to ensure secure online voting for elections.\nInvesting in Blockchain Startups: If your startup wants to go beyond just incorporating blockchain into your business and also wants to use it as a mechanism to accept payments, then you need to buy tokens in blockchain startups that offer an ICO.

This solution records each step of the supply chain process, including harvesting, packaging, transportation, and more, and creates a tamper-proof, digital record of each event.
