In fact, the demand for such applications is growing all the time\\u2014and Java developers who can build them are in high demand.\nWorking with a programming language like Java, which has been around for so long and proven its staying power time and again, is as much of an opportunity as it is a challenge. Because every other programmer out there has also discovered the same thing about Java \\u2013 that it\\u2019s both stable and powerful.\nThat doesn\\u2019t mean there aren\\u2019t plenty of frameworks and libraries to choose from \\u2013 there are more than enough options from which to choose! These libraries and frameworks make it easier to build websites using Java without having to worry about boilerplate code or syntax details.

Part of that popularity is based on its history: it\\u2019s been around for a long time and has a great history behind it.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But it\\u2019s also a great framework for building modern websites and applications, with all the latest and greatest frameworks and libraries built in. Spring JMS, Spring Security, and Spring Data are all part of the Spring family and can be used together, or independently, in any application.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"From the start, the Spring Framework designed itself to be modular and extensible. That means that you can start out with just the pieces that you need, and add new modules as your application grows and requires more functionality. And when you do add something new, you can be sure that it will work with the rest of your application.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Java is an incredibly versatile programming language, and one of the reasons for its success is its ability to be used in many different environments and contexts. The same Java code can be used to build desktop applications (like Windows or Mac applications), mobile apps, web applications, and much more. Java is also open source, which means that anyone can use it for free.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Java is used to build the front end of many web applications, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) is one of the languages used to build web apps. JSP is a server-side language that allows you to create static HTML pages that are stored in a server database and are sent to the browser as plain text.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Struts 2 Framework\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The open source Struts framework is designed to make developing web apps easier by providing a structured way to organize your code and make it reusable. Struts is an excellent Java web development framework for building robust web applications and is one of the first tools new developers are introduced to when learning Java.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As with most Java frameworks, it makes use of as much open source software as possible, including Apache Commons and Apache Jakarta libraries. It also has a large online community that benefits from the collaborative nature of open source work.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the best things about Struts is the fact that it\\u2019s categorized as a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. MVC frameworks allow you to separate the different parts of your app into different sections. In this case, the model is the database, the view is the web page, and the controller is the code that manages the communication between the two.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Grails With Groovy\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Grails is another Java web development framework that has been around since 2005 and is written in the Groovy language. It was designed to be an easy way to create data-driven websites and apps, and it takes full advantage of the Java platform.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Grails was created with the intention of making it easier for developers to work with Java. It uses convention over configuration, which means that the framework uses rules and assumptions to make decisions for you, such as naming conventions, environment settings, etc. This makes configuration easy and less time-consuming.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Grails is a powerful framework that makes it easy to build web applications and websites using Java. It supports many different databases, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server. It also comes with a number of built-in features that make it easy to create, maintain, and add new content to your website.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The Java programming language has been around for a long time, but it\\u2019s still one of the most popular languages used today.
