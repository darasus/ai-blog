The demand for coders is growing, and not just in tech companies. Companies of all types need programmers with different coding skills to build their software and websites, which means that coders can find jobs anywhere.\nCoding is also one of the fastest-growing job markets at the moment. As businesses continue to digitize and automate processes, the need for developers who can create programs increases as well. The explosion of new programming languages has made this an exciting time to be a coder. There are so many options out there \\u2013 from traditional ones like Java and Python to newer players like Go and Kotlin. Which do you think makes for a more promising career as a coder?

There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

They both support curly bracket syntax with optional semicolons, as well > operators for type checking, and if-else conditional statements. Both support variables, data types (string, boolean, number), and function calls with optional arguments and return values.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
