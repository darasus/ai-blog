## What is a Pie?

A pie is a baked dish made with a pastry crust that is filled with a sweet or savory filling. The term “pie” is believed to have first appeared in the 13th century, although the exact etymology of the word remains unclear. The earliest pie recipes were often sweetened starchy fillings such as peas, apples, and pears that were baked inside a pastry crust.

The crust on a pie acts as a barrier between the filling and the baking dish, preventing the juices in the filling from seeping into the dish and burning. The type of crust you use for your pie can also add a delicious texture and flavour to the overall dish.

## Types of Pies

Apple - Apple pies are a classic autumn dessert that can be served at any occasion. Apples, cinnamon, and sugar are baked inside a flaky pastry crust to create a sweet and hearty treat.

Banana - Banana cream pies are a classic American dessert. A banana cream pie is made with a crumbly pastry crust, a creamy banana filling, and a generous layer of whipped cream on top.

Custard - Custard pies are a classic British dessert that can be made with a variety of different fillings. Common custard pie fillings include lemon, blackberry, and raspberry.

Egg - An egg custard pie is an American baked dessert that is made with a flaky pastry crust, a creamy filling made with eggs, milk, and sugar, and a light dusting of nutmeg on top.

## The Secret to a Good Pie Crust

While the perfect pie crust is delicious in its own right, its primary function is to hold the filling in the crust and prevent it from burning. From a flavor perspective, the ingredients in the crust are usually subtle enough to allow the filling to stand out. That being said, there are a few tips and tricks to making the perfect pie crust every time.

- Use plenty of butter or shortening - The fat in the butter or shortening helps the crust hold together and taste delicious.
- Use a flaky pastry flour - This contains a higher proportion of bran which creates the flaky texture you want in a pie crust.
- Use ice water to bring the pastry together - Adding ice water to the pastry will help bring the crust together without making it tough.
- Use a pastry blender or your hands to cut in the fat - This creates an even texture in the crust that will be flaky and delicious.
- Roll the dough out from the centre - This will help the crust spread evenly in the baking dish.
- Don’t overbake the crust - The crust should be a light golden brown, not dark brown or burnt.
- Let the baked crust cool before filling - Filled crusts that are too warm will be gooey and messy.

## Key Ingredients for a Great Crust

While there are some tricks to the best pie crust, the actual ingredients are pretty basic. Here are the ingredients you need to make a great pie crust every time.
- Flour: Flour provides the base of your crust, so you want to make sure to use a high-quality brand. Whole wheat pastry flour is a good choice if you want a heartier crust, while all-purpose flour is perfect for a classic crust.
- Fat: Fat is what makes a pie crust flaky and delicious. You can choose between butter and shortening, though shortening is cheaper and works just as well.
- Salt: Salt brings out the flavour in the other ingredients, making them taste even better.
- Water: You can use ice water or hot water to bring the dough together.
- Sugar: Some people like to use granulated sugar for the crust, but it can make it a bit tough.
- Vinegar: You can add a splash of vinegar to the dough to help it bind together. This is especially helpful if you are using whole wheat flour.

## How to Make the Perfect Pie Crust by Hand

- Sprinkle the vinegar over the dough and knead it in until it forms a soft, smooth ball.

- Roll the dough out to fit the baking dish.
- Place the crust in the pie dish and fill with the filling.
- Bake the pie at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

## How to Make a Perfect Pie Crust with a Food Processor

Any kitchen can benefit from the fast and efficient work of a food processor. Here are the steps to follow.
- Pulse the flour, salt, and sugar in the food processor until combined.
