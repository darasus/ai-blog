Firstly, mediation is a voluntary process. This means that both sides have to agree to take part in mediation before the process begins. This helps ensure that everyone involved has a genuine interest in resolving their issues. In addition, mediation is a collaborative process. During mediation, both parties actively work together to resolve their issues and arrive at an agreement they can both adhere to.\nWhere mediation really shines, however, is in the way it helps both sides understand each other\\u2019s perspectives on the conflict. Mediators will often ask each side to explain their position on the conflict and why they feel the way they do about it. This process helps each party understand the other\\u2019s perspective on the conflict and puts them in a better position to find a solution that works for both of them.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How mediation helps resolve conflicts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`There are several ways that mediation helps resolve conflicts. Firstly, mediation helps people communicate with each other and find mutual understanding. This is incredibly helpful for resolving conflicts because it puts both sides in a position where they understand each other\\u2019s perspectives and can work together to find a mutually agreeable solution to their issues.\nSecondly, mediation helps people separate the conflict from their relationship. It\\u2019s not uncommon for people to become so entrenched in a conflict that they end up ruining their relationship in the process. Mediation helps avoid this by ensuring both sides understand each other and have the opportunity to come up with a solution that works for both of them.\nThirdly, mediation allows people to move past their conflict and move on with their lives. This is particularly important in situations where both sides have legitimate grievances that need to be addressed. In these situations, mediation provides a process for addressing these grievances and coming up with a solution that works for both sides.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mediation also helps you understand the root of conflict\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In addition to helping you resolve your current conflict, mediation also helps you understand the root of the conflict.

In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person\\u2019s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.\nAdditionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial. If you\\u2019re interested in learning more about this resolution process as a way to manage your own conflict or as an advisor if you are working with someone who needs help resolving their dispute, read on.
