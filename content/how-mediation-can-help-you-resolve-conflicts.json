It involves bringing neutral third-party mediators into the conflict and having them help both sides understand and work through their issues so they can resolve the problems on their own from there moving forward.

Firstly, mediation is a voluntary process. This means that both sides have to agree to take part in mediation before the process begins. This helps ensure that everyone involved has a genuine interest in resolving their issues. In addition, mediation is a collaborative process. During mediation, both parties actively work together to resolve their issues and arrive at an agreement they can both adhere to.\nWhere mediation really shines, however, is in the way it helps both sides understand each other\\u2019s perspectives on the conflict. Mediators will often ask each side to explain their position on the conflict and why they feel the way they do about it. This process helps each party understand the other\\u2019s perspective on the conflict and puts them in a better position to find a solution that works for both of them.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How mediation helps resolve conflicts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`There are several ways that mediation helps resolve conflicts. Firstly, mediation helps people communicate with each other and find mutual understanding.

It\\u2019s not uncommon for people to become so entrenched in a conflict that they end up ruining their relationship in the process. Mediation helps avoid this by ensuring both sides understand each other and have the opportunity to come up with a solution that works for both of them.\nThirdly, mediation allows people to move past their conflict and move on with their lives.
