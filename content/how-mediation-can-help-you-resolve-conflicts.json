It involves bringing neutral third-party mediators into the conflict and having them help both sides understand and work through their issues so they can resolve the problems on their own from there moving forward.

Firstly, mediation is a voluntary process. This means that both sides have to agree to take part in mediation before the process begins. This helps ensure that everyone involved has a genuine interest in resolving their issues. In addition, mediation is a collaborative process. During mediation, both parties actively work together to resolve their issues and arrive at an agreement they can both adhere to.\nWhere mediation really shines, however, is in the way it helps both sides understand each other\\u2019s perspectives on the conflict. Mediators will often ask each side to explain their position on the conflict and why they feel the way they do about it. This process helps each party understand the other\\u2019s perspective on the conflict and puts them in a better position to find a solution that works for both of them.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How mediation helps resolve conflicts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`There are several ways that mediation helps resolve conflicts. Firstly, mediation helps people communicate with each other and find mutual understanding. This is incredibly helpful for resolving conflicts because it puts both sides in a position where they understand each other\\u2019s perspectives and can work together to find a mutually agreeable solution to their issues.\nSecondly, mediation helps people separate the conflict from their relationship. It\\u2019s not uncommon for people to become so entrenched in a conflict that they end up ruining their relationship in the process. Mediation helps avoid this by ensuring both sides understand each other and have the opportunity to come up with a solution that works for both of them.\nThirdly, mediation allows people to move past their conflict and move on with their lives. This is particularly important in situations where both sides have legitimate grievances that need to be addressed. In these situations, mediation provides a process for addressing these grievances and coming up with a solution that works for both sides.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mediation also helps you understand the root of conflict\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In addition to helping you resolve your current conflict, mediation also helps you understand the root of the conflict. Understanding the root of a conflict is incredibly important because it allows you to avoid similar conflicts in the future. This is because once you understand the root of a conflict, you\\u2019re in a much better position to avoid the same issues happening again in the future.\nMediation is a collaborative process that encourages both sides to actively participate in the discussion and try to come up with a solution that works for everyone involved.

There\\u2019s shopping, traveling and entertaining to consider. And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response. So if you want to reduce the stress of this festive time of year, here are five ways you can do so:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven\\u2019t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
