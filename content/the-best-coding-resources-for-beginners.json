Why? Because it offers a lot of benefits over other JSON APIs. Developers no longer need to hardcode endpoints or query data directly from an API; GraphQL abstracts that logic away, letting developers focus on their code instead of the data access layer.\nLet\\u2019s see what makes GraphQL so useful in the world of mobile apps.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Do you want to expose your child to STEM-related fields without sacrificing their creativity and imagination? If so, coding might be the perfect opportunity for both of you.\nCoding is an excellent skill to introduce your child to at an early age. It challenges them creatively and forces them to think critically. Additionally, it opens up a multitude of potential career opportunities in some of the fastest-growing fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.\nCoding falls within the scope of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) because it involves working with codes or sets of instructions that computers can read and understand.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to learn more about how coding can help your kid grow as a person and as a future adult\\u2014as well as why it\\u2019s important for kids\\u2014read on!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
