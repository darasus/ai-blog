Do you want to expose your child to STEM-related fields without sacrificing their creativity and imagination? If so, coding might be the perfect opportunity for both of you.\nCoding is an excellent skill to introduce your child to at an early age. It challenges them creatively and forces them to think critically. Additionally, it opens up a multitude of potential career opportunities in some of the fastest-growing fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.\nCoding falls within the scope of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) because it involves working with codes or sets of instructions that computers can read and understand.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to learn more about how coding can help your kid grow as a person and as a future adult\\u2014as well as why it\\u2019s important for kids\\u2014read on!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways. Object-oriented programming is a way of writing programs that aims to reduce redundancy and increase modularity by using objects that have their own data fields and methods that act on those fields instead of global variables.
