summary: Python is a general-purpose programming language with a simple syntax
  and powerful standard library. It is a great choice for beginner programmers
  due to its relative ease of use compared to other languages such as Java,
  C/C++, or C#. Python can be used for almost any programming task, from web
  development to data science. The language was developed in the late 1980s by a
  group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was
  conceived as a “better C” - a language that could be used by non-programmers.
intro: >-
  Python is an immensely powerful programming language that offers a
  variety of uses. It can be used for almost any task, from small one-off
  projects to large frameworks for server-side development, web applications,
  and even mobile apps. One area in which Python excels is database programming.
  In this article, we explain why that’s the case and explore the different ways
  in which you can use Python for database programming. 

  This blog post is part of our ongoing “Coding in CV” series. These shorter articles cover individual technical skills you may want to include in your resume or CV as a programmer or software developer - or indeed as anything with a computer in it! We look at everything from Java to cryptography and beyond.

## What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language with a simple syntax and powerful standard library. It is a great choice for beginner programmers due to its relative ease of use compared to other languages such as Java, C/C++, or C#. With this simplicity comes power, and Python can be used for almost any programming task, from web development to data science.

The language was developed in the late 1980s by a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was conceived as a “better C” - a language that could be used by non-programmers, while retaining the performance and power of lower-level languages.

Python’s syntax is minimal, with very little punctuation. For example, the “{}” and “()” that usually surround code in other languages are replaced by “:” in Python.

Due to its easy-to-use syntax, Python has become a popular language for beginners. It is one of the most popular introductory programming languages, along with Java and C++, and is commonly taught in schools and universities.

## Why use Python for database programming?

As the title suggests, one of the main reasons you should use Python for database programming is that it’s really easy to do! The syntax is simple, so it’s easy to understand what you are writing and it’s easy to read what other people have written. This means it’s quick to write and easy to maintain code. 

Another reason for choosing Python for database programming is its flexibility. The standard libraries are huge, allowing programmers to do all sorts of things with their code. There are modules for parsing and manipulating data, for working with networks, for storing data in various formats, for accessing databases, and more.

Python is also great for data scientists. It is used by many organizations for machine learning, statistics, and data analysis.

## Using Python to access databases

If you have decided to use Python for database programming, you first need to decide what type of database you want to use. There are many different relational databases on the market, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Python has libraries for a number of the most popular relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft’s SQL Server. Using these libraries, you can write Python code that connects to the database and manipulates its data. 

If you are using Python to access MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, you can write Python code to write data to the database. Many databases also allow you to read data from the database and write it to another format.

## Using Python to manipulate data in databases

If you decide to use Python for database programming, you can also use it to manipulate data in databases. For example, you can use the “select” and “where” statements that are part of any relational database to read data from tables, and then use the “for” loop to iterate through that data and manipulate it. 

Another way to manipulate data in databases is to write Python code that runs as a function. You can then write this function to run on a regular schedule, or when certain events occur. This can be very useful in situations where a database store huge amounts of data, but you only want to get a small subset of that data at any given time.

## Using Python to build database applications

If you decide to use Python for database programming, you can use it to build database applications. A database application is a complete program that manages one or more databases. They are very useful in situations where you need to regularly access or update data, or when you want to automate tasks.

Database applications are created in Python by writing code that accesses the database and calls functions written in other programming languages, such as C/C++, Java, or Rust. Python has libraries for a number of database management systems (DBMS), including Oracle and PostgreSQL.

To create database applications, you need to choose the language for the functions in which you want to write. You then write Python code that calls these functions.

## Summary

Python is a programming language that can be used for almost any task, including database programming. It is powerful and flexible, and has a simple syntax that is easy to understand and read. Python has libraries for a number of database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It can be used to read and manipulate data, and build database applications.
