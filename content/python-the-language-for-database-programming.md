Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language, created on December 3, 1989, by Guido van Rossum, with a design philosophy entitled, "There's only one way to do it, and that's why it works."

In the Python language, that means explicit is better than implicit. It also gives rise to the infamous Python telegraph pole analogy attributed to creator Guido van Rossum, which goes like this:

There is beauty in Ï€, elegance in an all-numeric telephone keypad . . . I am attracted to the simpleness of a perfect poker face, and the serenity of perfect punctuation mark placement. Just as art to be appreciated, comments to be enjoyed, and data to be played with, I enjoy reading Python philosophy.
