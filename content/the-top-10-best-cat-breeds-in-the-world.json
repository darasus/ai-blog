In this blog, we will explore what mediation is and why it works. If you are currently embroiled in a conflict or anticipate that one may arise, you may find the ideas in this blog article helpful.\nMediation is an excellent technique for ending disputes between friends, colleagues, family members or any party involved in a conflict. It involves bringing neutral third-party mediators into the conflict and having them help both sides understand and work through their issues so they can resolve the problems on their own from there moving forward.\nKeep reading to learn more about mediation and why it works so well for resolving conflicts.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
