It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.

It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
