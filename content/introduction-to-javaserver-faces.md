summary: JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a component-based UI framework for
  server-side applications written in Java. It is based on standard Java APIs
  and architecture that enables developers to build web applications more easily
  and efficiently. JSF is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
  architectural pattern. It can also be used for building enterprise
  applications that are deployed in large-scale systems. It was created as an
  alternative to Microsoft’s ASP.NET to reduce dependency on Microsoft products
  and increase interoperability.

## What is JavaServer Faces?

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a component-based UI framework for server-side applications written in Java. It is based on standard Java APIs and architecture that enables developers to build web applications more easily and efficiently.
JSF is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. You write your user interface by combining UI components, mapping these components to the model data, and then defining the interactions between the UI components and the model data.
JSF is predominantly used for building web applications that require heavy use of server-side services and dynamic user interface elements. It can also be used for building enterprise applications that are deployed in large-scale systems.

## Why use JavaServer Faces?

JAVA is one of the most popular programming languages used to create software and websites. One of the reasons why it has become so popular is that it has evolved over the years. One of the most significant evolutions of the language is the introduction of the JAVA Server Faces (JSF) technology.
JAVA Server Faces (JSF) is a server-side UI technology that leverages Java’s flexibility and built-in features to provide powerful and richly featured user interfaces for applications.
JAVA Server Faces (JSF) was added to the JAVA language in 2002. It was created as an alternative to Microsoft’s server-side UI technology – ASP.NET. This was done to reduce dependency on Microsoft products and increase interoperability.

## Introduction to key concepts in JavaServer Faces

There are some key concepts in JSF worth understanding before going any further.
This section will provide an overview of these concepts and how they interact with each other.

## JSF Architecture

JSF is a component-based user interface (UI) framework that is built on standard Java APIs and architecture. It enables developers to build web applications easily and efficiently.
JSF is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. You write your user interface by combining UI components, mapping these components to the model data, and then defining the interactions between the UI components and the model data.

## Conclusion

In this blog, we discussed what is JavaServer Faces and why you should use it. We also explored an introduction to key concepts in JavaServer Faces and its architecture. These concepts will help you to understand how JSF works.
