JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a component-based user interface (UI) framework for the Java EE platform. It is used to build web applications with a server-side user interface (UI). JSF is a part of the Java EE standard.

JSF is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. This design pattern separates the UI into three parts:

The model represents the data in the application.

The view is the UI that displays the data.

The controller handles user input and updates the model.

JSF components are reusable UI widgets that can be used in a view. JSF provides a standard set of components, but you can also create custom components. JSF components are connected to the model through value bindings. Value bindings allow a component to access data in the model.

JSF also provides a standard set of converters that can be used to convert data between different formats. For example, a converter can be used to convert a date from the format "MM/dd/yyyy" to the format "yyyy-MM-dd".

JSF provides two ways to create a view:

Facelets is a markup language that is used to create views in JSF. Facelets views are compiled into JavaServer Faces pages.

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that is used to create views in JSF. JSP pages are compiled into JavaServer Faces pages.

JSF pages are compiled into servlets that run on the server. When a user requests a JSF page, the server runs the servlet that is associated with the page. The servlet generates the HTML code that is sent to the client. The HTML code includes the JSF component tags that are used to render the UI widgets in the view.

When a user interacts with a UI widget, the widget sends an event to the server. The server uses an event handler to process the event. The event handler can update the model or invoke a method in the controller.

The controller contains the application logic. The controller can be implemented as a managed bean. A managed bean is a JavaBean that is managed by the JSF framework. Managed beans can be used to store data that is specific to a user session. They can also be used to invoke methods in the model or view.

JSF provides two ways to create managed beans:

The @ManagedBean annotation is used to create a managed bean. The annotation defines the name and scope of the bean.

The faces-config.xml file is used to create a managed bean. The file defines the name, class, and scope of the bean.

JSF also provides a standard set of tags that can be used in views. These tags are used to render UI widgets and to handle user input.
