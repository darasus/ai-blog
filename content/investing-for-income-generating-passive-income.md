## Basics of Investing for Income

Investing for income is all about generating a predictable, recurring stream of cash from your investment portfolio. In other words, your goal is to receive a regular payment from your investments — usually quarterly or annually — that covers your regular monthly expenses.

Investing for income is not the same thing as investing for growth. Most people who invest for income are not trying to beat the market or make a killing on their investments. Instead, they’re looking to generate a reliable and consistent stream of cash from their investments without much risk.

Investing for income isn’t for everyone, but it does have its advantages. Let’s say you’re a bit risk-averse, you’re in a high-interest rate environment, or you want to create a sustainable source of cash flow for your retirement. Investing for income via dividend-paying stocks, for example, could be a great option for you.

## Dividend-Paying Stocks

Most commonly associated with utility and telecommunications stocks, dividend-paying stocks represent shares in a company’s profit stream. And while share prices may go up or down depending on the performance of the company, the dividend payment will remain steady.

Stocks are a type of investment that you purchase in exchange for capital. The company will then use your capital to expand its business, hopefully growing and profiting in the process. In exchange for your capital, you’ll also receive regular payments — known as dividends — from the company as a form of compensation.

While the price of a stock can rise and fall with market conditions, dividend payments remain steady. That’s why dividend-paying stocks are a great choice for investing for income.

## Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

Real estate is an important part of most people’s financial portfolios. Whether you own a second home or a rental property, real estate can be a lucrative investment. And with real estate investment trusts (REITs), you can generate cash flow from your real estate portfolio.

REITs are companies that own and manage a variety of commercial properties — from hotels and supermarkets to hospitals and office buildings. While real estate can be lucrative, it’s also a very labor-intensive investment. That’s where REITs come in. REITs are actively managed funds that buy and sell commercial properties. You can buy shares in a REIT just like you would any other stock.

REITs are a great way to invest for income. The funds are managed by professionals and are generally diversified among many different properties. Because they own and manage commercial properties, REITs also have the potential to provide above-average growth in addition to the dividend stream.

## Mentioned alternatives

- Dividend stocks - Some dividend stocks, like utilities and telecom companies, have been some of the most reliable dividend payers in the market for decades.
- Bond funds - There are also bond funds that pay out reliable and consistent cash flows, although the amount you receive will vary depending on the current interest rate environment.

- Real estate - Real estate can be an excellent way to generate tax-advantaged cash flow from your investment portfolio.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - ETFs are a diverse group of stocks designed to track particular industries or regions of the world.
- Gold - Some people choose to invest in gold bullion, an easily exchangeable and liquid commodity that tends to be a safe and reliable investment.
- Alternative energy - Investing in solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources can be a good option for those interested in generating consistent cash flows from their investment portfolios.

## Exchange-Traded Funds that Pay Dividends

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of stocks designed to track a specific sector or industry, or to mimic the performance of an entire market index like the S&P 500. Many ETFs also pay dividends — including a few that actually pay out monthly dividends.

When you buy shares in an ETF, you’re investing in a basket of stocks selected by the fund manager. Because ETFs are actively managed funds, the fund manager is constantly buying and selling stocks in the basket to optimize the overall performance of the fund.

Many ETFs pay out a monthly dividend as a way to distribute the profits received from the basket of stocks. Some ETFs even pay out quarterly dividends, like a standard stock dividend. Depending on the particular ETF you choose, the dividends may be taxable or not.

## Conclusion

Investing for income is all about generating a predictable, recurring stream of cash from your investment portfolio. In other words, your goal is to receive a regular payment from your investments — usually quarterly or annually — that covers your regular monthly expenses.

Investing for income isn’t for everyone, but it does have its advantages. If you’re a bit risk-averse, you’re in a high-interest rate environment, or you want to create a sustainable source of cash flow for your retirement, investing for income can be a great option.

Stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investment types can generate regular streams of income from your portfolio. If you’re interested in investing for income, you just need to know where to look.
