There are many different ways to generate passive income. You can do it through real estate investing, stock market investing, or even by creating your own online course.

Real estate investing is a great way to generate passive income. You can buy properties and rent them out to tenants. The rent you collect can provide you with a steady stream of income.

Stock market investing is another way to generate passive income. You can buy stocks and hold them for the long term. As the stock prices increase, you will make money.

Creating your own online course is a great way to generate passive income. You can create a course on anything that you are passionate about. Once you create the course, you can sell it online and make money from it.
