This is a good sign if you want to be employed. The retention rate in the company among its employees is really high, and they are often given large bonuses. It is not an easy job, but there is a reason people want to stay on at Apple.\nThere are many theories as to why employees don\\u2019t leave the company. Apple is known for promoting from within, and its employees are given a lot of freedom when working on projects.

In fact, some say that it is undervalued and that Apple will soon be the first company in history to be valued at $1 trillion.

One of the biggest concerns in the finance industry today is the future of protection of user data.
