A C Corp is a for-profit corporation that\\u2019s formed by filing articles of incorporation and issuing shares to investors. Shareholders in a C Corp receive a W-2 form from the IRS each year and must report their earnings from the corporation on their personal income tax returns. In contrast, an S Corp is a for-profit corporation formed by filing articles of incorporation. Shareholders in an S Corp receive a K-1 form from the IRS each year and report the earnings from this corporation on their personal income tax returns. Another key difference between C Corps and S Corps is that C Corps can have an unlimited number of shareholders while an S Corp must have no more than 100 shareholders.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Hire a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Whether you choose to operate your business as an S Corp or a C Corp, it\\u2019s a good idea to hire a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to help you prepare your company\\u2019s annual tax return. A CPA will also be able to help you identify any areas in your business where you could be experiencing greater profits or seeing a higher return on the money that you\\u2019re currently investing in your company. Additionally, CPAs can help you project your current and expected future cash flow by running financial projections for your business.

Therefore, it\\u2019s important that you take the time to regularly review your company\\u2019s financial projections. You can use a spreadsheet or financial software program to project your company\\u2019s cash flow, operating expenses, and future capital requirements. This financial planning will help you identify areas in your company where you\\u2019re spending too much money and areas that you may be able to cut back on.
