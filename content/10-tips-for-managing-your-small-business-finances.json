Fortunately, these same technological advances have also made it easier for businesses to operate on a smaller scale with less capital. Over the last few decades, we\\u2019ve seen thousands of startups launch new products or services with very little upfront costs by incorporating as a small business instead of a larger corporation. There are many great benefits to operating your business as a Small Business Corporation (S Corp) rather than as a regular corporation (C Corp). When you operate your business as an S Corp, you can take advantage of what\\u2019s known as \\u201Cpass-through taxation.\\u201D A pass-through entity is one where shareholders report their shares on their personal tax returns rather than the company\\u2019s tax return.

Shareholders in a C Corp receive a W-2 form from the IRS each year and must report their earnings from the corporation on their personal income tax returns. In contrast, an S Corp is a for-profit corporation formed by filing articles of incorporation. Shareholders in an S Corp receive a K-1 form from the IRS each year and report the earnings from this corporation on their personal income tax returns.

Additionally, CPAs can help you project your current and expected future cash flow by running financial projections for your business.

Therefore, it\\u2019s important that you take the time to regularly review your company\\u2019s financial projections. You can use a spreadsheet or financial software program to project your company\\u2019s cash flow, operating expenses, and future capital requirements.

This will help you to determine when your company\\u2019s assets are no longer useful and should be replaced or retired. Keeping track of your company\\u2019s assets can also help you better understand the value of your business.
