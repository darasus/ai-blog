## Know your risk tolerance

Every investor is unique, which is why risk tolerance is so important. Risk tolerance is your ability to withstand fluctuations in the market. It will greatly impact your ability to make successful investments, as well as the type of stocks you choose to buy. If you’re a high-risk investor, you might choose to invest only in the stocks of large, established companies that you think will have lots of staying power. These stocks are less likely to experience major swings in the market because their value is well-known. They are more likely to be a safe bet for your portfolio.
If you’re a low-risk investor, you may choose to invest in startup companies with relatively low valuations that have a high growth potential. These stocks have a higher risk of failing, but if they succeed, the payoff will be worth it.

## Research the market and companies you’re considering

Depending on which type of stocks you choose, you may want to pick a concentrated portfolio of one or two types of stocks, or a diversified portfolio of many types of stocks. While you should always research the companies you’re considering, it’s especially important to do so when you’re picking stocks in a specific industry.
To make sure you’re not over- or under-invested in one type of stock, you’ll want to make sure that industry makes up between 10% and 25% of your portfolio. You can also diversify by investing in different types of industries. Be sure to account for how each industry might be affected by overall market fluctuations.

## Diversification is key

While you may want to focus on a few industries, it’s important to diversify your portfolio. This will help you avoid becoming overexposed to one industry. It’s also a great way to hedge against risk. If an industry suffers a significant loss, you can rest easy knowing that your portfolio is well diversified.
Diversification can be done a few different ways. You can choose to spread your money across multiple industries, or you can choose to spread it across different types of stocks within a particular industry. If you pick multiple industries, you may want to invest in stocks of companies that produce different types of products or provide different services. If you choose to diversify by type of stock within an industry, you may want to look for companies in different stages of growth.

## Estimate upside potential

The stock market is unpredictable, but you can still attempt to predict how much your stocks might rise. This will help you decide how much money you want to invest in each of your chosen stocks. If you invest in a handful of stocks and they all increase in value, you may not have enough money to buy more shares of each stock.
Depending on the type of stocks you choose, you may not be able to predict how much they might rise. However, you can still take into account the company’s history, the industry it’s in, and the general health of the economy when deciding how much money to invest.
Investing in a few stocks with a high potential for growth will give you a chance to significantly increase your portfolio’s value.

## Don’t rely on only one source for research

You can’t make sound investment decisions if you rely on a single source of information. You need to look at multiple perspectives in order to truly get a feel for the company. Make sure you visit company websites, read through annual reports, and browse through recent press releases. You should also consider reading industry reports and tracking down data on other industries that your stocks are associated with.
When you’re picking stocks, you may also want to consider tracking them using investment apps and services. This way, you can monitor your stocks and see how they are performing over time.

## Bottom line

The stock market is constantly changing, which means you have to be flexible when choosing stocks for your portfolio. When you’re picking stocks, you’ll want to consider your risk tolerance, the market as a whole, and the potential of each company you’re investing in. You should also research each company thoroughly and be sure to look at multiple sources of information.

If you want your investment portfolio to grow, you’ll need to pick the best stocks for your portfolio. Do your research, be flexible, and consider the future of the market when you’re picking stocks.
