It\\u2019s one of the most accessible forms of exercise; you can do it pretty much anywhere and at any time.

Running is a high-impact activity, so it may be a better choice for those who are new to exercise. You may have heard that running is better than walking for weight loss, but in truth, you can get pretty much the same benefits from either one. The real difference between the two is that running is more intense and requires more effort. This can be helpful if you\\u2019re trying to challenge yourself with a high-intensity workout. But if you\\u2019re just starting out (or even if you\\u2019re a veteran runner), high-intensity workouts can cause injury.

If you want to improve your health and fitness, you can start with one-minute intervals alternating with one-minute rest intervals. As you get fitter, you can increase the length of the intervals. Moderate runners can build up to 30 minutes per session, while serious runners can increase their time to an hour or more.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`If you\\u2019re training for an event like a marathon, you\\u2019ll need to do even more running, with more intensity and fewer breaks.

They use many of the same muscles and set off the same metabolic reactions in the body. So if you\\u2019re alternating between the two, you may get more benefits than if you were doing just one or the other. For example, combining walking and running can help you improve your aerobic fitness faster. You may also see faster improvements in your body weight, body shape, and body composition.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Because walking and running are both aerobic activities, they work together to increase your metabolism.
