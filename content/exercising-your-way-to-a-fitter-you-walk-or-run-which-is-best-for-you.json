You may have heard that running is better than walking for weight loss, but in truth, you can get pretty much the same benefits from either one. The real difference between the two is that running is more intense and requires more effort. This can be helpful if you\\u2019re trying to challenge yourself with a high-intensity workout. But if you\\u2019re just starting out (or even if you\\u2019re a veteran runner), high-intensity workouts can cause injury.
