Sarah\\u2019s light skin means she can pass as white but her brother cannot. Meanwhile, Nora\\u2019s dark skin means she can pass as black but her daughter cannot. As a child, Sarah is repeatedly told that because she is light-skinned, she is special and not like the other \\u2018darkies\\u2019. Yet when she grows up, her skin colour is a barrier to her happiness and she has to pass as white to find a suitable husband. Meanwhile, Nora is also told that she is special because she is dark-skinned, yet she is poor and cannot marry the man she loves. Both women feel that they are somehow betraying their identities when they are forced to pass as something they are not. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Passing and Authenticity\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When Nora\\u2019s son asks her if she is \\u201Cas black as \",\"[she]\",\" can be\\u201D, she replies, \\u201CI\\u2019m as black as I can afford to be!\\u201D This line expresses both the idea that to be as authentic as possible is to be genuine, yet it also references the fact that we all make choices about what level of \\u2018authenticity\\u2019 we present ourselves with. When Nora and George pass for white, they are not being authentic to themselves; they are choosing to present themselves as something they are not. When George tells his wife he would \\u201Crather be dead\\u201D than go back to Africa, he is being less authentic than Nora who has no problem returning home. Yet the two are punished for their choices with tragic consequences. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cultural Framing of Race\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This film critiques the idea that some races are naturally better than others. It is a common idea that leads to much of the discrimination and racism that exists in society. It is explored through the relationship between Sarah\\u2019s boyfriend Harry and her mother Nora. Harry is passionate about jazz and wants to be a professional singer, while Nora works as a waitress and is unimpressed by his \\u201Cnoisy music\\u201D. Nora refuses to see Harry as an equal, despite the fact that he is a hard-working, intelligent man who shares many of her interests. She refuses to acknowledge that he has the right to pursue his passions, and feels that he is less of a person because of his \\u2018lower-class\\u2019 status. While she does change her mind about Harry and recognises his worth later in the story, this scene offers insight into the ways cultural prejudice can affect our relationships. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Classism\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Classism is the privileging of one segment of society over another based on their financial status. In the film, George is the son of a rich man, who prefers to keep him in the poorer section of the business so he can remain in control. When George and Nora fall in love, she cannot be with him because of his social class. Later, when George has changed his appearance and is posing as a white man, he is able to be with Vida, a rich woman who is his new employer\\u2019s daughter. This film explores the idea that appearances are what matter most in society, and that a person\\u2019s social class is the most important thing about them. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Pansexuality?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"During the film, George often comments that he \\u201Cthinks like a woman\\u201D. He is shown to have a remarkably empathetic nature that likely has something to do with his decision to marry Vida and pass as white. He recognizes that her desire to marry a white man stems from a desire to be admired and validated by everyone around her. Yet he is also shown to be a devoted father and husband and genuinely in love with Vida. George is also impulsive and temperamental, making impulsive decisions that do not always work out for the best. Despite this, he is given the label of \\u2018woman\\u2019, suggesting that he is not a man to be taken seriously because of his emotional tendencies. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Released in the year of cinema\\u2019s first black Best Actor winner, this film is a thought-provoking melodrama about passing as a marker of authenticity.
