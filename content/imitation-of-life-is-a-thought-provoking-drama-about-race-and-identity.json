As a child, Sarah is repeatedly told that because she is light-skinned, she is special and not like the other \\u2018darkies\\u2019. Yet when she grows up, her skin colour is a barrier to her happiness and she has to pass as white to find a suitable husband.

Nora refuses to see Harry as an equal, despite the fact that he is a hard-working, intelligent man who shares many of her interests. She refuses to acknowledge that he has the right to pursue his passions, and feels that he is less of a person because of his \\u2018lower-class\\u2019 status.

Later, when George has changed his appearance and is posing as a white man, he is able to be with Vida, a rich woman who is his new employer\\u2019s daughter.

Yet he is also shown to be a devoted father and husband and genuinely in love with Vida. George is also impulsive and temperamental, making impulsive decisions that do not always work out for the best.

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The Korean sextet has made a name for itself as not just another boy band but one that plays its own instruments and has choreographed dance routines that are so intricate they sometimes require special stage lighting.\nArmed with these weapons, BTS has twice cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart with its Love Yourself series. And the latest installment of this series \\u2014 which doubles as its sixth EP \\u2014 is no exception.\nFurthermore, it\\u2019s the strongest of the bunch.\nIt\\u2019s impossible to talk about BTS without mentioning their massive following beyond Korea: Vivid, obsessive ARMYs (as they call them) who follow their every move and buy everything associated with them. This is why many people assume they are only famous because of social media and pandering ads (which is true). However, anyone who listens to their music will tell you that they deserve all this success. \\u201CLove Yourself: Tear\\u201D proves it once again.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In fact, there are a number of rappers who have been working hard to maintain their integrity while still appealing to a larger audience.

The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure.

In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
