Maybe it\\u2019s the pressure to impress both new listeners and old fans, or simply the natural progression of any band that leaves them feeling eager to experiment. Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
