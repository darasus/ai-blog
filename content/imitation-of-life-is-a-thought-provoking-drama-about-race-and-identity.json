As a child, Sarah is repeatedly told that because she is light-skinned, she is special and not like the other \\u2018darkies\\u2019. Yet when she grows up, her skin colour is a barrier to her happiness and she has to pass as white to find a suitable husband.

Nora refuses to see Harry as an equal, despite the fact that he is a hard-working, intelligent man who shares many of her interests. She refuses to acknowledge that he has the right to pursue his passions, and feels that he is less of a person because of his \\u2018lower-class\\u2019 status.

Later, when George has changed his appearance and is posing as a white man, he is able to be with Vida, a rich woman who is his new employer\\u2019s daughter.

Yet he is also shown to be a devoted father and husband and genuinely in love with Vida. George is also impulsive and temperamental, making impulsive decisions that do not always work out for the best.

But there are still some great pop albums that aren\\u2019t filled with auto-tune and EDM drops.On May 25th, the Scottish band Chvrches released their third album called \\u201C Love is Dead.\\u201D The synth-pop band has lots of happy vibes and catchy hooks on their new album. It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
