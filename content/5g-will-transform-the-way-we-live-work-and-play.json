These AI helpers are no longer just for tech-savvy adults; now, kids as young as five are happily chattering away with cartoon characters like Waffle the Blue Whale or Hank the Crab whenever they need help with something.\nHowever, AI isn\\u2019t solely limited to helpful sea creatures or talking speakers. In fact, AI is being used for all kinds of purposes \\u2013 from self-driving cars to replacing call center agents with intelligent chatbots. Even businesses are seeing the value in incorporating AI into their day-to-day operations. From automating processes to making data-driven decisions faster, businesses of all sizes can leverage the benefits of AI in order to improve their services and workflows.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, Apple Inc remains one of the most successful companies worldwide. In the last few years, particularly after 2013, Apple has lost some of its luster.

Users who upgrade to Windows 10 can no longer trust their computer or the software that runs on it.\nWhen you use Windows 10, Microsoft collects personal information about you, your device usage habits, and apps that you install; all of which is transmitted back to the company in an unencrypted format.

This led to Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs\\u2019 friend) proposing that they start their own computer company \\u2013 which became known as Apple Computer Inc.\nWhat follows is a detailed look into the history of Apple Inc., including details about key executives and any relevant organizational changes.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
