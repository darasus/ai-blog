  "summary": "There is no set date for the global rollout of 5G networks. Commercial networks will not be up and running in their final form until 2019 or 2020. 5G will eventually be capable of providing speeds that are up to 10 times faster than what’s possible with 4G LTE. In the US, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint have all announced plans to launch limited 5G services in select cities in the first half of next year. In Europe, Vodafone, Orange, Swisscom, Telefonica, BT, and Three have all signed on to participate in 5G trials.",
  "intro": "High-speed mobile internet is about to get a whole lot faster. The world is on the cusp of an exciting new era in wireless technology, as the rollout of fifth generation (5G) cellular networks begins across the globe.\nEven though 4G LTE coverage is widespread and newer 5G networks aren’t quite ready for large-scale implementation just yet, carriers around the world are already testing out pre-Release 15 5G network services. Several national operators have already begun deploying their 5G network infrastructure, while others are set to follow suit in the coming months. The race is on to lead the way in this cutting-edge technology and reap the benefits that come with it. It’s a fast-moving space, so here’s everything you need to know about 5G and when you can expect it to launch where you live.",
  "content": "## What is 5G?\n\nThe fifth generation of wireless technology is the successor to 4G LTE. It’s an all-encompassing term that carriers use to describe their upcoming network upgrade, but it doesn’t refer to any specific technology. The 5G designation is mainly being used as a marketing tool to generate hype around the rollout of new networks, which is set to take place over the next few years.\n\nIn order for a network to be considered 5G, it must meet certain specifications laid out by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). There are several existing 5G standards being developed and tested, but only the latest one is positioned to offer the large capacity, ultra-low latency, and massive MIMO (multi-input and multi-output) capabilities that will make it a true game changer.\n\n## When is the 5G rollout happening?\n\nThere is no set date for the global rollout of 5G networks. The standard rollout date of early 2020 is not realistic. The spectrum and infrastructure build-out don’t allow that. It’s more realistic to expect 5G to launch in the next two to three years. But it’s important to note that the 5G standard has only recently been finalized, so commercial networks will not be up and running in their final form until the end of 2019 or 2020 at the earliest.\n\nThe earliest 5G networks are expected to go live in 2019. In the US, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint have all announced plans to launch limited 5G services in select cities in the first half of next year. In Europe, Vodafone, Orange, Swisscom, Telefonica, BT, and Three have all signed on to participate in the 5G trials being conducted by the Next Generation Mobile Networks consortium, which aims to introduce 5G services in several European cities in 2019. Japan is also set to begin 5G commercial trials in 2019, with the commercial launch expected in 2020.\n\n## Where will 5G be launched first?\n\nEach operator will be able to offer 5G coverage in at least one or two cities within the first year of commercial service.\nDepending on who you ask, the answer to this question varies. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile all say they’ll launch 5G in a select number of cities before the end of 2018. Meanwhile, Sprint is aiming for a full nationwide rollout in early 2019.\n\nIn terms of which operator will be first out of the gate, the race is between AT&T and Verizon. Verizon plans to launch 5G in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento in the first half of 2019, while AT&T is looking to deploy 5G in Atlanta, Dallas, and Waco at the same time.\n\n## 5G benefits for consumers\n\nAt the moment, there is no network that can be called 5G. The official standards for 5G have only just been finalized, so networks that are being built with this in mind are not yet up and running. When the new networks do launch, however, consumers can expect to enjoy significantly faster data speeds and lower latency than is possible with current 4G networks.\n\nAccording to the initial findings of a new report by Signals Research Group, 5G will eventually be capable of providing speeds that are up to 10 times faster than what’s possible with 4G LTE. This will translate to lower latency and faster response times across a wide variety of 5G applications, including gaming, virtual reality, smart cities, autonomous cars, robotics, and more.\n\n## Limitations of the current 5G standard\n\nIn order to ensure backward compatibility with the existing 4G LTE architecture, 5G uses the same frequencies as 4G (between the 700 MHz and 6 GHz bands). This is important to note, as it means there is a limited amount of available spectrum for 5G networks.\n\n4G LTE currently operates on about 15% of the available spectrum, but 5G’s greater efficiency means that operators will need a larger chunk of that spectrum to achieve the same level of throughput. In total, 5G will require about 80% of the available spectrum, meaning that some LTE frequencies will have to be repurposed for 5G. This could create short-term capacity issues in the LTE network.\n\n## When will we have full 5G?\n\nIn order to be considered a true 5G network, a network must meet certain key criteria. The network must have low latency, high capacity, and be able to provide network connectivity in both indoor and outdoor environments.\n\nThe first 5G standard, known as Release 15, only meets the first two criteria. Release 16, which is set to be finalized in 2020, will meet all three. When operators launch their first 5G networks, they will be using the Release 15 standard. When these networks are upgraded to the Release 16 standard, they will be considered full 5G networks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe fifth generation of cellular network technology promises to transform the way people live, work, and play. From faster data speeds and lower latency to new uses in emerging technologies like virtual reality and smart cities, 5G is set to revolutionize the way we communicate.\nThere is no set date for the global rollout of 5G networks. The earliest 5G networks are expected to go live in select cities in the first half of 2019.\nThere are several existing 5G standards being developed and tested, but only the latest one is positioned to offer the large capacity, ultra-low latency, and massive MIMO capabilities that will make it a true game changer."
