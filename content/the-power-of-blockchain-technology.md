  The world is changing fast. Digital transformation of businesses and the
  digital revolution are here to stay. New technologies such as artificial
  intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and virtual reality
  are reshaping the way we live, work, and conduct business.

  The digital transformation is moving businesses from operational excellence to strategic differentiation by integrating new digital technologies that are changing the way we do business in industries like healthcare, retail, logistics, etc. The pace of this change is accelerating with new software platforms fostering innovation — bringing us a world where artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and blockchain are commonplace. 

  These transformative technologies also open up opportunities for new collaborations between individuals and organizations at different scales. They empower people with new ways to directly exchange value between each other without intermediaries — in other words, peer-to-peer transactions. Here’s an overview of how blockchain technology can help you take your organization to the next level.

## Why is Blockchain Technology Important?

Blockchain technology is a digital distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and decentralized manner. It is fast becoming the foundation of transformation across industries as we move from an Industrial Age to the Information Age. Blockchain technology can be used for anything from digital identity management to facilitating peer-to-peer transactions.
There are some key advantages to blockchain technology.

First, it is tamper-proof. Because the blockchain is distributed across thousands of computers, it is extremely difficult to hack. The data can also be traced to its origins. Coupled with artificial intelligence, blockchain is poised to be a game changer especially in product supply chains where provenance and authenticity are critical.

Second, blockchains are transparent and open-source. This means that anyone can see the activities on the network, but that no single person can control the network. Anyone can join the network and participate in the activities.

## Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that uses a consensus protocol to ensure the veracity of the data held within the network. It relies on a peer-to-peer network of computers that are equally responsible for validating transactions.
The blockchain is made up of a chain of blocks of information (hence the name). Each block contains information about the transaction that was verified by the network, a timestamp, and other metadata related to the transaction.

## How Blockchain Helps Small Businesses

With blockchain, small businesses can collaborate with partners and suppliers anywhere in the world using smart contracts to automate business processes, reduce costs, and increase speed to market.
At the same time, blockchain’s transparency and traceability help small business owners prove the provenance of their products and services. They allow small businesses to reduce risk and increase trust with customers.
Let’s dive a bit deeper into each of these benefits.

Reduced Costs and Fees - Blockchain allows organizations to reduce transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions. At the same time, blockchain helps parties reduce the risk of fraud by increasing transparency and improving trust.
Small businesses can therefore cut down on the costs and fees associated with financial transactions and cross-border payments.

## Blockchain Helps Small-Medium Businesses With Financial Services

Blockchain enables organizations to offer financial services with lower costs and greater accessibility for the unbanked or underbanked. It can be used to design and deploy financial products, such as investing, lending, insurance, and savings, in a peer-to-peer manner.
This means that small-medium businesses can offer financial services to their customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.

## Blockchain Helps Small-Medium Businesses With Supply Chain and Provenance

At the heart of every business transaction is trust. If a business can prove the provenance of its products and services, it can build trust with customers. This is particularly important when dealing with food and pharmaceutical products.
But small-medium businesses often struggle with the costs and complexity of tracking products through supply chains and ensuring their provenance.
Blockchain can help by providing businesses with a transparent, auditable, and tamper-proof way of tracking their products from source to shelf using an immutable ledger.

## Blockchain Helps Small-Medium Businesses With Transparency and Traceability

Transparency and traceability are crucial in sectors such as the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and fashion industries. This is particularly true in the wake of scandals, such as the horsemeat scandal, the Chinese milk scandal, and the false positive scandal involving PEDs (performance-enhancing drugs).
Blockchain technology offers a much-needed solution that can reassure consumers and help businesses comply with regulations.

## Conclusion

Digital transformation demands a significant investment in new technology. However, organizations should not see this investment as a fixed cost but as a variable cost that can be reduced by adopting blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology can help small-medium businesses reduce costs and increase efficiencies by powering peer-to-peer transactions. It can also help businesses reduce their risk of fraud and provide customers with transparency and traceability.
