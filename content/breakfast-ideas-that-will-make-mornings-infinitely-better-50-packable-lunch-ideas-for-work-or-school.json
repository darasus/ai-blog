Most types of fruit also happen to be very low in calories, which means that you can eat as much as you want without putting on any unwanted pounds!

In fact, eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast has been shown to reduce the amount of gas and bloating that some people experience after eating a meal.

If you like to eat a slice of toast with peanut butter or nutella for breakfast, you may want to try eating a smaller slice of bread than you normally do, or limiting yourself to just one piece of toast.

So how should you deal with food trends? Do we follow them? Ignore them? Or just give them a lukewarm response?\nFollow food trends if it makes sense for your business, and use them as a way to stay ahead of competitors and gain new customers. Following trends gives your business an opportunity to attract new customers by keeping your place relevant with the latest tastes and preferences. At the same time, ignoring popular foods can also be risky as that can alienate potential patrons who are looking for those options when they come to dine at your establishment.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
