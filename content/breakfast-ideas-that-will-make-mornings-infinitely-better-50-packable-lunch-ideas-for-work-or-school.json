We drank glass after glass of orange juice, ate a piece of toast with peanut butter and maybe even gulped down a bowl of cereal or a few crackers with cheese. But once we hit high school, things started to get a little more complicated.\nThat\\u2019s because by the time most people reach their late teens, their bodies have developed an increasing need for more complex nutrients to fuel our minds and bodies throughout the day. Instead of drinking glasses of juice and eating crackers with cheese in the morning, most adults need to eat something that is substantial enough to keep them going until lunchtime. Thankfully, there are plenty of easy ways to accomplish this feat while also saving time and money at the same time!

This will give your body the probiotics it needs to function properly throughout the day, while also providing a decent amount of vitamins and minerals from the fruit. Most types of fruit also happen to be very low in calories, which means that you can eat as much as you want without putting on any unwanted pounds! A greek yogurt and fruit bowl is also a great choice if you happen to be a vegan or are looking to eat fewer animal products because plain greek yogurt is one of the best sources of calcium around!\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The only real downside to eating a greek yogurt and fruit bowl is that it\\u2019s not the most filling option out there.

In that case, you may want to try one of the other suggestions on this list instead.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Bowl of oatmeal\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you are the type of person who eats a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast almost every single day, you are doing a lot of things right. Oatmeal is one of the best foods to eat for breakfast because it is high in fiber and protein, two nutrients that are essential for proper digestion. In fact, eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast has been shown to reduce the amount of gas and bloating that some people experience after eating a meal. Oatmeal is also one of the best foods to eat if you are trying to lose weight since it is low in calories and high in fiber, which can help you feel full for a long time. Oatmeal is a great source of beta-glucan, a type of fibre proven to significantly reduce cholesterol, which means that it can help reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease over time. It is also rich in antioxidants and minerals that can help protect your body from the damaging effects of free radicals!\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you love eating oatmeal for breakfast, but want to change things up a bit, you can always try adding fresh berries, dried cranberries, nuts, and/or seeds to your bowl for some extra flavor and texture!\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Toast with peanut butter or nutella\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you want to eat something that is both very filling and low in calories, a slice of toast with peanut butter or nutella can be a great option.

Whole-wheat bread is a good source of dietary fiber, which has been proven to reduce cholesterol, as well as a source of vitamin B, which helps improve your mood. It is also a decent source of iron, which is an essential nutrient for maintaining good health.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Peanut butter and nutella are both very high in calories, but they also contain protein and other nutrients that can keep you full for quite a long time. If you like to eat a slice of toast with peanut butter or nutella for breakfast, you may want to try eating a smaller slice of bread than you normally do, or limiting yourself to just one piece of toast. This is because both peanut butter and nutella are very high in calories, and if you eat too much of them, you may end up consuming more calories than you need, which can lead to weight gain.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Egg muffin\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you are someone who loves eggs for breakfast, but needs to find a way to make them more nutritious, you can try making egg muffins. Egg muffins are like a breakfast sandwich, only they are baked in a muffin pan instead of being squished between a bun. You can make egg muffins with almost any type of filling, but some of the most popular combinations are ham, cheese, and eggs, or sausage and eggs. You can also add veggies like peppers, onions, and/or mushrooms to give the muffins more flavor and nutrients.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Eating egg muffins is a great way to get more protein into your diet while also reducing the amount of calories and fat you consume each day. However, if you eat these every day, you may want to consider eating fewer muffins each day so you don\\u2019t end up eating more calories than you need. Eating too many calories can lead to weight gain if you aren\\u2019t being active enough to burn them off.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Microwave egg wrap\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another great way to make eggs more nutritious is to eat them in a wrap. There are many different types of wraps on the market these days, but many of them don\\u2019t have much nutritional value.

You can also add vegetables to your wrap, such as peppers and onions, to give it more taste and nutrients.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Eating a wrap with eggs is a great way to get more fiber into your diet while also reducing the amount of calories you consume.

You can either buy a premade protein shake, or you can make your own using protein powder. You can find many different kinds of protein powder at health food stores, as well as online. Many of them come in flavors like chocolate or vanilla, which makes drinking them more enjoyable.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Drinking a protein shake for breakfast is a great way to get more protein and nutrients into your diet while also reducing the amount of calories you consume.

Doing so will give you a ton of fiber while also giving your body a decent amount of vitamins from the vegetables.

Many commercial brands contain preservatives and added sugars, so if you want to eat a healthier version, you can make it at home using dried chickpeas.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Eating hummus with vegetables is a great way to get more fiber into your diet while also reducing the amount of calories you consume.

You just need to make sure that the cereal you eat is low in sugar and high in fiber, like many of the varieties made by Special K and Fiber One, for example. You can also add fruits and nuts to your cereal to make it more nutritious. You can go even further by making your own granola at home. Granola is a great source of fiber, plus it can be made with many different types of seeds and nuts to make it healthier, like pecans and almonds, for example.

However, it can also feel like a challenge at times: when there\\u2019s nothing in your CSA box but potatoes for the third week in a row or another arctic blast has come and gone without leaving behind any winter squash\\u2026 What are you supposed to do?\nAnd truth be told, there are some downsides involved with eating seasonally. For example, it might feel more expensive to buy vegetables only when they\\u2019re in season; that may not always be the case, but often the non-seasonal price is lower because they are grown more efficiently with fewer inputs on an industrial scale.\nHowever, there are plenty of upsides too! Eating seasonally means that you get to enjoy different flavors throughout the year \\u2014 which is something many people don\\u2019t tend to do.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
