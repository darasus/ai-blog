summary: You never know what you'll find to eat once you’re out in the world.
  Having your own food can help you avoid overspending or consuming food that
  isn’t healthy for you. Eating local cuisine will help you appreciate the
  culture or area you're in and it will also help to avoid eating unhealthy fast
  food. If you have a long road trip ahead of you, you can always pack some nuts
  or trail mix in your bag. You can also always take a bag of carrots with you
  on the plane to munch on once in the air.
intro: >-
  Going on a road trip, catching an early morning flight or going to your
  new internship for the first time can all be stressful. You have to leave home
  at ungodly hours to get there on time, you have to read through pages of
  instructions and you might even have to fend for yourself without your
  parents’ help. This is where packing healthy snacks comes in handy.

  On-the-go food isn’t always healthy and nutritious. With more fast food chains popping up everywhere, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for us to find healthy meals that are also quick and convenient to eat. If you find yourself caught off guard by these circumstances often, here are some tips on how you can eat healthy while traveling or commuting.

## Pack your own food

You never know what you’ll find to eat once you’re out in the world. Sometimes, you run into places that don’t even serve food, let alone healthy snacks. Other times, you run into places where the food isn’t healthy. If you have a lot of traveling to do, or you have an early morning flight to catch, it’s a good idea to pack some food for the trip. You can make a quick stop at the grocery store for some fruit and vegetables or you can pick up some protein bars or nuts at the airport or on your way to the airport.

You should also keep a water bottle in your bag or in your car so that you’re always prepared. Having your own food can help you avoid overspending or consuming food that isn’t healthy for you. While you may be able to find some healthy snacks at the airport, it’s likely that they’re fairly expensive.

## Try out local cuisine

While you should still pack your own food, you should also try to eat some local cuisine while you’re traveling. This will help you appreciate the culture or area you’re in and it will also help you avoid eating unhealthy fast food. You should always travel with an open mind and try new things. This isn’t just true for traveling; it’s also true for eating.

If you’re staying with a host family while abroad, ask them what they usually eat. If you’re staying in a hotel, look up the best restaurants in the area. You may even want to ask your new friends where they like to go. If you’re going abroad to study or work, ask your classmates or coworkers where they like to go.

## Eat protein-rich meals

Protein is a must-have in any healthy diet. It’s great for your muscles, bones and skin and it’s also good for your digestive system. Protein is found in fish, beans, nuts, eggs, milk and yogurt. You can pair these with some healthy carbs to create a balanced meal.
If you have a long road trip ahead of you, you can always pack some nuts or trail mix in your bag. If you have an early morning flight, you can grab an egg or yogurt wrap or get a milk or yogurt smoothie to go. You can also always take a bag of carrots with you on the plane to munch on once in the air.

## Choose whole wheat bread and crackers

You can always ask for a side of whole wheat bread at a restaurant, but it’s always better to bring your own. You can also pick up a couple of whole wheat crackers at the airport before you board your flight. If you’re flying with a friend, you can always share.
If you’re staying at a friend’s place or at a hotel, you can always ask the kitchen staff at the hotel if they have any whole wheat bread or crackers. If they don’t, you can always pick up some at the grocery store.

## Don’t forget the veggies and fruits

Veggies and fruits are always a healthy choice, no matter what. You can always pick up some carrots or apples at the grocery store before you go or you can ask a friend if they have some in their fridge.
If you’re staying in a hotel, you can always ask the kitchen staff if they have any vegetables or fruits lying around. If not, you can always go to the grocery store and pick some up.

## Conclusion

Eating healthy while you’re on the go isn’t an easy task — especially when you’re not used to it. It takes time and a lot of preparation, and it’s certainly not something that you can do overnight. With these tips, you’ll be able to eat healthy on the go and be prepared for whatever life throws at you.
