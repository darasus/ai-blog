There is a general feeling that something big is about to happen. The Internet as we know it is changing, and new ways to use data are being invented every day. In this rapidly shifting landscape, blockchain technology stands out as one of the most disruptive innovations.\nBut what exactly is blockchain technology? In a nutshell, it\\u2019s a decentralized ledger that stores information in places called blocks. Whenever someone wants to add information or a transaction to the ledger, they first need to verify themselves by supplying proof of identity. Each block also has its own unique identifier known as a hash. These identifiers help track information easily without having to store an entire copy of each block, which reduces space significantly and speeds up data transfer speeds significantly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s a type of database that allows all parties to interact, transact, and share data from anywhere in the world. Blockchain\\u2019s distributed network lets people who don\\u2019t know each other exchange value through secure digital contracts, with no need for a third party to validate or enforce the terms of the agreement.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Blockchain technology uses a consensus mechanism to validate transactions, which makes it very transparent. The system can\\u2019t be altered or hacked because each block is linked to the previous block, and changing one block would change the rest of the chain. However, the system can be amended if the parties involved decide to alter the terms of their agreement.

At the same time, consumers are increasingly distrustful of the advertising they see. It\\u2019s important that marketers find ways to overcome these challenges while also meeting their contractual obligations with publishers. Blockchain technology can help by providing a more secure and transparent way to manage ad spend.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For example, you can use blockchain technology to store the terms and conditions that govern your advertising spend. The data can be stored in a single, unchangeable location and be easily verified by the parties involved.

If you consider the current systems used to validate identity, they\\u2019re relatively slow and lack transparency. Blockchain can speed up the process while also increasing the level of transparency involved. Data stored on a blockchain can be verified quickly and easily. You can also use blockchain to store sensitive data without the need for an intermediary.

It\\u2019s also possible to create a system that lets different entities interact and share data. For example, you could use blockchain to let health insurance providers exchange data with doctors.

These digital contracts can automate payment based on the results of an analysis.

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!
