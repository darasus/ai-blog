One big downside is taxes. The government taxes capital gains, the profit you make when you sell an investment after it has gone up in value. The tax rate on capital gains can vary depending on how long you hold your investment. If you sell it after one year, the tax rate is usually the same as your ordinary income tax rate. After one year, your investment is also subject to the paid taxes, fees and bumps along the road. If you sell it after one year, the investment company will deduct a fee for transferring the money into your bank account. And some investments may also have additional fees. Be sure to look for investments that don\\u2019t charge fees. Also, be prepared for bumps along the road.
