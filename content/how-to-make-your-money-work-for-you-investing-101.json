Speculation, on the other hand, often involves risky high-return bets that can lead to quick profits or losses.

Instead, focus on asset allocation. Asset allocation means you decide how much of your money you want to invest in different types of assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. The more you diversify your money across different types of assets, the lower the risk of losing money. That\\u2019s because if one type of investment loses value, you can rely on the others to make up for it. This is particularly helpful as you get older and closer to retirement. Why? Because if one type of investment loses value (say, the stock market crashes), you have other sources of income you can rely on to fund your retirement. This can be an especially smart strategy if you\\u2019re young and have time on your side.

You may not have much cash to put toward your investments, but every little bit helps. Start out small and work your way up.

Investing when you\\u2019re young can help you earn compound interest over time and grow your money much faster than if you start investing when you\\u2019re older. This is because as you get older, you have more responsibilities, like a mortgage, car payments, and maybe even kids. These expenses can eat up your cash and make it more difficult to save.

One big downside is taxes. The government taxes capital gains, the profit you make when you sell an investment after it has gone up in value. The tax rate on capital gains can vary depending on how long you hold your investment. If you sell it after one year, the tax rate is usually the same as your ordinary income tax rate. After one year, your investment is also subject to the paid taxes, fees and bumps along the road. If you sell it after one year, the investment company will deduct a fee for transferring the money into your bank account. And some investments may also have additional fees. Be sure to look for investments that don\\u2019t charge fees. Also, be prepared for bumps along the road. Even the best-laid plans may face some bumps like a market correction or economic downturn that may temporarily drop the value of some investments.

It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times\\u2014not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. As a result, your average cost per share is lower than if you had invested the entire amount at once.\nAs an example, let\\u2019s assume an investor has $10,000 to invest in stocks and has been debating between two companies: ABC stock and XYZ stock. If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then.
