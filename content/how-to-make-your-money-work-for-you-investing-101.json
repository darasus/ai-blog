Speculation is the short-term buying and selling of assets in hopes of getting rich quickly. Investing is a process, while speculation is a mindset. While both processes can yield profits, successful investing requires a longer-term strategy and patience. Speculation, on the other hand, often involves risky high-return bets that can lead to quick profits or losses. Investing is about building real, long-term wealth that can help you pay for your car, house, and retirement. Speculation is about gambling and getting lucky. It can lead to quick riches, but is also just as likely to lead to quick losses.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Asset allocation is key\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The biggest mistake people make when they start investing is they try to pick stocks.

Instead, focus on asset allocation. Asset allocation means you decide how much of your money you want to invest in different types of assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. The more you diversify your money across different types of assets, the lower the risk of losing money. That\\u2019s because if one type of investment loses value, you can rely on the others to make up for it. This is particularly helpful as you get older and closer to retirement. Why? Because if one type of investment loses value (say, the stock market crashes), you have other sources of income you can rely on to fund your retirement. This can be an especially smart strategy if you\\u2019re young and have time on your side.

You may not have much cash to put toward your investments, but every little bit helps. Start out small and work your way up. You can also join a program like Robin Hood, which is a free stock-trading app that lets you start with as little as $100. Investing when you\\u2019re young can help you earn compound interest over time and grow your money much faster than if you start investing when you\\u2019re older. This is because as you get older, you have more responsibilities, like a mortgage, car payments, and maybe even kids. These expenses can eat up your cash and make it more difficult to save. When you\\u2019re young, though, you likely don\\u2019t have those same expenses. This means you have more cash on hand to put toward investments.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Help!

You can invest in low-risk, low-return investments like certificates of deposit (CDs) or savings accounts. You may not see a lot of growth on these accounts, but at least you won\\u2019t lose money if the market takes a dive.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can also invest in safer stocks.

One big downside is taxes. The government taxes capital gains, the profit you make when you sell an investment after it has gone up in value. The tax rate on capital gains can vary depending on how long you hold your investment. If you sell it after one year, the tax rate is usually the same as your ordinary income tax rate. After one year, your investment is also subject to the paid taxes, fees and bumps along the road. If you sell it after one year, the investment company will deduct a fee for transferring the money into your bank account. And some investments may also have additional fees. Be sure to look for investments that don\\u2019t charge fees. Also, be prepared for bumps along the road. Even the best-laid plans may face some bumps like a market correction or economic downturn that may temporarily drop the value of some investments. Don\\u2019t let a little turbulence get in the way of your investment strategy.
