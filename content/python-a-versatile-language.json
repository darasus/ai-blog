Most people use their phones for either calling, texting or browsing the Internet. The world has moved on from feature phones to smartphones, which are more than just mobile phones. Smartphones come with pre-installed apps such as cameras, video players, and messaging services. Moreover, they also support third-party apps like music streaming services and games. Today\\u2019s mobile users expect their devices to be more than just communication tools; they want them to be an extension of their digital lifestyle. Therefore, developers need to create apps that take advantage of the smaller screen size and speed up load times by storing data locally where possible. There are many different programming languages used to make mobile applications; however, we will cover four of the most commonly used ones:\nSoftware development companies generally have some standard set of programming languages that they prefer working with. When it comes to mobile app development you might find one language rising above the rest based on its popularity among developers as well as other factors such as job demand for that specific language.
