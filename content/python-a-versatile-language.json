While it\\u2019s not the simplest language that exists, it falls somewhere in the middle \\u2013 meaning that it will be easier for a beginner to understand, but it\\u2019s also powerful enough for an experienced programmer to use.\nWhen you\\u2019re just getting started programming, you don\\u2019t want to have to deal with a language that\\u2019s overly complicated or confusing. You\\u2019re trying to learn the basics, and a complicated language will just make that more difficult.\nPython is a great language for beginners to start out with because it\\u2019s easy read and understand.
