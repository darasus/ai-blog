intro: >-
  You know that healthy eating is important and that you should make it a
  priority, but with so much going on in your life right now, it can feel like
  an impossible goal to achieve. Between work, school, volunteering, and
  friends, it can seem like there are not enough hours in the day to get
  everything done. Eating well often feels like yet another thing you need to
  add to your endless list of responsibilities and obligations.

  But making great food choices doesn’t have to take up a lot of time or feel like a chore. There are lots of simple things you can do every day that will help you make eating well a top priority. Even if your schedule seems packed, these small changes will help you get the nutrition your body needs without taking up too much of your time or energy.

## Make Eating Well A Ritual

When you make healthy eating a ritual, you strengthen that habit. When you have healthy eating rituals, you're more likely to make good choices.

A lot of people think that healthy eating means skipping meals or having small portions. But research shows that eating three balanced meals each day is one of the best ways to make sure you get the nutrition your body needs.
There are lots of healthy foods that can make great snacks, but the key to eating well isn’t starving yourself or eating a very small amount of food. Eating more often means you’ll get more nutrients and energy throughout the day so you won’t be starving and more likely to overeat later.
In addition to eating more often, there are also a few other healthy habits you should incorporate into your daily routine.

## Plan Your Meals

It can be really helpful to plan your meals for the week. When you already know what you are going to be eating, there is less chance that you will overeat or choose unhealthy options when you get hungry at odd times throughout the day.
If you know you have a big event coming up or have to spend a lot of time at work, it can be helpful to pre-make some of your meals. For example, you can make a bunch of salads or throw together a few baked goods over the weekend so you have something nutritious and easy to grab during the week.

## Commit To Healthy Breakfasts

Many people skip breakfast or eat unhealthy foods, because they aren’t hungry in the morning or don’t have time to make anything. But eating a healthy breakfast helps get your day off to a great start.
When you eat a nutritious breakfast every day, you are more likely to stay full throughout the day, avoid overeating at lunch, and have more energy so you can focus better at work or school.

## Don’t Be Afraid Of Leftovers

Many people only make enough food for one meal and then end up eating leftovers for several days in a row. This can be a great way to make healthy eating easier, but it can also get boring.
When you are eating the same thing every day, it is less likely you will get all the nutrients your body needs. So mix it up and try to cook enough food to last you three or four days.

## Find Healthy Ingredients You Like

If you love eating healthy food, then this is definitely the best option for you. But if you are not very fond of the healthy options you have to choose from, it can be hard to incorporate them into your diet.
When you are trying new foods, it is easy to fall into the trap of only buying what you know and like. But if you try a few new healthy ingredients from time to time, you will discover lots of new foods that you really enjoy.

## Take Care Of Yourself

Eating well is important, but so is self-care. If your schedule is jam packed, it is easy to say “I don’t have time to exercise” or “I don’t have time to do yoga.” But if you don’t make time for self-care, you are more likely to feel stressed, tired, and sick.
When you take care of yourself and make healthy choices, you are much more likely to feel your best. So don’t just focus on healthy eating; make sure you are getting enough sleep and are taking care of your mental health as well.
