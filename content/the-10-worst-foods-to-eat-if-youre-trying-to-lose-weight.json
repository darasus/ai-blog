  "summary": "Eating lots of cheese can set you up for weight gain because you’ll be consuming a lot of fat and very few nutrients, which will slow down your weight-loss progress. Avoid processed meats like deli meats, bacon and sausage since they’re high in fat and sodium, and provide little nutritional value. Instead, try to find healthier alternatives, like turkey or chicken breast, which are lower in fat than bacon or sausage. Avoid ice cream since it’s high in calories and provides few nutrients that are helpful for losing weight.",

If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, you should eat them in moderation. Otherwise, you may not get enough protein, which can lead to muscle loss, particularly while you\\u2019re strength training. You\\u2019ll also be less likely to build muscle, which helps boost your metabolism, the rate at which your body burns calories. Other problematic issues with eating beans and legumes include the fact that they contain oligosaccharides, which are indigestible carbohydrates that can cause gas, and sapiens, which can trigger a insulin response, leading to weight gain.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Beef\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Beef is a great source of protein, but with its high saturated fat content, which is linked to weight gain and cardiovascular disease, it\\u2019s not the best choice for people trying to lose weight.
