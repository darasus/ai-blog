  "summary": "Eating lots of cheese can set you up for weight gain because you’ll be consuming a lot of fat and very few nutrients, which will slow down your weight-loss progress. Avoid processed meats like deli meats, bacon and sausage since they’re high in fat and sodium, and provide little nutritional value. Instead, try to find healthier alternatives, like turkey or chicken breast, which are lower in fat than bacon or sausage. Avoid ice cream since it’s high in calories and provides few nutrients that are helpful for losing weight.",
  "intro": "It’s a well-known fact that the way you eat can have a big impact on how much weight you lose. But what you eat also plays a huge role in how quickly or slowly your weight loss comes off. What you put on your plate is critical because every food has a set amount of calories and specific nutrients — not all foods are created equal. Some foods help you lose weight faster and keep it off, while others have the opposite effect, either because they are high in sugar, fat or calories, or because they have very little nutritional value. \nSuch dietetic staples as broccoli and blueberries are great for losing weight. Other foods like chips and soda? Not so much. Keep reading to learn about the top 10 worst foods to eat if you’re trying to lose weight fast…",
  "content": "## Beans and legumes\n\nBeans and legumes are high in fibre, which is great for weight loss, but they also have a lot of calories and not much protein. If you’re trying to lose weight, you should eat them in moderation. Otherwise, you may not get enough protein, which can lead to muscle loss, particularly while you’re strength training. You’ll also be less likely to build muscle, which helps boost your metabolism, the rate at which your body burns calories. Other problematic issues with eating beans and legumes include the fact that they contain oligosaccharides, which are indigestible carbohydrates that can cause gas, and sapiens, which can trigger a insulin response, leading to weight gain.\n\n## Beef\n\nBeef is a great source of protein, but with its high saturated fat content, which is linked to weight gain and cardiovascular disease, it’s not the best choice for people trying to lose weight. Not to mention that eating a lot of red meat can also increase your risk of colorectal cancer.\nIf you do eat beef, try to eat it in moderation, or better yet, choose lean cuts like flank steak, top loin or sirloin, which contain less than 2 grams of saturated fat per serving. If you prefer ground beef, opt for 96/4, which has less than 2 grams of saturated fat per serving, as well.\n\n## Cheese\n\nAlthough cheese is obviously high in fat, it also has a high amount of calories. Eating lots of cheese can set you up for weight gain because you’ll be consuming a lot of fat and very few nutrients, which will slow down your weight-loss progress.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight and you love cheese, try to eat it in moderation. You can also opt for reduced-fat cheese, which has about half the fat of full-fat cheese.\n\n## Eggs\n\nEggs are a high-quality protein that can help you lose weight, but they also contain a lot of fat and cholesterol. As with cheese, eating too many eggs can lead to weight gain.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should limit yourself to one egg every day. One egg has about 190 calories. If you eat two eggs in a day, you’ll consume 380 calories, whereas three eggs contain 510 calories.\n\n## Hot Dogs\n\nHot dogs are often made with meat and fat, which means they’re high in calories, fat and sodium.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should avoid hot dogs since they’re high in calories and fat. Plus, they contain sodium nitrate, a preservative that may increase your risk of colorectal cancer. Even better, try to replace hot dogs with a healthier option, like an open-faced sandwich on whole grain bread, or scrambled eggs with spinach and tomatoes.\n\n## Ice Cream\n\nIce cream is high in sugar, fat and calories. Plus, it contains very few nutrients that are helpful for losing weight.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should avoid ice cream since it’s high in calories and provides very few nutrients. Instead, try to find a healthier alternative. You can make frozen yogurts at home or buy some low-calorie frozen desserts.\n\n## Processed Meats\n\nProcessed meats like deli meats, bacon and sausage are high in salt and fat, which makes them a bad choice for people who are trying to lose weight.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should avoid processed meats like deli meats, bacon and sausage since they’re high in fat and sodium, and provide little nutritional value. Instead, try to find healthier alternatives, like turkey or chicken breast, which are lower in fat than bacon or sausage.\n\n## Pasta and White Bread\n\nWhite pasta and white bread are high in calories and aren’t good for people who are trying to lose weight. They also contain little protein and fibre.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should limit your intake of pasta and white bread, since they’re high in calories and provide very little nutritional value. Instead, try to find healthier alternatives, like whole-wheat pasta or bread, which are higher in fibre and protein.\n\n## Dried Fruit\n\nDried fruits, particularly raisins, are high in sugar and calories, which means they’re not a good choice for people who are trying to lose weight.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight, you should avoid dried fruits since they’re high in sugar and calories. Plus, they provide very few nutrients that are helpful for losing weight. Instead, try to find healthier alternatives, like apples or bananas, which provide more nutrients like fibre that will help speed up your weight loss.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe most important thing about dieting is that you find a method that works for you. No two people are the same, so what works for your friend may not work for you. With that said, there are some foods that are universally bad for anyone trying to lose weight.\n\nThat being said, there are some foods that are universally good for anyone trying to lose weight. For example, broccoli is packed with fibre, vitamins and minerals, and it’s a great choice for those who are trying to lose weight. With that in mind, it’s important to know the 10 worst foods to eat if you’re trying to lose weight.\n\nThese foods are problematic because they are high in calories, fat or sugar, or they have very little nutritional value. If you’re trying to lose weight, it’s important to avoid these foods."
