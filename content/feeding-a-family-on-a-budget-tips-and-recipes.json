For example, it might feel more expensive to buy vegetables only when they\\u2019re in season; that may not always be the case, but often the non-seasonal price is lower because they are grown more efficiently with fewer inputs on an industrial scale.\nHowever, there are plenty of upsides too!

However you choose to make your own starter, the process is relatively straightforward and once you get the hang of it, an easy routine to keep up.\nSourdough has numerous benefits over other kinds of bread. It is easier for your body to digest than white bread because it doesn\\u2019t have any gluten in it (gluten can be challenging for people with a sensitivity or intolerance).
