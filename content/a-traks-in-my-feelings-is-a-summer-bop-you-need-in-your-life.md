intro: >-
  The Internet has been on fire with talk about the latest dance craze
  sweeping the nation: The Shiggy. Thanks to social media stars like Instagram
  comedian Shiggy, the “In My Feelings” challenge has taken off with a viral
  fervor. But what is it exactly? Is it a dance? A game? An unhinged social
  experiment?

  Perhaps all of these things. Let’s break it down. 

  The “In My Feelings” challenge basically involves someone standing in a public place and dancing along to Drake’s new song, “In My Feelings.” If they are not at home or in their own car, they will have to record this dance and post it online for all their followers to see. It is essentially just an excuse for people to shirk their responsibilities and have fun. Nothing wrong with that!

## What you need to know about the Shiggy

The first thing you need to know about the Shiggy is that it is named after Shiggy. Who is Shiggy? Shiggy is a comedian who found fame on Instagram for his hilarious videos. Shiggy used to be a dancer, and he can still be seen on Instagram dancing with his shirt off.
For this dance craze, people are referring to his viral dance in the “In My Feelings” music video. He is the guy who climbs out of a window, grabs onto a branch and then launches back into the house while Drake raps, “Keke, do you love me?”
The Internet is always up for being silly and having a good laugh, and Shiggy’s hilarious dance is the perfect material for such shenanigans.

## How to do it: The Shiggy Dance Breakdown

The Shiggy dance is actually very simple. All you do is get out of your car and lift up one of your feet while keeping the other planted firmly on the ground. Then, while keeping your head down and your eyes on the planted foot, you hop on your lifted foot. Hop back down. Then hop back up again. It is that simple.
In the “In My Feelings” music video, Shiggy’s dance is actually more complex than that. He does the simple lift-up-one-foot-and-hop-on-the-other-foot move, but he also does some sort of leg flailing that makes the dance a little more hectic.
