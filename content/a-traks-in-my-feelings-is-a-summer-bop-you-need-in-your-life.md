  The Internet has been on fire with talk about the latest dance craze
  sweeping the nation: The Shiggy. Thanks to social media stars like Instagram
  comedian Shiggy, the “In My Feelings” challenge has taken off with a viral
  fervor. But what is it exactly? Is it a dance? A game? An unhinged social
  experiment?

  Perhaps all of these things. Let’s break it down. 

  The “In My Feelings” challenge basically involves someone standing in a public place and dancing along to Drake’s new song, “In My Feelings.” If they are not at home or in their own car, they will have to record this dance and post it online for all their followers to see. It is essentially just an excuse for people to shirk their responsibilities and have fun. Nothing wrong with that!

## How to do it: The Shiggy Dance Breakdown

The Shiggy dance is actually very simple. All you do is get out of your car and lift up one of your feet while keeping the other planted firmly on the ground.

In the “In My Feelings” music video, Shiggy’s dance is actually more complex than that. He does the simple lift-up-one-foot-and-hop-on-the-other-foot move, but he also does some sort of leg flailing that makes the dance a little more hectic.
