intro: >-
  The world is quickly moving towards an age of digital everything. From
  e-books to login IDs, everything is becoming digital. Even things like
  contracts and document management systems are shifting to the cloud and
  becoming more digitized with each passing day. 

  The developers who can adapt to this new world will thrive in it. The ability to read and understand code as well as develop new software is a skill that won’t go out of fashion anytime soon. However, there are plenty of other skills that will be even more valuable in the coming years, such as the ability to use emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).

  Almost everyone has heard about blockchain technology thanks to its usage in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . But what exactly is blockchain technology? A blockchain is a digital ledger that allows users to make secure transactions without the need for a third party or intermediary such as a bank or broker. 

  Let’s take a look at some examples of how you can use blockchain technology for development either now or in the future.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a computer program that can facilitate, verify, and enforce the terms of a contractual agreement. This is a very useful application of blockchain technology, and it’s one that many businesses are starting to use. Using a smart contract, you can create terms and conditions for a client and then have that agreement verified by the blockchain and stored in a distributed ledger. This process makes the entire contractual process more secure and transparent while also cutting down on the time and cost of traditional contracting. These smart contracts can also help you to create decentralized apps (DApps). 
In fact, we’ve already seen them in action. For example, both the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the token for the decentralized exchange called Etherex have been built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and utilise smart contracts in their functionalities. In the future, we’ll almost certainly see even more businesses and organizations use smart contracts as this technology improves and becomes more accessible to a wider range of people.

## Decentralized Cloud Storage

A decentralized cloud storage system is one where the data is distributed across a network of computers, usually in different geographical locations. This means that no one entity has control over your data, and they can’t deny you access to it either. It’s a concept that’s core to blockchain technology, and you can use it to create a decentralized storage system that allows people to store information in a secure, encrypted fashion. Some decentralized storage systems are also open source, which means that anyone can make changes to the code and improve the system. This is something that you could build into your decentralized cloud storage system to make it even more secure and robust. If you’re developing a decentralized file storage solution, it’s worth considering a system that’s based on blockchain technology. This can offer you a high level of security, and many decentralized storage systems are also peer-to-peer networks, which means they are completely decentralized and don’t rely on a single server or computer. This makes them highly resilient against attacks and disruptions.

## KYC and Identity Verification

KYC, or know your customer, is a process that companies use to identify their customers and make sure they are who they say they are. It’s also a useful process that’s used by law enforcement to track criminals. With blockchain technology, you can create a decentralized network that allows people to securely verify their identity. This network could be used by companies conducting KYC checks or by governments who need to track criminals and terrorists. If you’re creating an identity verification system based around blockchain technology, it’s important to consider the privacy of the users. After all, you want people to feel safe verifying their identity, but also be aware of the security risks involved. You should also think about how to make the system as user friendly as possible, as a complicated process could deter people from using your system and defeating the whole point of creating it in the first place.

## Supply Chain Management

If you’re looking to create a decentralized supply chain management platform using blockchain technology, you need to consider each stage of the process and whether it’s suitable for decentralization. For example, it’s not really viable to track the transportation of goods through a decentralized network. However, once goods have reached their destination, it’s possible to track them through this decentralized network to make the entire shipping process more transparent and secure. You can also use this decentralized network to track and record the origin of products such as food thanks to blockchain technology’s ability to store data and verify each item through a digital fingerprint. This could help to eliminate the presence of fraudulent goods and be a real boon for people who are trying to avoid certain products due to allergies or other reasons.

## AI Development with Machine Learning

One of the most exciting areas of blockchain technology is how it’s being used to improve machine learning and artificial intelligence. By combining these two fields, you can create more powerful algorithms and more sophisticated pieces of software. Already, companies like SingularityNET and Endor are creating decentralized networks that allow people to create their own algorithms and use them to solve problems. It’s a system that allows businesses to outsource some of their AI needs, which can help to make the technology more affordable and accessible. These decentralized AI networks also make the system more secure, as there is no single point of failure. If you’re interested in using blockchain technology to develop AI, it’s important to know that the technology is still new and unproven in many respects. However, it has the potential to completely transform the AI landscape, making it faster and more powerful than it has ever been before.

## Conclusion

With blockchain technology and its decentralized network structure, information can be transmitted safely and securely. This is especially important when it comes to financial information, such as when initiating a payment or sending money from one person to another.

As you can see, there are a wide range of ways that you can use blockchain technology for development. Whether you want to create decentralized networks or decentralized storage systems, the technology is there for you to use. With blockchain technology becoming more popular, it’s also likely that developers will be in high demand in the coming years.
