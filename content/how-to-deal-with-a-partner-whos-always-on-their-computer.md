It can be difficult to deal with a partner who's always on their computer, especially if you feel like you're being ignored. Here are a few tips to help you deal with the situation:

1. Talk to your partner about how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your feelings to your partner so they can understand how their behavior is affecting you.

2. Try to find common ground. If you can find activities that you both enjoy, it will help you to connect with your partner on a deeper level.

3. Be patient. It takes time to build trust and intimacy, so don't expect things to change overnight.

4. Seek professional help if needed. If you're struggling to communicate with your partner, or if the situation is causing you distress, it may be helpful to seek professional counseling.
