Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive. However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIf you\\u2019re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI. Additionally, we\\u2019ll explore some common applications of Go for AI and video processing as well as provide examples of programs written in Go that can be used by you if you want to get started sooner rather than later!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems. The latest technology being adopted by both enterprises and developers is the Internet of Things (IoT).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
