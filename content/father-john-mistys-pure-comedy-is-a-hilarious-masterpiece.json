The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Everyone has their own idea of what is and isn\\u2019t humorous in music, and honestly, that\\u2019s what makes it great. With that in mind, we want to start by saying that Pure Comedy is an album full of hilarious moments. There are a lot of ridiculous scenarios painted throughout this record, many of which are undoubtedly hilarious in their absurdity.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"That being said, we think the most humorous aspect of Pure Comedy is the fact that Tillman named the album Pure Comedy. The title is just so ridiculous and over-the-top; it\\u2019s the comedic equivalent of naming a movie The Greatest Film Ever Made. The album title is such a bold statement that it again serves as a perfect introduction to this record. It\\u2019s so silly and over-the-top that it\\u2019s impossible not to laugh.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Art of Idling\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Throughout the record, Tillman is also critical of the way people spend their time. While the tracklist paints a picture of the human race as a group of anxious, fearful beings, the music itself is often quite soothing. Most of the songs are soft and easy-going, almost like a lullaby. We\\u2019re not saying that lulling oneself to sleep is a bad thing, but there\\u2019s also nothing particularly productive about simply idling away one\\u2019s time.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There\\u2019s also a strong element of irony to the way Pure Comedy is constructed. The record is almost 50 minutes long and features 16 tracks, so it\\u2019s definitely not short. Yet, many of these songs are rather easy-going and lack the intensity one might expect from a record this long. In this way, the album almost feels like a satire of the way pop music is constructed.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Hangout at the End of the World\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Humans are an anxious bunch, and a large part of that anxiety stems from the way we consume our news. We\\u2019re constantly being fed information about what is happening in the world and being asked to react to it, but what if we don\\u2019t have the time or energy to process it all? What if we\\u2019re just too busy dealing with our own personal problems to care about the next election or refugee crisis?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This is the sentiment explored in Hangout at the End of the World. It\\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek song that uses some exaggerated imagery to explore the idea that we all just need to calm down and relax a bit. It\\u2019s a message that is as relevant today as it was when the song was written.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Just a Normal Day\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"On the other end of the spectrum, Just a Normal Day is a satirical take on the idealistic way we view our lives. We often look back on past days and wish we could be living in that moment again, but the truth is that most days are normal and average.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The lyrics to Just a Normal Day paint a picture of a day that is so ordinary, so normal, that it\\u2019s almost boring. On paper, it\\u2019s not a particularly interesting or special day, but Tillman makes us wish we could experience it for ourselves. He makes us wish we could have a day that is so mundane and normal because there\\u2019s nothing better than a normal day.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Lonely-Ass Eden\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While the tracklist of Pure Comedy is littered with humorous moments, there are also a lot of serious themes explored here. People are not just idling away their time; they\\u2019re also consumed with fear and anxiety. There are a lot of serious moments throughout the album, and one of the most poignant is Lonely-Ass Eden.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This is the sort of song that is as much about what is said as it is about what is not said. There are a lot of general statements and vague references made, but there\\u2019s also a distinct lack of specifics. This song is as much about what it doesn\\u2019t say as it is about what it does say, and we think that\\u2019s very clever.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"When the Comedy\\u2019s Over\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Finally, Tillman ends the record with the track When the Comedy\\u2019s Over, which is perhaps the darkest moment on the album. This song talks about the way we perceive the universe and how we\\u2019re all trapped in our own bubbles. It\\u2019s a cynical take on the universe that again uses imagery that is both funny and a bit frightening.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This song is definitely the most dramatic moment on Pure Comedy, and it\\u2019s a great way to wrap up the record. It\\u2019s both humorous and chilling, and it perfectly captures the tone of the album as a whole.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"To put it simply, Father John Misty\\u2019s new record, Pure Comedy, is a hilarious masterpiece. It\\u2019s a record that manages to be funny and depressing all at once, which is a really difficult thing to do. The album is beautifully constructed and masterfully written, and it\\u2019s an easy contender for the best album of 2017. If you\\u2019re not laughing, you\\u2019re probably crying, and that\\u2019s precisely the effect Father John Misty intended.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Maybe it\\u2019s the pressure to impress both new listeners and old fans, or simply the natural progression of any band that leaves them feeling eager to experiment. Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
