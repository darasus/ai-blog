The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Everyone has their own idea of what is and isn\\u2019t humorous in music, and honestly, that\\u2019s what makes it great. With that in mind, we want to start by saying that Pure Comedy is an album full of hilarious moments. There are a lot of ridiculous scenarios painted throughout this record, many of which are undoubtedly hilarious in their absurdity.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"That being said, we think the most humorous aspect of Pure Comedy is the fact that Tillman named the album Pure Comedy. The title is just so ridiculous and over-the-top; it\\u2019s the comedic equivalent of naming a movie The Greatest Film Ever Made. The album title is such a bold statement that it again serves as a perfect introduction to this record. It\\u2019s so silly and over-the-top that it\\u2019s impossible not to laugh.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Art of Idling\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Throughout the record, Tillman is also critical of the way people spend their time. While the tracklist paints a picture of the human race as a group of anxious, fearful beings, the music itself is often quite soothing. Most of the songs are soft and easy-going, almost like a lullaby. We\\u2019re not saying that lulling oneself to sleep is a bad thing, but there\\u2019s also nothing particularly productive about simply idling away one\\u2019s time.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There\\u2019s also a strong element of irony to the way Pure Comedy is constructed. The record is almost 50 minutes long and features 16 tracks, so it\\u2019s definitely not short. Yet, many of these songs are rather easy-going and lack the intensity one might expect from a record this long. In this way, the album almost feels like a satire of the way pop music is constructed.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Hangout at the End of the World\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Humans are an anxious bunch, and a large part of that anxiety stems from the way we consume our news. We\\u2019re constantly being fed information about what is happening in the world and being asked to react to it, but what if we don\\u2019t have the time or energy to process it all? What if we\\u2019re just too busy dealing with our own personal problems to care about the next election or refugee crisis?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This is the sentiment explored in Hangout at the End of the World. It\\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek song that uses some exaggerated imagery to explore the idea that we all just need to calm down and relax a bit. It\\u2019s a message that is as relevant today as it was when the song was written.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Just a Normal Day\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"On the other end of the spectrum, Just a Normal Day is a satirical take on the idealistic way we view our lives. We often look back on past days and wish we could be living in that moment again, but the truth is that most days are normal and average.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The lyrics to Just a Normal Day paint a picture of a day that is so ordinary, so normal, that it\\u2019s almost boring. On paper, it\\u2019s not a particularly interesting or special day, but Tillman makes us wish we could experience it for ourselves.

There are a lot of serious moments throughout the album, and one of the most poignant is Lonely-Ass Eden.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This is the sort of song that is as much about what is said as it is about what is not said. There are a lot of general statements and vague references made, but there\\u2019s also a distinct lack of specifics. This song is as much about what it doesn\\u2019t say as it is about what it does say, and we think that\\u2019s very clever.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"When the Comedy\\u2019s Over\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Finally, Tillman ends the record with the track When the Comedy\\u2019s Over, which is perhaps the darkest moment on the album. This song talks about the way we perceive the universe and how we\\u2019re all trapped in our own bubbles. It\\u2019s a cynical take on the universe that again uses imagery that is both funny and a bit frightening.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This song is definitely the most dramatic moment on Pure Comedy, and it\\u2019s a great way to wrap up the record. It\\u2019s both humorous and chilling, and it perfectly captures the tone of the album as a whole.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"To put it simply, Father John Misty\\u2019s new record, Pure Comedy, is a hilarious masterpiece. It\\u2019s a record that manages to be funny and depressing all at once, which is a really difficult thing to do. The album is beautifully constructed and masterfully written, and it\\u2019s an easy contender for the best album of 2017. If you\\u2019re not laughing, you\\u2019re probably crying, and that\\u2019s precisely the effect Father John Misty intended.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

He would go on to become a war hero, pioneer of computer science, and one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
