  "summary": "Pure Comedy is almost 50 minutes long and features 16 tracks. Most of the songs are soft and easy-going, almost like a lullaby. The album title is such a bold statement that it serves as a perfect introduction to the record. There are a lot of serious moments throughout the album, and one of the most poignant is Lonely-Ass Eden. The darkest moment is When the Comedyâ€™s Over, which is perhaps the darkest moment on the album. It is both humorous and chilling and perfectly captures the tone of the album as well as the tone.",

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Everyone has their own idea of what is and isn\\u2019t humorous in music, and honestly, that\\u2019s what makes it great. With that in mind, we want to start by saying that Pure Comedy is an album full of hilarious moments. There are a lot of ridiculous scenarios painted throughout this record, many of which are undoubtedly hilarious in their absurdity.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"That being said, we think the most humorous aspect of Pure Comedy is the fact that Tillman named the album Pure Comedy. The title is just so ridiculous and over-the-top; it\\u2019s the comedic equivalent of naming a movie The Greatest Film Ever Made.

Most of the songs are soft and easy-going, almost like a lullaby.

The record is almost 50 minutes long and features 16 tracks, so it\\u2019s definitely not short.

It\\u2019s a record that manages to be funny and depressing all at once, which is a really difficult thing to do. The album is beautifully constructed and masterfully written, and it\\u2019s an easy contender for the best album of 2017.

Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.
