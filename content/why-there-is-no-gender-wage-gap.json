  "title": "Why There Is No Gender Wage Gap",
  "summary": "The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees with regard to the amount of compensation they receive based on their gender. Despite good intentions, the law hasn’t actually done much to correct the issue of unequal compensation for equal work. Despite the fact that more women are entering traditionally male-dominated industries, the wage gap between men and women is actually shrinking. Women are more likely to work in lower-paying industries, like the education and health care fields, and women tend to be less willing to negotiate for higher pay.",
  "intro": "According to a report from the American Council of Education, women are fast becoming the dominant presence in U.S. colleges and universities. Women now account for nearly two-thirds of all students enrolling in postsecondary education, and that number is only growing.\nIn light of this increased access to education among women, it’s no surprise that more and more women are moving into professions once dominated by men. The unfortunate consequence is that we are now seeing widespread misrepresentation of facts related to gender wage gaps, particularly when it comes to the so-called “gender wage gap” as it applies to compensation for work done by men versus women.\nIf you read or listen to much mainstream media coverage on this topic, you would likely come away with the belief that there is a veritable conspiracy among employers to pay women less than men for doing the same job because of their gender.",
  "content": "## What Is The Gender Wage Gap?\n\nThe gender wage gap is a measure of the average difference between the wages earned by men and women over the course of a year, calculated based on hourly or yearly earnings (whichever is greater).\nThe key word in the above definition, however, is average. What we’re talking about when we say there is a gender wage gap is not that women are paid less than men for the same jobs. Rather, it’s that men and women tend to work in different occupations and industries, and that women are more likely to work part-time, which explains the bulk of the gender wage gap.\n\n## Why Doesn’t Equal Pay For Equal Work Already Exist?\n\nThe Equal Pay Act of 1963 was meant to put an end to all of this. The principle behind the law was simple: If two people perform equal work in the same workplace for the same employer, then they should earn equal pay, regardless of their gender.\nThe problem is that, despite good intentions from the lawmakers who created the law and the fact that it is still on the books, the Equal Pay Act hasn’t actually done much to correct the issue of unequal compensation for equal work.\nWhy is that? Well, the problem is that for the most part, this law is unenforceable.\nTo understand why this is, we need to take a look at the law’s language.\n\n## Why There Is No Wage Gap Due To Gender Bias\n\nThe Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees with regard to the amount of compensation they receive based on their gender. In other words, if a man and a woman work in the same position, they should receive the same pay.\nWhat’s key here is the phrase “based on their gender.” The point of the Equal Pay Act is not to ensure that men and women in the same company are compensated equally for the same job with the same skill level and effort required.\n\n## Why There Is No Wage Gap Due To Women’s Career Choices\n\nThere may be some differences in pay between men and women, but there are also plenty of factors that have nothing to do with gender bias. For example, women are more likely to work part-time, which tends to lead to lower overall earnings, compared to men who are more likely to work full-time. Women are also more likely to work in lower-paying industries, like the education and health care fields.\nAdditionally, some studies have shown that women tend to be less willing to negotiate for higher pay, which could affect the amount of money they earn over the course of their careers.\nThese are just a few examples of how men and women’s career choices lead to different levels of compensation, and none of them have anything to do with gender discrimination.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe reality is that, despite the fact that more women are entering traditionally male-dominated industries, the wage gap between men and women is actually shrinking, not growing.\n\nThis shrinking of the wage gap can be attributed to a number of factors, including an increase in women’s educational attainment, more women entering traditionally male-dominated occupations, and an increase in women’s participation in the workforce.\n\nWith more women in the workforce, the average salary for all workers is likely to increase, and the wage gap will continue to decrease as a result."
