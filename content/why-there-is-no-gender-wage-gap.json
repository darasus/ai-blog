  "summary": "The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees with regard to the amount of compensation they receive based on their gender. Despite good intentions, the law hasnâ€™t actually done much to correct the issue of unequal compensation for equal work. Despite the fact that more women are entering traditionally male-dominated industries, the wage gap between men and women is actually shrinking. Women are more likely to work in lower-paying industries, like the education and health care fields, and women tend to be less willing to negotiate for higher pay.",
