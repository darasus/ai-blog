The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.\nMediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there\\u2019s no clear right or wrong side or when it\\u2019s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is also a less expensive, private and confidential process that can help the parties reach an agreement quickly. While mediation works best when both parties are willing to negotiate and compromise, it does not always work out that way in real life. Some cases require the help of a neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution process.
