intro: >-
  Getting the flu or a cold is inevitable. In fact, you could get sick
  around this time every year without fail. The only thing you can do is take
  precautions and try to avoid catching a bug in the first place. However, even
  with good intentions and best efforts, the odds are stacked against you. These
  viruses are so common that virtually everyone has been exposed to them at some
  point in their lives, generally during childhood. 

  Thankfully there are ways to reduce your risk of contracting these viruses and being able to recover quickly if they manage to sneak through your defenses. Cold and flu season brings with it stressors like school, work, family obligations and end-of-year deadlinesâ€”not exactly ideal conditions for keeping your immune system strong!

## Stay hydrated

Keeping your body hydrated is key to staying healthy. Flu and cold viruses are super sneaky and will use your body's defenses against you. If your body doesn't have enough water, your immune system won't function optimally and you'll be more susceptible to infections. One of the best ways to make sure you're staying hydrated is to drink water out of a straw. While you should be drinking 3-4 litres of water a day, it's easy to forget to do so when you're super busy with work and life in general. Drinking water out of a straw ensures that you're staying hydrated throughout the day and helping minimize the risk of getting sick.

Another way to make sure you're staying hydrated is to change your water filter. If you're living in an area with poor water quality, contaminants like chlorine can build up in your water filter, making it less effective at filtering out bacteria and keeping your water clean. When your water filter isn't working at its best, you might not be getting the amount of water you need to stay hydrated and healthy.

## Get enough sleep

Another crucial part of staying healthy is getting enough sleep. When you get enough sleep, you help boost your immunity and your body's ability to fight off infection.
If you're not getting enough sleep, your immune system will be weakened, your risk of chronic diseases will be increased and you'll feel more stressed and have a harder time focusing.

If you're a student and find yourself struggling to get enough sleep, there are some things you can do to help. For example, you can set a bedtime and try to stick to it, avoid eating heavy meals late at night, and make sure your room has optimal sleeping conditions (i.e. dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature).

## Wash your hands often

This one might seem obvious but it's worth mentioning that you should wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face. When you're out and about, use hand sanitizer if there aren't any paper towels near you.
When you're home, you should wash your hands more often than just after you go to the bathroom. You should wash your hands after you cough or sneeze, after you change your child's diaper (or clean up after your pet), after you prepare food and before you touch any food that isn't pre-packaged.

Avoid touching your face as much as possible, as this is how cold and flu viruses are usually passed from person to person. Be mindful when you're out and about and be sure not to touch other people, especially if you're sick. If you do have to touch someone, make sure to wash your hands afterwards.

## Don't touch your face

This might come as a surprise but you should avoid touching your face as much as possible. When you touch your face, you transfer all kinds of yucky germs from your hands, the door handle at work, or the subway pole onto your face.
When you touch your face, you transfer those germs onto your mucus membranes, which are the areas inside your nose, mouth, and eyelids. Those areas are much more sensitive than your hand and are more likely to become infected if they come into contact with a bacteria or virus.

## Exercise regularly

Exercising regularly helps keep your immune system strong, which helps you stay healthy when cold and flu season rolls around.
Exercising at least three times per week can help improve your immune system, boost endorphins and make you feel more relaxed and less stressed. Regular exercise also helps reduce your risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancers.

Exercising regularly doesn't have to mean taking a spin class or going for a run. You can incorporate exercise into your daily routine as you're doing other things. For example, you can walk or bike to work, take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or do yard work when it's nice out, or do some stretching exercises while watching TV.

## Boost your immune system

There are certain foods that can help you boost your immune system and keep flu and cold viruses at bay.
These include vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene, zinc and iron.
These are all powerful antioxidants that help boost your immune system and keep your body healthy. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits such as oranges, broccoli and bell peppers, while iron is found in lentils, broccoli and vitamin E is found in nuts and seeds.

There are other things you can do to help boost your immune system such as getting enough sleep, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods rich in vitamins and minerals.

## Conclusion

Cold and flu season is an opportunity to practice good self-care and self-love. You might not be able to control when someone sneezes on you or if you accidentally touch something germy. What you can control is your reaction to those situations and how you respond to your body.

If you follow these tips, you should hopefully be able to avoid cold and flu season and be able to recover quickly if you do get sick. Stay hydrated, get enough sleep, wash your hands often, avoid touching your face and try to boost your immune system by eating healthy foods and getting enough vitamins and minerals.
