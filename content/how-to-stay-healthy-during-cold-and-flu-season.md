The best way to stay healthy during cold and flu season is to take some simple precautions. First, wash your hands regularly and often. This will help to remove any germs that you may have come in contact with. Second, avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you must be around someone who is sick, try to keep a distance of at least six feet. Third, clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched, such as door handles, countertops, and light switches. Fourth, stay away from sick people, and if you are sick, stay home from work or school. Fifth, cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough, and wash your hands afterwards. Sixth, get the flu vaccine. This is the best way to protect yourself from the flu. Seventh, if you do get sick, take care of yourself and see a doctor if your symptoms are severe.
