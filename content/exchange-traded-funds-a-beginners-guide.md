## What is an ETF?

An ETF is a type of fund that holds assets such as stocks, bonds, or other securities and trades on a stock exchange at any time during the day. The price of ETF shares will change throughout the day as the value of the underlying assets in the fund fluctuate. ETFs can be passively managed or actively managed. Passive ETFs track an index, which means the fund's holdings are selected to match the composition of a specific index.
Most ETFs are passively managed, which means they track a specific benchmark, like an index. It’s important to understand, though, that ETFs come in many different varieties and can be used to get exposure to a variety of different assets. They can be used to gain exposure to certain industries, geographical regions, or asset classes, such as stocks or bonds. 
## Understanding asset classes

An asset class is a group of securities that have similar risk and return characteristics. The two main types of assets are stocks and bonds.
The equity risk-return trade-off is the risk that comes with investing in stocks. The higher the expected return on a stock, the higher the risk that it may go down in value.
Bonds are loans that are issued by governments or companies with a promise to pay the holder regularly and with interest.
The return on these types of investments is lower than what you would get from stocks, but the risk is also significantly lower.
Bonds have a duration, which is the length of time it will take for the bond’s owner to get their original investment back.
Most people invest in a mix of these two types of assets because no single asset class is a surefire way to make money.

## Benefits of investing in ETFs

ETFs provide you with diversification – You can gain exposure to many different assets and industries through ETFs, which means your investment is less susceptible to risk.

ETFs are cheap to buy and easy to manage – ETFs have low management fees, and many can be purchased through a brokerage account with no trading fees.

ETFs are transparent – All ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis.

ETFs are liquid – ETFs can easily be bought or sold at any time during the day because they trade on stock exchanges.

ETFs are transparent – All ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis.

ETFs offer tax efficiency – ETFs are designed to minimize taxes through regular distributions of profits by the fund and by holding securities that produce low capital gains.

## Types of ETFs

You can invest in ETFs using different strategies, such as a growth or value equity strategy. You can also invest in ETFs that track specific sectors or industries.

There are also ETFs that use derivatives to generate an equity-like return. These so-called synthetic ETFs are based on futures contracts, which are contracts to buy an asset at a certain price on a certain date.

A leveraged ETF that uses derivatives will have a multiplier that magnifies the return of the underlying index, such as 2x or 3x. This means the ETF will have a higher expected return compared to an ETF that doesn’t have this option. But because it’s magnifying the return, it also magnifies the risk.

## How to buy and sell ETFs

First, decide how much money you want to invest in ETFs. Then, pick the ETFs you want to invest in. If you use a robo-advisor service to manage your money, they’ll likely have a large selection of ETFs to choose from. 

Once you’ve decided on which ETFs to invest in, open an account with a broker, such as Charles Schwab, and transfer money into it. You can then buy ETFs through the broker. When you’re ready to sell, you can do so through the same broker.

## Things to be aware of when investing in ETFs

ETFs don’t come with guarantees, so you’re taking on additional risk – There are no guarantees that the ETFs in which you’ve invested will perform well. The risk of investing in any type of ETF is that the underlying assets could go down in value.

ETFs are subject to taxes – While ETFs are designed to minimize taxes through regular distributions of profits by the fund and by holding securities that produce low capital gains, they’re still subject to taxes.

ETFs are not a one-size-fits-all investment – No investment is a surefire way to make money. While ETFs are generally a safe way to invest your money, they’re not a guaranteed way to make a profit.

## Bottom line

While investing in ETFs doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to make money, they are a generally safe and easy way to invest your money and gain exposure to various asset classes.

You can select from a wide variety of ETFs to invest in, ranging from those that hold stocks to those that hold bonds or commodities like gold.

If you’re looking for a relatively low-risk way to grow your money, ETFs are a great option.
