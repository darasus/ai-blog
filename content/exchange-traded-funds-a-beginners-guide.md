An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that tracks a basket of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or a combination of these. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, and they can be bought and sold like stocks.

ETFs are popular because they offer the potential for higher returns than traditional investments, such as mutual funds, and they are often more tax-efficient. ETFs also provide investors with the ability to gain exposure to a wide variety of asset classes and sectors in a single investment.

There are many different types of ETFs available, so it's important to understand how they work before investing. This beginner's guide will explain what ETFs are, how they work, and the pros and cons of investing in them.

How do ETFs work?

An ETF tracks a basket of assets, which can include stocks, bonds, commodities, or a combination of these. The fund is managed by an investment team, who aim to track the performance of the underlying assets.

ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, and they can be bought and sold like stocks. The price of an ETF is based on the value of the underlying assets it tracks. For example, if an ETF tracks a basket of stocks, the price of the ETF will rise and fall as the value of the stocks in the basket rise and fall.

Investors can buy and sell ETFs through a broker. Some brokers offer commission-free trading for ETFs.
