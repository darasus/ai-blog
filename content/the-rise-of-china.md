  recovered. Nowhere is this more apparent than today. 

  For the past few centuries, China has slowly but surely been climbing back from a period of relative obscurity. Today, it is once again one of the most powerful countries on Earth, with an economy larger than that of India and a population bigger than any other country except for India and Nigeria. Moreover, as numerous industry analysts and experts predict even further growth in the coming decades. So what exactly has led to this massive resurgence?

## A brief history of China

China is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, with records of civilization going back over 4,000 years. The first civilization to emerge in East Asia, it soon became a vibrant and powerful civilization with an immense cultural influence.
The first time that China was recognized as a global superpower was during the Han Dynasty, which existed from 206 BC to 220 AD. It was during this time that the Silk Road was established and trade flourished between the East and West. The Roman Empire also imported large amounts of Chinese silk, whereas the Chinese imported glass, jewelry, wine, and spices from the Romans.
During the Middle Ages, China was ruled by the Mongols, whose empire stretched from Central Asia to the Mediterranean Sea. After their rule ended, China was ruled by the Ming Dynasty. It was during this time that China became the most advanced civilization in the world, with trade routes and goods extending all across Asia.

## Reasons for China's rise

China’s ascent to the top of the world has been gradual and extraordinarily steady. In the last 100 years, it has experienced two major wars, widespread economic transformation, political revolution, and massive population growth. During this time, other countries have seen their power ebb and flow in cycles of growth and decline. Unlike many other nations, China has seen a steady climb toward dominance.
During the 20th century, China was the site of two brutal wars. The First Sino-Japanese War ended in 1895 with Japanese control of the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Chinese island of Hainan. The Second Sino-Japanese War, which began in 1937, lasted nearly 10 years, was fought on Chinese soil, and ended with Japan’s occupation of China.
Yet this sequence of violent conflicts ended in Chinese victory and Japan’s withdrawal from Chinese territory. China also emerged from the Second World War as one of the most populous countries in the world.
In the 1950s, China’s economy was rapidly transforming from a primarily agricultural state to an industrialized one. The breakneck pace of economic change led to the Great Chinese Famine, which began in 1959 and killed between 15 million and 45 million Chinese people.

## Rapid Industrialization

It might seem counterintuitive that rapid industrialization would be one of the reasons for China’s ascent, but it is crucial to understanding the context of China’s economic rise.
In the 1950s and 1960s, China’s economy was primarily agricultural and depended on the production of food. In order to break free from this model, the Chinese government implemented the Great Leap Forward, a campaign of economic development and rapid industrialization.
In the span of just a few years, China transformed from a largely agrarian economy to an industrialized one. To facilitate this change, the Chinese government required its people to produce steel for household utensils, instead of purchasing them from other countries.
This massive push for industrialization led to widespread famine, death from malnutrition, and even the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-1961. Nevertheless, it also resulted in China becoming an industrialized country.

## Military strength

China’s military strength today is a major source of its strength as a whole. Its military is the second-largest in the world, after the U.S., and one of only a handful that can be confidently described as a superpower.
The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is a massive force, with more than 2.3 million active personnel, and about 8.25 million in total. The Chinese military has seen extensive modernization in the past few decades and boasts a substantial amount of high-tech weaponry.
The Chinese military’s enormous size also gives it significant sway over international affairs. The Chinese military has been involved in a number of territorial disputes around China’s borders, including the Spratly Islands, the South China Sea, and Taiwan.

## Cultural influence

China’s rise to prominence is also due to its immense cultural influence. Chinese culture is one of the oldest and most enduring in the world, and has been influential for thousands of years.
The Chinese language is one of the most widely spoken in the world, with approximately 1.2 billion native speakers. This means that many of the world’s other major languages have borrowed heavily from Chinese.
Chinese culture permeates many other countries as well, with Chinese food being consumed around the world and Chinese martial arts being practiced in many places outside of China.

## Conclusion

China’s influence is evident not only in raw economic statistics, but in its global impact as well. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping has emerged as a leader in the fight against climate change, using his country’s massive economic power to advocate for a reduction in carbon emissions.
China has also been a major player in international trade for many decades, but now has the potential to expand significantly due to its Belt and Road Initiative, a massive investment project intended to increase trade throughout Eurasia.

If you’re a business owner then having a clear idea of the factors that are driving the Chinese market forward is essential. It will help you to plan your business strategy better and make better business decisions.
