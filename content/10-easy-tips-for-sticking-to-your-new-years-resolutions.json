Start by shifting your daily routine, especially if you\\u2019re a person who is stuck in a daily routine that doesn\\u2019t support your New Year\\u2019s resolutions. If you\\u2019re trying to eat healthier, you might want to consider a different grocery store or a different route home from work that gives you a different perspective. If you\\u2019re trying to reduce stress and anxiety, you might want to change where you go to unwind and relax. If you go to the same place every day, you\\u2019ll likely get used to it and it won\\u2019t have the same effect. If you\\u2019re trying to exercise more, you might want to consider a different time or day of the week. If you usually work out on a Wednesday night, try switching to a Saturday morning. If you\\u2019re trying to learn a new skill, you might want to find a new place to practice \\u2014 like a new coffee shop or library.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Write down your reasons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This works well for resolutions that are more about personal growth and self-awareness.

If you\\u2019re trying to help others more, write down why doing so is important to you. If you\\u2019re trying to be more creative, write down how creativity makes you feel. If you\\u2019re trying to spend more time with loved ones, write down how those relationships make you feel.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Make it a habit\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are many common New Year\\u2019s resolutions with a focus on habit-building, like exercising more, eating healthier, reading more or learning new skills. Those are great to focus on, but they can also be overwhelming. It\\u2019s better to look at one habit at a time and make it a part of your daily routine. Once you have that down, you can add another habit. If you try to do too much at once, it\\u2019s likely you will burn out and give up. Starting small and building up slowly is a better way to go about it. If you\\u2019re trying to read more, don\\u2019t go from reading zero books a year to 12 books a month. Start with one book a month and build up from there. If you\\u2019re trying to eat healthier, start by making one small change \\u2014 like switching from white bread to whole grain bread or drinking more water. Then add a second change, and so on.

If you\\u2019re trying to eat healthier, don\\u2019t expect to change your eating habits overnight. It takes time and patience to change your eating habits for the better.
