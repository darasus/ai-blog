summary: "The future of work will be more connected and collaborative than ever
  before, with new ways to work and new tools that make it easier to get things
  done together. People will work more flexibly, with more control over how and
  when they work, and we’ll see more diversity: with more people working
  remotely and more people of different ages and backgrounds collaborating
  together. Future of work is likely to see the rise of automation and robotics,
  as machines are designed to perform more human tasks and take over the jobs
  that are either dangerous or that people don't want to do."
intro: Today, most people visit their desk just two or three days a week,
  spending the rest of the time working virtually from anywhere. The rise in
  telecommuting has transformed workplaces by enabling employees to work from
  home and eliminating the need to commute. But it’s also meant that the role of
  work is changing faster than ever before. The future of work is changing fast
  too. As we enter into the digital age, there are new opportunities and
  challenges for jobs as we know them today. New jobs are being created, some
  old ones are disappearing, and many more will be influenced by technology in
  years to come. How will different industries adapt? What skills will be
  required in 10 years’ time? And what implications does this have for education
  today?

## What Will The Future Of Work Look Like?

We know that the future of work will be more connected and collaborative than ever before, with new ways to work and new tools that make it easier to get things done together. In the future, the way you work will be more personalized, with more focus on total wellbeing and less on sitting in an office from 9 to 5. People will work more flexibly, with more control over how and when they work. And we’ll see more diversity: with more people working remotely and more people of different ages and backgrounds collaborating together. The future of work will be more empowered, more automated, and more socially driven than ever before.

These trends will create new opportunities for people to do meaningful work, find greater fulfillment in their jobs, and be more productive than ever before. There will be new ways to find work and new ways to work together that we can’t even imagine today. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and Blockchain will redefine how we work. Human connection and empathy will be at the heart of the future of work — and people will be empowered to do their best work by bringing their whole selves to the job.

## A world with no more 9-to-5 jobs

As work becomes more distributed, we’ll move further away from the idea of “9 to 5” jobs —and we’ll see fewer people in full-time roles. Recent data shows that the number of freelancers worldwide is expected to rise to more than 58% of the total workforce by the year 2030. Plus, almost one in three workers are already employed in a freelance capacity. Whether it’s because they prefer flexibility or they’re unable to find a traditional job, this shift is already underway — and it’s gaining momentum. The concept of 9-to-5 work is already outdated. And every industry will need to adapt to this new way of working. Companies that fail to adapt to these new ways of working will not survive.

## Job automation and robotics

The future of work is likely to see the rise of automation and robotics, as machines are designed to perform more human tasks and take over the jobs that are either dangerous or that people don’t want to do. But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, automation could potentially have a positive effect on the workplace. Automated job procedures can be quicker, more consistent, and more accurate than human workers. And people can then focus on higher-value tasks that require critical thinking or creativity. There’s no doubt that automation will take over some of the roles we currently think of as “jobs.” But the rise of automation will also create new jobs and opportunities. For example, engineers and manufacturers will need to create new kinds of robots and systems to automate their processes. And there will be more opportunities to focus on designing and managing automation systems. In some cases, automation may actually create more jobs than it takes away. For example, a data centre that replaces its human workers with robots would need to hire people to maintain the robots and repair them when they break down.

## The rise of the freelance economy

With an increased focus on freelance work, there will be an even greater demand for “location-independent” jobs. Remote work is an ongoing trend that’s expected to increase as more people choose to work from home and as technology makes it easier to collaborate and work from anywhere. This is creating a shift towards more flexible work arrangements and a “location-independent” workforce. This benefits both the employer and the employee: it allows people to focus on their work, and it gives them flexibility to manage their time and find a work-life balance. The rise of the freelance economy will also impact industries that traditionally have hired full-time employees, such as the healthcare sector. As technology enables more remote work, people could see a shift away from 9-to-5 jobs and towards 24/7 work. This could create challenges for industries that are used to having a consistent work schedule, but it could also open up new opportunities for people who prefer to work remotely.

## More remote workers

The way people work is likely to change even more as we move towards an even more “distributed” workforce. Telecommuting, working from home, is an ongoing trend that’s expected to increase as more people choose to work remotely and as technology makes it easier to collaborate and work from anywhere. This is creating a shift towards more flexible work arrangements and a “distributed” workforce. This benefits both the employer and the employee: it allows people to focus on their work, and it gives them flexibility to manage their time and find a work-life balance. Working remotely doesn’t just apply to “white collar” jobs, either. With new technologies like VR and AR helping people collaborate remotely, there are more opportunities than ever before to work from home or remotely.

## Improving employee wellbeing

As work becomes more distributed, companies will have to shift away from the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule, and this is likely to have a positive impact on employee wellbeing. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest that longer workdays aren’t productive — and in some cases, they can even be counterproductive. Working from home or from a different location entirely can help employees avoid the pressure of a traditional 9-to-5 schedule and make better use of their time. Remote work also allows employees to focus on the tasks that are most important, rather than spending time commuting to work or doing work that isn’t relevant to their job. And as more work is done digitally, there are more opportunities to work around other commitments — like caring for children or other family members.

## Conclusion

Whatever happens, it’s clear that the future of work will look very different from the way we work now. New technologies will enable more flexible ways of working, whether it’s working remotely, collaborating virtually, or finding new ways to use AI. And while these changes may bring some challenges, they’ll also present more opportunities than ever before to find meaning in the work we do. The future of work is the future of humanity — and it will be an exciting ride.
