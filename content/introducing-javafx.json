It is a scene-based, declarative programming language that is designed for composability, extensibility, and high performance. JavaFX can also be used to create applications for embedded systems, such as media players, digital signal processors, and medical instruments. It allows you to create GUIs and applications using a combination of code and visual tools to create apps.
