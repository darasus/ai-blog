This means that the VBox has no positioning \\u2013 it\\u2019s always placed at the top left corner of the screen by default.\nThe VBox is bound to the root node of the Scene.

Containers don\\u2019t have layouts \\u2013 they simply arrange their child nodes, but without a specific layout.\nThe VBox is used as the root node because it\\u2019s a very flexible control, and will generally work well in most scenarios.

A FlowPane is a layout which arranges its children horizontally.\nThis means we can add our controls to the FlowPane, and those controls will be arranged horizontally.

For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them.
