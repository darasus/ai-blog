It arranges those items vertically.\nIn this case, the VBox is used as the root node of our JavaFX interface. This means that the VBox has no positioning \\u2013 it\\u2019s always placed at the top left corner of the screen by default.\nThe VBox is bound to the root node of the Scene.

Containers don\\u2019t have layouts \\u2013 they simply arrange their child nodes, but without a specific layout.\nThe VBox is used as the root node because it\\u2019s a very flexible control, and will generally work well in most scenarios.

A FlowPane is a layout which arranges its children horizontally.\nThis means we can add our controls to the FlowPane, and those controls will be arranged horizontally.
