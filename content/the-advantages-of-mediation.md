Mediation is a process in which a mediator facilitates communication between parties to help them resolve a dispute. Mediation is an alternative to traditional litigation in which parties present their cases to a judge or jury. 

Mediation has many advantages over litigation. First, mediation is less expensive than litigation. Mediation typically costs between $500 and $5,000, while litigation can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Second, mediation is faster than litigation. A mediation can be scheduled within a few weeks, while a trial may take months or even years to complete. Third, mediation is confidential, while litigation is public. This means that the partiesâ€™ confidential information, such as financial information, will not be disclosed to the public if the matter is resolved through mediation. Fourth, mediation is flexible and can be tailored to the specific needs of the parties. For example, the parties can agree to mediate in person, by telephone, or even by video conference. Fifth, mediation allows the parties to control the outcome of their dispute. In litigation, the judge or jury decides the outcome of the case. In mediation, the parties decide how to resolve their dispute. 

Overall, mediation has many advantages over litigation. Mediation is less expensive, faster, more confidential, more flexible, and allows the parties to control the outcome of their dispute. If you are involved in a dispute, you should consider mediation as an alternative to litigation.
