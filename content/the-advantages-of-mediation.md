summary: Legal fees can quickly add up when you go to court, but mediation is
  significantly cheaper. Mediation is a worthwhile alternative to litigation
  because mediation allows you to resolve your dispute in a private and
  cost-effective setting. Mediators don’t have the authority to make a ruling in
  your favor. Instead, mediation allows both parties to make their own decision
  on how to proceed with the dispute. In mediation, there are no lawyers
  involved and no court costs; the only cost you’ll incur is the cost of the
  mediator.

## Mediation Can Help You Save Time and Money

If you’re involved in a legal dispute, you are likely to incur a substantial amount of money in legal fees. The amount you spend on legal fees depends on a few factors, including: The type of dispute and the complexity of the issue, the number of parties involved in the legal action, the jurisdiction of the court in which your case is being heard, the length of time it takes to resolve your legal matter, the court fees and charges that apply to your case, and the amount of time it takes for you to be served with papers or for papers to be served on you.
Depending on the nature of your dispute, you may or may not be required to pay court filing fees and other administrative costs, but it’s safe to assume that legal action is considerably expensive. In addition to the money you spend on your lawyer, you’ll also have to cover the other party’s legal costs as well as court fees. In mediation, there are no lawyers involved and no court costs. The only cost you’ll incur is the cost of the mediator. In comparison, the average cost of mediation is $350 per hour versus the $350 per hour it costs to hire a lawyer. Legal fees can quickly add up when you go to court, but mediation is significantly cheaper.

## Mediation Allows Both Parties to Come to a Resolution They Are Happy With

When you go to court, you’ll likely be expected to accept the ruling of a judge. Judges are required to make decision for the benefit of all parties involved in a dispute, but their decision is final — you have no recourse if you disagree with the ruling. In a mediated settlement, both parties are free to accept or reject an offer from the other party. Mediators aren’t empowered to make a binding decision like a judge. Instead, they facilitate discussion between both parties involved in a dispute. Mediators are trained to help both parties come to an agreement that both sides are happy with. Mediators don’t have the authority to make a ruling in your favor. Instead, mediation allows both parties to make their own decision on how to proceed with the dispute.

## Mediation Provides a Chance for Both Parties to Resolve Their Conflict Nationally and Equally

In the United States, we have a system of federal courts that govern disputes between parties from different states. If you have a dispute with another party that’s from a different state than you, you have to file your claim in the state where the other party is based. A dispute like this is called an “interstate” or “diversity” claim, meaning that the two parties involved in a dispute come from different states. If you want to go to court, you have to file your lawsuit in the state where the other party is based. This is called the “seat” of the lawsuit. If the other party lives in California and you live in New York, you have to file your lawsuit in California because that’s where the other party lives. If you file your lawsuit in California, you’re at a disadvantage because the laws in California may be different than the laws in New York. The judge presiding over your case will be more familiar with California law and less familiar with New York law. You could be at a disadvantage because California laws may not be as favorable for you as New York laws.

## Conclusion

When you’re involved in a dispute, your time, energy, and mental health are likely to suffer. Mediation is a worthwhile alternative to litigation because mediation allows you to resolve your dispute in a private and cost-effective setting.
If you’re currently involved in a legal dispute, mediation may be beneficial for you because it allows both parties to come to a resolution they are happy with, allows both parties to resolve their conflict nationally, and saves you time and money.
