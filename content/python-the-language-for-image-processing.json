You will have to face challenges and difficulties in your work almost every day. In order to overcome these challenges, you need to consistently find ways to improve your coding efficiency and speed.\nWorking efficiently as a software engineer is challenging for most people. Most developers have so many different things on their minds at any given time that it can be hard to keep track of everything simultaneously. As a result, most coders perform slowly because they are thinking too much about what they\\u2019re doing rather than just doing it. However, with practice and dedication, you can learn how to code faster.\nBelow, we will walk you through some tips that will help you become more productive with your coding and accelerate your workflow significantly.

We will cover the fundamentals of setting up a project, creating tables and handling user logins.\nWe have all probably heard of SQL databases before. They are used to store data in tables so that you can query the data efficiently. Each table has columns with the properties of that entity stored as values in those columns.\nHowever, building an entire database from scratch is not something that most developers would want to do on a daily basis. This is where Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries come in useful. Instead of dealing directly with SQL tables and their contents, you can use these libraries to represent your domain objects as entities in their own right. Once you\\u2019ve done that, it becomes much easier to persist them into your database without writing any SQL statements yourself!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
