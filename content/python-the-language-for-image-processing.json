  "intro": "Computer vision and image processing are key to enabling machines to understand the world. For example, modern cars can detect pedestrians with cameras rather than other sensors because the camera can identify them as non-moving objects that are smaller than usual trees and have different reflectivity from typical road markings. \nThis article covers Python, an increasingly popular language for image processing tasks. It’s a dynamic language like Ruby, which makes it easier to read and write programs. Furthermore, Python includes several useful libraries for image processing such as OpenCV (Computer Vision) and PIL (Python Imaging Library). If you’re new to programming, check out our article on Why Python is a Great First Programming Language.",
  "content": "## Introduction to Image Processing\n\nImage processing is the science of manipulating images and the systems and computer software used for this purpose. It is a vast and interdisciplinary field with applications in many fields, including engineering, medicine, science, architecture, and visual arts.\n\nThere are many different types of image processing. They can be grouped according to the type of image content being processed or the type of visualization desired. Some examples include image recognition, image reconstruction, image restoration, image retouching, image segmentation, image compression, image registration, and image sequence visualization.\n\nThese techniques are typically used to create or enhance images. They can be used in security applications such as recognition of license plates or facial recognition, or in medical applications such as tomography or DNA analysis. Image processing can be applied to audio or text data as well as images.\n\n## What is Image Processing?\n\nImage processing is the process of applying computational image-analysis techniques to digital images to produce new images or image derivatives. Image processing is used for image/s that were previously taken by a camera.\n\nImage processing can be used for a wide variety of applications. Some examples include recognition of faces in pictures, change in buildings over time, analysis of geographical/topographical maps, analysis of satellites/climate data, etc.\n\n## Installing OpenCV in Python\n\nOpenCV is a popular open-source library for computer vision that can be used with Python. It includes hundreds of algorithms for image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. The installation instructions for OpenCV differ slightly for different operating systems (OS).\n\n## Running Python Scripts\n\nPython on its own doesn’t have a graphical user interface (GUI), but as it’s so popular, many different GUIs have been created that you can interface with Python through. These GUIs can use images to display the results of your programs.\n\nFor example, you can create a GUI that allows you to click on images and run image recognition algorithms to see if the image is an image of a car, cat, or person. You can also create GUIs using libraries like Tkinter or WXPython, which allows you to create an application that can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n\n## Wrapping up: Why you should use Python for Image Processing\n\nComputer vision is a very computationally intensive task, and Python makes it easier to process images with its simple syntax and available libraries for image processing.\n\nImage processing is not only useful for computer vision, but it can be used for many other tasks such as image recognition for identification of people, places, or things. The power of Python makes it a very good choice for image processing.\n\nMoreover, Python is easy to read and write, which makes it a good choice for beginners. If you need to analyze images, you should use Python for its simplicity and efficiency. You should also consider using Python as it’s a very popular language and is used by many industries."
