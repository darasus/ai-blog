It\\u2019s a dynamic language like Ruby, which makes it easier to read and write programs. Furthermore, Python includes several useful libraries for image processing such as OpenCV (Computer Vision) and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

They can be grouped according to the type of image content being processed or the type of visualization desired. Some examples include image recognition, image reconstruction, image restoration, image retouching, image segmentation, image compression, image registration, and image sequence visualization.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"These techniques are typically used to create or enhance images. They can be used in security applications such as recognition of license plates or facial recognition, or in medical applications such as tomography or DNA analysis. Image processing can be applied to audio or text data as well as images.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"What is Image Processing?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Image processing is the process of applying computational image-analysis techniques to digital images to produce new images or image derivatives. Image processing is used for image/s that were previously taken by a camera.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Image processing can be used for a wide variety of applications.
