intro: >-
  Supermarket bills are a source of worry for many households. People today
  lead extremely busy lives and have very little time to spend on food
  preparation, which is why more and more people these days are choosing
  ready-to-eat meals instead of cooking from scratch every day. After all, who
  has the time for that?

  However, the convenience of ready-made food comes at a price. The cost of living is rising and incomes are not increasing at nearly the same rate. Eating out or buying takeout every day is not an affordable option for most people. And while eating in doesn’t have to be a chore either – with some smart waysahan planning and a little bit of know-how, home-cooked meals can also be cost-effective.

## Use price comparison apps to find the best deals

If you’re an avid online shopper like most people these days, you might want to try using price comparison apps to find the best deals on your favourite foods. Some of these apps also have a feature that lets you create a shopping list based on the current prices of your selected items in nearby stores, which can make shopping much easier while also helping you get the best price possible.

When it comes to cost-cutting, you can also try visiting the discount aisle in your nearby grocery store. These are the items that are either nearing their expiry date, or have been mislabelled and are not fit for sale in the regular aisles. Some grocery stores even mark these items at a 50% discount. So why not stock up on a few of your staple items while you’re there?

## Buy in bulk

Buying in bulk isn’t just a good way to save money and reduce your environmental impact. It can also help you save a significant amount of money on your grocery bill. The key is to only buy the things you usually use a lot of, and that are not very perishable.

Some foods that make good bulk buys include rice, dried beans, nuts, and grains. Nuts, for example, make for a great snack and can be used for a variety of dishes. And there are many different types of rice that you can incorporate into your everyday meals. Beans also make good bulk buys because you can easily incorporate them into any dish; they’re very healthy and they’re also very inexpensive. You can make great soups, curries, and stews with dried beans. And they’re very cost-effective, since you only need to buy them in bulk.

## Stick to your list when shopping

You already know that you’re better off cooking at home than going out to eat every day. But you can also save even more money by shopping at home. Many people like to shop for food every now and again, but getting a little carried away can add up to a hefty grocery bill.

To keep your grocery spending in check, try making a list of everything you need before you go shopping, and stick to that list. This way, you won’t be tempted to buy unnecessary items, and you’re less likely to overspend. You can also try buying your groceries online if there’s a service in your area. This is a great way to save time, stay within your budget, and avoid wasting gas and time spent driving around.

## Dried beans and legumes are cheap and healthy

Most people don’t even realise that beans are vegetables, but they are. Beans are also incredibly healthy, cheap, and easy to prepare. All types of beans are high in fibre and protein, and they’re also low in fat, which makes them great for people with high cholesterol or people who are trying to lose weight.

Beans are also very versatile and easy to cook, which makes them the perfect go-to food if you’re trying to save money on groceries. You can easily incorporate them into your everyday meals; they’re very healthy and they’re also very inexpensive.

## Frozen vegetables are another smart option

Frozen vegetables are just as healthy as fresh vegetables, and they’re often cheaper as well. Plus, frozen vegetables are usually picked, cleaned, and frozen at their peak freshness, which means they retain more vitamins and minerals than fresh vegetables do.

Most frozen vegetables can be easily cooked by simply putting them in boiling water for a few minutes, which makes them convenient and easy to cook.

## Conclusion

Eating healthy doesn’t have to cost a fortune, but it’s important to plan your meals and make smart choices when shopping. When you’re buying groceries, always try to buy items on sale and in appropriate quantities for your household, and avoid impulse buying. Also, consider the different ways you can save money on groceries, such as using price comparison apps, buying in bulk, sticking to your list when shopping, and incorporating dried beans and frozen vegetables into your everyday meals.
