  There are a lot of programming languages out there today. Each has its
  own unique set of features, strengths, and weakness. Some are more general
  purpose than others; some are more suited to specific tasks.

  This article will explore the Python programming language and why it’s so useful to know if you’re interested in becoming a software developer. After reading this article, you should have a solid understanding of what Python is and why it stands out from other popular programming languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, and others.

## What is Python?

Let’s start off by taking a look at what Python is. Python is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1991 by a Dutch programmer named Guido van Rossum. The language takes its name from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom van Rossum was a fan of. The language has come a long way since its creation, and it has been used in a wide variety of different industries through the years.

## Why Is Python So Popular?

One of the reasons that Python is so popular is that it’s very readable and easy to understand. While it’s not the simplest language that exists, it falls somewhere in the middle – meaning that it will be easier for a beginner to understand, but it’s also powerful enough for an experienced programmer to use.
When you’re just getting started programming, you don’t want to have to deal with a language that’s overly complicated or confusing. You’re trying to learn the basics, and a complicated language will just make that more difficult.
Python is a great language for beginners to start out with because it’s easy read and understand. When you’re ready to move on to other languages, you’ll already have a solid foundation that will make the transition easier.

## How to Learn Python

If you’re interested in learning Python, the first thing you should do is find a beginner’s Python tutorial. There are tons of free tutorials online that will help you get started.
You can also find tons of free ebooks that will walk you through the basics. If you prefer to read a physical book, you should be able to find one at your local bookstore.

## What Can You Build With Python?

A lot of people wonder what they can build with Python. The truth is that there are a lot of different things that you can create with Python.
There are several types of applications and web services that rely on Python for their functionality. Some of the most common are:

- Data Science and Machine Learning: One of the most common uses of Python is in the fields of data science and machine learning. These two fields involve lots of data analysis, statistics, and complex calculations. Because Python is such a versatile language, it’s well-suited to these tasks.
- Financial Services: Python is also commonly used in the field of financial services. This is because software developers can use Python to create software that accesses multiple financial services at once. This is called “financial algorithm coding”, and it’s used for things like stock trading, foreign exchange, and more.
- Gaming: You might not think about it, but gaming companies use Python for a variety of different tasks. One of the most common uses of Python in the gaming industry is to create artificial intelligence characters. Python is also used for things like generating the graphics displayed in the game.
- Web Development: Web development is one of the most popular industries that uses Python. This is because it’s a general-purpose language and can be used to create both server-side and client-side applications.

## Who Uses Python?

As we discussed above, there are tons of different industries that use Python as a programming language. We’ve already gone over a few of them, but let’s take a look at the others.

- Data Analysts: Data analysts are the people who sift through data, put it into charts and graphs, and try to determine what information is useful and what isn’t. Most data analysts use Python for their work because it makes data analysis much quicker and easier.
- Data Scientists: Data scientists are data analysts that focus more on the “what does this mean?” aspect of data analysis. They use Python to find patterns and trends in the data, and then they interpret those patterns.
- Financial Analysts: Financial analysts use Python to create algorithms that help them predict future stock prices. Python can take into account a huge amount of different factors and create a model that helps predict the future.
- Web Developers: Web developers use Python to build websites, create databases, and more. Python can be used to create a wide variety of different things on a website, including things like the user interface, databases, and more.

## Summing up

There are many different programming languages out there, and each one has its own unique set of features, strengths, and weaknesses. A lot of people tend to think that only developers get to use programming languages, but the truth is that there are many different uses for programming languages.
This article explored what Python is and why it’s so popular among a wide variety of industries. We also discussed how to learn Python if you’re interested in the language, and we took a look at what you can build with Python and who uses Python.
