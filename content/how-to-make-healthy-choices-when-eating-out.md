intro: >-
  Eating out can be a fun and social experience. Whether you’re meeting
  friends for a bite to eat after work, happy hour with coworkers or date night
  with your significant other, there are many restaurants that offer an
  experience that’s enjoyable and hassle-free. However, eating out — whether
  it’s at a fast food joint, casual chain or upscale eatery — isn’t always the
  healthiest option.

  In fact, many restaurants serve high-calorie foods that aren’t particularly good for you. The mammoth size of most restaurant portions is also concerning, as it can lead to overeating and unnecessary intake of saturated fats, sodium and added sugars.

  However, with some knowledge about what to look for when dining out, you can make healthy choices that support your diet and lifestyle goals while still enjoying yourself at the same time.

## Know The Basics Before Going Out To Eat

Before heading out to try some of the best restaurants in your area, it’s important to know some key facts. This will help you identify the dishes and menu options that are best suited to your dietary needs.
First, you’ll want to consider the type of establishment you’re going to. Casual chain restaurants such as Outback Steakhouse, Chili’s or Applebee’s are generally the best bet for people eating a balanced diet. They’re usually family-friendly and have plenty of options that suit most dietary needs, including special menus for vegetarians, vegans and those with gluten intolerance or allergies.
You also want to make sure you check the hours of operation before leaving the house. This is especially important if you’re meeting friends or colleagues for happy hour or late night. Most casual restaurants are open until the late evening, but some only serve breakfast or lunch.

## Plan Ahead

Before heading out to eat, make sure to plan ahead. This will help you avoid making poor choices at the restaurant, which can often lead to over-eating.
If possible, visit the restaurant ahead of time to scope out the menu and decide what you’ll order. If you’re in a rush, you can also check out the menu online before you go.

If you have dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate them to your server. This will help avoid problems when it comes time to place your order.

## Select The Right Restaurant

If you have dietary restrictions, you may need to be a little more picky about which restaurants you choose to eat at. Don’t worry, though; there are plenty of options. If you’re not sure where to start, consider the following factors. Atmosphere - While this may not be a major consideration if you’re eating solo, or with close friends or family, it can be helpful when you’re meeting clients or colleagues for business meals. A quiet and casual atmosphere is often best. If you’re looking for a place that’s lively and has a fun vibe, though, you’ll want to find a restaurant that’s a little noisier. Location - You’ll want to consider where the restaurant is located. If you’re meeting clients, or want to be close to work, try to find a place that’s centrally located. If you’re going out with friends, though, you may be better off eating at a restaurant that’s farther away, so you have time to relax, enjoy your food and not have to rush back to the office.

## Watch (and ask) What Goes Into Your Food

If you’re curious about how a certain dish is made, or how the chef prepares your seafood or meat, feel free to ask. In fact, many chefs and servers are happy to provide details about the ingredients they use and how they’re prepared.
When ordering salmon, for example, you may notice that it’s grilled, not baked. If you’re worried about potential toxins in the grilled salmon, you can ask your server about the salmon’s preparation and whether it was cooked in healthy oils.

Similarly, if you’re ordering a salad, you may be concerned about whether the dressing is made with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. If so, feel free to ask the server about it.

## Commit To A Healthy Side Dish Or Vegetable

If you’re ordering a meal that doesn’t come with a side dish or vegetable, it’s easy to go off-course nutritionally.
To help keep your meal balanced, commit to ordering a vegetable side dish, such as broccoli or green beans. This can also help you avoid the dreaded “Clean plate club” (i.e., eating so much of your main dish that there’s nothing left on your plate).

Also, don’t be afraid to ask for a smaller portion of your main dish, such as having a baked potato instead of the baked potato with butter and sour cream combo.

## Don’t Be Afraid Of The Fresh Produce And Lean Proteins

Many restaurants offer large salads and some offer baked potatoes as healthy alternatives to French fries. If you’re not a salad person, though, don’t feel obliged to order one as a side dish.
Instead, try to order fresh fruit as a dessert and commit to a baked potato as your side dish. If you’re not sure what to order, look for protein- and fiber-rich foods such as grilled chicken, salmon, beans, quinoa, brown rice and vegetables.

If you’re concerned about overeating, or if you’re just trying to avoid eating too many calories, be careful when choosing baked potatoes. Although baked potatoes certainly have their place as a healthy meal option, they can also be very high in calories.

## Take Home Leftovers

Whilst eating out is great, having a few work lunches a week can be expensive, not to mention the health implications of consuming so much processed food and sodium.
If it’s possible, take a little time to pack up a delicious and healthy lunch to take to work. This will help you avoid the temptation of ordering unhealthy options at the local meal chain, as well as save a little money.

If you’re taking leftovers to work, remember to keep them at an appropriate temperature. This will help you avoid food poisoning and the dreaded stomach ache.

## Conclusion

Eating out can be a fun and social experience, but it’s important to be mindful of your dietary needs when doing so.
By paying attention to the basics, such as the type of restaurant you’re eating at, and watching what goes into your food, you’ll be able to make healthy choices that support your diet and lifestyle goals while enjoying yourself at the same time.

If you’re eating out with friends or family, you may find it helpful to bring along a few snack suggestions, such as nuts, dried fruit, apples or carrots. This can help you avoid cravings for unhealthy options and keep you energized throughout the day.
