When you're trying to eat healthy, restaurant meals can be a real challenge. But with a little planning, you can make healthy choices when you're eating out.

Here are some tips to help you make healthy choices when you're eating out:

1. Look for restaurants that offer healthy options.

There are more and more restaurants offering healthier options these days. So take some time to look for restaurants that offer healthier choices.

2. Plan ahead.

Before you go to a restaurant, take some time to look at the menu and decide what you're going to order. That way, you won't be tempted to order something unhealthy when you're there.

3. Stick to your plan.

Once you've decided what you're going to order, stick to your plan. Don't be tempted to order something else, no matter how good it looks.

4. Ask for what you want.

If you don't see something on the menu that you want, don't be afraid to ask for it. Many restaurants are willing to make changes to their menu to accommodate their customers' needs.

5. Watch your portion sizes.

One of the biggest mistakes people make when they're trying to eat healthy is overeating. So be sure to watch your portion sizes when you're eating out.

6. Avoid the temptation of dessert.

If you're trying to eat healthy, chances are you don't want to ruin your meal with a sugary dessert. So avoid the temptation and skip dessert altogether.

7. Drink water.

Water is always the best choice when you're trying to stay hydrated. But if you're looking for something a little more exciting, try ordering a sparkling water or unsweetened iced tea instead of soda or other sugary drinks.

 following these tips, you can make healthy choices when you're eating out without sacrificing taste or variety.
