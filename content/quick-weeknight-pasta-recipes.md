## Tips for quick pasta dinner recipes

There are a few key tips to keep in mind when cooking quick pasta dinners.
First, chop, chop, chop! Once you’ve selected a recipe, make sure you chop all your ingredients as quickly as possible. This will help you move quickly through the rest of the recipe.
Second, use the right equipment. You don’t need a lot for quick pasta dinners, but some tools can make the process a lot easier. You might want to use a large pot for boiling water and a blender if you’ll be making a creamy sauce.
Third, don’t be afraid to mix up your pasta. While spaghetti is the classic choice for quick pasta, you can also use penne, fusilli, rotini, and more to get your dinner on the table faster.
Fourth, choose fresh ingredients. Quick pasta dinners are all about convenience. You can’t get that if your ingredients are cheap, stale, or expired. Always buy fresh ingredients if you can, and make sure they’re of the highest quality you can afford.

## Rotisserie chicken pasta

Who says you need to use fresh chicken for a pasta dish? If you’ve got a leftover rotisserie chicken in the fridge or freezer, you can use that for a quick and easy pasta recipe.

For this recipe, you’ll want to use about 2 cups of shredded or chopped chicken. Add that to your favorite pasta and top with your favorite sauce. You can use basic cream sauce or try a more unique sauce, like a pesto or balsamic reduction.

This is a super versatile recipe that can be made with many different types of pasta. You can also mix and match different types of sauces to make a truly unique dish every time.

## One-pot pasta with light sauce

All you need for this pasta recipe is pasta, a light sauce, and some vegetables. Opt for simple veggies like garlic, mushrooms, and spinach. Use your favorite light sauce like tomato, cream, or Alfredo. This is a great recipe to try if you’re having friends over.

## 60-second noodles

We all love the idea of slow-simmered sauces and fresh vegetables, but sometimes you just need something quick and easy.
To make this recipe, grab a bag of noodles and a jar of sauce. You can use spaghetti sauce, marinara, or even salsa if you’re daring. Add the noodles and sauce to a pot and heat until warm.

You can also add in some quick-to-cook veggies or meat to round out the meal. Just keep them simple so they can be ready before the noodles are done.

## 15-minute Baked Eggplant Pasta

Eggplant is a versatile vegetable that can be used in a variety of different ways.
Eggplant pasta is a quick and easy pasta recipe that can be made with just a few ingredients. You can serve it with a side of garlic bread for a simple but filling meal.

For this recipe, you’ll need 1 large eggplant, 1 jar of your favorite pasta sauce, and 2 cups of penne. Cut the eggplant into thin slices and coat them with non-stick spray. Bake the eggplant slices at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Remove the slices and let them cool. Then, grab a blender and blend the eggplant slices with the pasta sauce. Using a blender helps create a creamy consistency. Mix the blended eggplant and pasta sauce with the penne until they are fully combined. Place the pasta in a large casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.

Stir everything together and serve.

This recipe is best served warm or hot as the spinach will wilt quickly once it’s been drained.
