The best coders have a set of common habits that allow them to thrive in an often stressful environment. There are many pressures on software engineers, from tight deadlines to the constant demand for new features. Great coders are able to thrive in this pressure-filled environment because of their ability to manage stress, focus intently, and think creatively about the problem at hand.
