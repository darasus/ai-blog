The company has been criticized for using a \\u201Ctake it or leave it\\u201D approach when it comes to data collection and not being transparent about its practices.

Indeed, Google makes an immense amount of money off advertisements and has even admitted to letting advertisers directly select what demographic they want to target.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\\u2019t end there.

However, little has been said about the potential hazards of using the platform.\nUnfortunately, Instagram has been accused of harvesting user data and using it for surveillance. Indeed, the company has been accused of scanning uploaded images for drugs, guns, and other illegal activities.\nWhile this may seem like a good idea on the surface, it is important to note that users are not notified that their images are being scanned. This means that the company is harvesting user data without consent.\nInstagram has also been accused of using user data to target users with advertisements.

Amazon\\u2019s consumer profiles are incredibly detailed, including all the items you\\u2019ve ever purchased, when you purchased them, and how much you paid for them.\nMoreover, Amazon has also been accused of having a lack of transparency in terms of how it uses user data.

Every operation we do in our daily lives involves some kind of technology. This can range from how we get to work, to the way we buy and sell goods and services, the sources we use for information and the way we stay in touch with friends and family. Everything has been made easier thanks to technology. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that enables devices or algorithms to act in a human-like manner as observed in humans and animals.\nAI has many practical applications, such as automatically tagging images on social media sites, detecting spam email filters, or self-driving cars. In this blog post, you will learn more about artificial intelligence, its implications on society and potential future implications of AI on jobs and everyday life.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Users who upgrade to Windows 10 can no longer trust their computer or the software that runs on it.\nWhen you use Windows 10, Microsoft collects personal information about you, your device usage habits, and apps that you install; all of which is transmitted back to the company in an unencrypted format.
