Indeed, Google makes an immense amount of money off advertisements and has even admitted to letting advertisers directly select what demographic they want to target.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\\u2019t end there.

These are both new ways for people to find work that better fits their lifestyle and interests.\nWorking from home, also known as telecommuting, has been around for decades but was only adopted by a small group of people because it was not widely accepted or understood.
