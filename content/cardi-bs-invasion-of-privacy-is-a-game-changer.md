summary: The 14 tracks on this album have all the hallmarks of a great album.
  While the hooks and chorus of each song are satisfyingly catchy, it’s the
  verses where Cardi really excels. She uses her New York accent to full effect,
  her words are staccato and rhythmic and every verse is packed with detail,
  color and character. The stand out track is ‘Drip’ which features on fellow
  New York rapper and friend, Demi Lovato.
intro: >-
  Cardi B has had a remarkable year, thanks to her love of dancing,
  drinking and Instagram. In little over a year the former Vogue editrix from
  New York has morphed into one of the world’s most famous female rappers with
  hit singles, a number one album and now her second studio album. Cardi is on a
  creative roll that only seems to be accelerating; Invasion of Privacy is an
  album that proves she's exactly where she should be, doing exactly what she
  should be doing. 

  With her debut album ‘Gangsta Vibes’ peaking at number 39 in the US Billboard 200 back in 2016, there were not many people ready for Cardi’s recent success. As an artist who was almost entirely unknown outside of New York just 12 months ago, it’s hard to imagine anyone seeing this coming. But as with all great artists it was always there lurking beneath the surface ready to burst and torment us all with its brilliance.

## Cardi B’s artistry is all about the little things

When you look at the contents of ‘Invasion of Privacy’ it’s hard not to be impressed. The 14 tracks on this album have all the hallmarks of a great album; there’s some skits for the comedic value, a nice mix of thought provoking and fun tracks and a couple of songs that nod towards the sound and style of the past. However it’s the little things on each track that really make this album a standout. While the hooks and chorus of each song are satisfyingly catchy, it’s the verses where Cardi really excels. She uses her New York accent to full effect, her words are staccato and rhythmic and every verse is packed with detail, color and character.

## The importance of keeping your head up

‘I Like It’ is the type of song that can become an anthem if people let it; it’s a feel good track with a positive message and a killer hook. The lyrics are a reminder that no matter what you’re going through right now, one day you’ll be better and in a position to help others who are struggling as well. This is a track that can hit home with everyone, everyone has been through something and everyone will go through something again, some of those struggles are a lot more public than others. Keeping your head up and taking note of the things around you is important, it’s how you learn from your experiences, it’s how you grow and it’s how you help others.

## A fully functioning and well-oiled machine

There’s something about the way Cardi B flows over her own beats that hints at her being a perfectionist. On ‘I Like It’, her and Bad Bunny incorporate Spanish and English into the verse, bringing an element of culture and ethnicity to the track. On the ‘Bartier Cardi’ she enlists the help of her husband Offset and delivers a track that could easily become a club and radio staple. However, the stand out track on this album is ‘Drip’ which features on fellow New York rapper and friend, Demi Lovato. The two songs were written separately but were both added to the album at the last minute and it really shows how well Cardi’s team works together. ‘Drip’ is a bouncy bop, but it doesn’t stand out alone.

## ‘Bickenhead’ sounds like something from J. Cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive

‘Bickenhead’ is the track on the album that nods most towards the past and where Cardi comes from. The track has a laid back feel, with a jazz sample and a soothing guitar riff. There’s a feeling of nostalgia as you listen to it; it’s reminiscent of J. Cole’s 2014 Forest Hills Drive album. The track name alone is a nod to the 90’s era when the ‘heavies’ including Puff Daddy, Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls were at their peak. It feels like a time when New York City was the epicentre of the music industry, when it was a clash of culture, fashion and attitude. There’s a feeling of nostalgia and longing for what once was.

## Final Thoughts

It seems that with ‘Invasion of Privacy’, Cardi B has finally found the perfect balance between what she was doing on her first album, and what she’s been doing since she exploded. There’s a fun and frivolous aspect to this album that wasn’t fully explored on her debut, but there’s also an insight, depth and maturity that wasn’t present before. This album is a game changer in the hip hop world and Cardi B is the artist ready to take her place as one of the most important figures in the genre right now.
