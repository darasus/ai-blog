## Cardi B Is More Than Just A “Rap Artist”

One of the first things that stands out about Cardi B is the fact that she raps. A lot. Not just sometimes, but every song on her new album is rapped. If you were to just skim the headlines about the release of this album, you’d see a lot of headlines describing Cardi B as a “rapper” or a “rap artist.” This is not entirely inaccurate. She does, in fact, rap. But there is so much more to Cardi B than just that one label.
Cardi comes from a background in which the art form of hip hop thrives and is at its most raw and unfiltered form. She’s not just rapping; she’s spitting raw bars with unfiltered honesty, making it abundantly clear that she has lived the lives she describes through her music.

## "Be Careful"

One of the most striking tracks on “Invasion of Privacy” is “Be Careful,” in which Cardi B delivers a message of startlingly raw vulnerability. She opens the track with a declaration: “I’m sorry if you feel you’re not good enough.”
Cardi B is no stranger to being criticized in the media, and she has said that this track was inspired by the people who have tried to put her down. It’s an important reminder that people in the spotlight are still human and experience criticism, but also that as fans, we have a responsibility to be careful with how we speak about them. One of the best ways to be careful is to remember that these are real people.
Crushing someone’s ego is one thing. Crushing their spirit is something else entirely, and it’s something we all have the power to do, regardless of whether or not we are famous.

## "Bickenhead" feat. Kodack Black

This song is a love letter to black women everywhere, and it is a moment of proud reclamation. “Bickenhead” features Florida rapper Kodak Black, an artist currently serving a jail sentence for sexual assault who, in the past, has made problematic comments about consent and black women, as well as shown disrespect to women in general in his lyrics.
The decision to include Kodak Black on this track is a bold one and speaks to the power of reclaiming the narrative and using it to create something meaningful. While some have criticized the decision due to Black’s history, Cardi B and the women featured on this track defiantly reclaim this narrative by highlighting their own beauty and power.
As Cardi raps: “Bickenhead, come correct / I’m the baddest, black as the midnight / Snow white and the seven dwarfs / I’m shining like the beacon / You can’t see ‘cause you’re a black man / I’m bringing you bliss, see you with a bliss girl.”

## "Drip" feat. Migos

As Cardi B’s fame has grown, she has become more and more involved with working with other artists. One of the most exciting collaborations on “Invasion of Privacy” is her pairing with Migos on “Drip.”
Cardi B has been open about her appreciation for other artists and their work, but in this song, she comes out and really shows her love for Migos and their music. She raps: “I’m the one that’s in love with Migos.”

## "Bartier Cardi" feat. 21 Savage

By the time you get to “Bartier Cardi,” the final track on the album, you feel like you’ve been on a journey with Cardi B. The track begins as a conversation between a lover and their partner, but it quickly devolves into a conversation between two artists, two people who make their living by sharing their stories with the world.
The song is packed with references to previous songs on the album, and as you listen, you can almost feel the narrative of the entire album coming to a head.
And then, Cardi B ends this journey by sharing a final, raw, and brutally honest message with her fans: “I’m sorry if you feel like you’re not good enough / I know how you feel / You’re not alone / I’m here for you.”

## Final Thoughts

One of the most fascinating things about “Invasion of Privacy” is how much it feels like an invasion.
Of course, this isn’t an insult to the album; rather, it’s an observation about how Cardi B’s raw and unapologetic presence manages to invade our hearts, our minds, and our culture.
She doesn’t tell us what to think or feel. Her words demand that we use them to reflect on our own lives, our own stories, and our own experiences.
We are all invited to experience this invasion, and we are all invited to respond in whatever way we see fit.
