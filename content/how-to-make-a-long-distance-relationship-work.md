When you’re in a long-distance relationship, you have to get creative about how you stay connected to your partner. Whether you’re in a relationship with someone who lives down the street or across the country, here are some tips on how to make your long-distance relationship work:

1. Communicate often.

The most important thing in a long-distance relationship is communication. You need to be able to talk to each other about everything, from the mundane to the important. Schedule regular times to talk, whether it’s a weekly phone call or a daily video chat. And don’t be afraid to text or email each other throughout the day just to check in.

2. Make an effort to see each other.

If you can manage to see each other in person, even for just a weekend every few months, it will make a big difference in your relationship. If you live far apart, try to meet in the middle so you’re both making an equal effort. And if you can’t manage to get together in person very often, make sure you’re staying connected in other ways (see tip #1).

3. Be understanding and patient.

Long-distance relationships can be tough, so it’s important to be understanding and patient with each other. There will be times when one of you is feeling lonely or frustrated, and it’s important to be there for each other during those times. Just remember that it’s worth it, and eventually you’ll be able to be together all the time.
