## Talk Often

Communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship. The more you talk, the better you’ll understand each other and the better you’ll be able to deal with any issues that arise. It’s important to keep the lines of communication open, even when you’re tired or upset.

When you’re in a long-distance relationship, communication is even more crucial. Since you don’t get to see each other every day, you need to stay connected.

Long-distance relationships often involve a lot of time on the phone and video calls, but it’s important to remember that words alone aren’t enough. You also need to consider non-verbal communication, like your tone, body language, and facial expressions.

## Stay in Touch

As mentioned above, staying in touch is essential for any long-distance relationship. But it doesn’t just happen. You have to put in the effort to stay connected. It’s worth it, though!
The best way to stay in touch is to set a schedule for checking in with your partner. How often you communicate will depend on the circumstances of your relationship. If you only see each other once a year, you probably won’t need to talk as often as a couple that sees each other every few months.
You don’t always need to talk face-to-face. You can send letters, emails, and texts. You can also send pictures and use online services, such as blogs and social media, to stay connected.
Keep in mind that not all forms of communication are created equal. While you may be able to get away with writing a couple letters per year, letters take a long time to arrive and are often more personal than other forms of communication, such as emails and texts. Letters also don’t allow you to communicate very often.

## Set Realistic Expectations

Long-distance relationships are hard. You will probably feel less connected to your partner than you would if you lived together. While you can’t ignore the distance, you can try to minimize its impact on your relationship by setting realistic expectations.
To do this, you’ll first want to figure out what your relationship is like during regular circumstances. How often do you and your partner talk? How often do you see each other? How often do you see each other?

Now that you know the status quo, you can adjust your expectations to account for the distance. For example, if you normally see each other two times per month, but you’re in a long-distance relationship, you might want to see each other three times per month.

## Make Travel a Priority

If you and your partner are in different locations, you’ll need to make sure you visit each other as often as possible.
As much as you can, prioritize visiting your partner. If you’re on a tight budget, you might need to make some sacrifices so you can save up for travel. Or, you might have to put extra effort into finding a job that allows you to visit your partner with more regularity.
If your partner is in a different country, you have even more to consider. Not only do you have to arrange for enough time off work, but you also have to prepare for the journey. Depending on where you live, you may need to apply for a visa or other documentation. You also might have to figure out how to get your things to your partner’s country.

## Commit to Constant Communication

Like we said, long-distance relationships can be tough. You and your partner may need to put in a lot of effort to stay connected. Fortunately, there are lots of things you can do to stay connected.
Depending on your circumstances, there are different ways you can stay in touch with your partner. For example, you can use email, phone calls, texts, letters, and social media. You also have the option of using online dating websites, like Plenty of Fish, that specialize in long-distance relationships.
You can even plan fun dates over the phone or online. There are tons of things you can do to stay connected and make the most of your long-distance relationship.

## Take Care of Yourself

It’s natural to want to make your partner happy and put them first in your life, but you also need to take care of yourself.
In a long-distance relationship, it’s easy to let your partner take priority in your life and neglect yourself. But you have to make time for yourself.
Regardless of the circumstances of your relationship, you need to look after yourself enough to be able to give to your partner what they need from you. For example, if you are a full-time student, you need to find time to study and rest. If you can’t do that, you won’t be able to finish your degree, and you certainly won’t be able to give your partner what they need from you.

## Wrapping up

Ultimately, the key to making a long-distance relationship work is communication. If you and your partner can keep the lines of communication open, you’ll be able to work through any issues that arise. You’ll also be able to enjoy the benefits that come with a long-distance relationship, like the fact that you get some time to yourself.
When you’re in a long-distance relationship, it’s important to be honest with your partner. Let them know how you feel and what you need. It’s also important to make time for communication with your partner. You want to make sure you stay connected. With a little effort, almost any long-distance relationship can succeed.
