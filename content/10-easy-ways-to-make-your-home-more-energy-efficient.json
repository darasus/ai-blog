They are great for training children how to behave around animals, especially if the child has allergies. Cats also like being around children and can be very affectionate and loving to them, something that dogs are less likely to be. Cats can be a good training companion for dogs in the same way they are for children. They can be great guides for people who want to start running and challenge their owner to be more active.",
