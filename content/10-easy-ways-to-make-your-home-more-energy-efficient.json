  "content": "## How To Make Your Home More Energy Efficient\n\nThe best way to start making your home more energy efficient is by conducting an energy audit. First and foremost, an energy audit is the process of determining which areas of your home are energy inefficient. This information will be used to help you decide which areas of your home require immediate attention when it comes to making it more energy efficient.\nA thorough energy audit will also tell you how much money you’re spending each month on energy bills and why you’re spending so much. Armed with this knowledge, you can then decide how you want to go about making your home more energy efficient.\n\n## Install LED Lighting\n\nLED lighting is changing the game when it comes to making your home more energy efficient. Simply put, LED lights not only last longer than traditional light bulbs but are also more energy efficient.\nA single LED light can last anywhere from 15 to 25 years, and the average LED bulb uses 75% less energy than the average incandescent bulb.\nThat’s not to say that incandescent bulbs should be completely phased out. There are a few exceptions where they’re better than LED bulbs. The only way to know for sure is to conduct an energy audit of your home.\n\n## Update Your Appliances\n\nAppliances that are more than a decade old are costing you money in two ways. First, they’re using more energy than they need to. Second, they’re breaking down more often than they should.\nIn order to save money on your energy bills while extending the life of your appliances, you should consult a professional to help you select new appliances.\nWhile you may have to spend a little bit of money upfront, the return on investment will be well worth it.\n\n## Weather-proof Your Home\n\nIf your home has holes that allow outside air to get in, you’re losing money and wasting energy.\nProblems like these can be easily identified and solved via an energy audit.\nYou can also easily fix small holes in your walls (typically caused by pests) by purchasing a can of spray foam.\nThe best time to weather-proof your home is in the fall, when temperatures are still relatively mild and you’re not as rushed to get things done.\n\n## Install A Programmable Thermostat\n\nA programmable thermostat is an easy way to make your home more energy efficient. A programmable thermostat allows you to program your heating and cooling system to turn on or off at a certain time.\nWhen used in conjunction with an energy audit, a programmable thermostat is an excellent way to make your home more energy efficient. If you’re not sure how to install a programmable thermostat, you can hire a professional or refer to the instruction manual.\n\n## Add Weatherization Basics: Windows And Doors\n\nWindows and doors are two of the most important areas in your house when it comes to making it more energy efficient. If your windows are old, they’re probably not as energy efficient as they could be.\nDitto for your doors. If you have old doors and windows, you can replace them with new, energy-efficient windows and doors.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, or if you don’t want to replace them yourself, you can hire a contractor to do the work for you.\n\n## Add A Smart Thermostat With Climate Control\n\nAn Eco-friendly thermostat like the Ecobee4 or the Nest is an easy way to make your home more energy efficient.\nThese smart thermostats feature sensors that allow them to keep track of your daily habits and program themselves based on your daily routine.\nThat way, you don’t have to worry about programming your thermostat manually.\nYou can also control your thermostat remotely using an app on your phone.\n\n## Add An Eco-Friendly Roof Coating\n\nYou can extend the life of your roof by adding a roof coating. Specifically, you can add an eco-friendly roof coating that will not only protect your roof but also lower your energy costs.\nWhy is this important? A roof coating like the Gaco-Shine will not only make your roof last longer but will also lower your energy costs by reflecting the sun’s rays away from your house.\nFor instance, roof coatings made with silicate minerals can reflect as much as 97% of the sun’s energy away from your roof, thus dramatically lowering your energy costs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaking your home more energy efficient is not only a smart move but also a necessity. These days, it’s not enough to simply get by. We all need to do more with less.\nThis is especially true when it comes to energy efficiency. No matter what your income level is, you can make your home more energy efficient.\nThe good news is that it doesn’t cost a lot of money to do so. By following the tips in this article, you can make your home more energy efficient.\n\nHowever, you should also remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Every home is different, and there’s no single solution that will work for everyone."
