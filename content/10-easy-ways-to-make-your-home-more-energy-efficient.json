The practice of mediation has continued to evolve over time and today there are many different types, including: family mediation, dispute resolution, community mediation, transformative mediation and collaborative law. However, they all have the same core elements and are intended to achieve the same goals: finding common ground between two parties in conflict; preserving personal relationships; and resolving problems constructively by using active listening techniques.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
