intro: >-
  Coding is an essential skill that can be applied to a variety of roles,
  industries and company sizes. What started as a niche skill used by software
  developers is now a marketable and relevant skill for almost every industry.
  It has become so ubiquitous that even the Department of Labor has highlighted
  coding as one of the fastest growing skills in demand. 

  Coding is most commonly thought of as the ability to create websites, apps and software. However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. The type of coding you choose to learn may have different applications depending on your interests, career trajectory and personal strengths. Read on to learn more about the various types of coding, as well

## Why You Should Learn To Code

First and foremost, learning to code will open up new opportunities for you in whatever field you are currently in. Let's face it, it's a skill that is in high demand, and knowing how to code will give you a leg up on the competition.

You'll have more career options. If you want to move into a new industry or area, but think you don't have the necessary skills, learning to code will help you build those skills. It's a skill that transcends industries and can be applied to just about any job.

You can start a side hustle. Learning how to code can be a great way to start a side hustle, especially if you want to go the coding bootcamp route where you can get a great amount of experience in a short amount of time.

You can create something new or solve a problem you may have personally encountered. Coding is an incredibly creative process, and once you get into it, you'll find there's almost no limit to what you can create.

## Types of Coding

There are many types of coding that you can learn. Here are the most common types that you can explore:

- Web Development: the creation of websites and web applications, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designing, building and managing websites are also included in this field.

- Software Development: the process of designing and building software applications. The most common languages used in software development are Java, Ruby, and Python, but many more exist.

- Mobile Development: the creation of applications for mobile devices (e.g. apps for Android and iOS). The most common languages used in mobile development are Java, Swift and JavaScript.

- Artificial Intelligence: the creation and programming of machines to act and think like humans. This is a very general field with many applications in the real world, such as robotics.

- Data Science: the study and exploration of data to find meaningful patterns, insights and relationships. This field uses programming extensively, as well as machine learning and statistical analysis.
