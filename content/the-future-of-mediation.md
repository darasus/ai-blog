summary: Mediation’s unique combination of active listening, exploration of
  interests, facilitation of creative solutions, and commitment to the parties
  finding their own solutions that makes it such an effective dispute resolution
  process. Mediation is not a one-size-fits-all technique. Different techniques
  may be more or less appropriate for different types of disputes. The goal of
  mediation is not compromise but resolution, but find a place between the two
  extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their
  dispute.
intro: Mediation is a process that helps people resolve conflicts and find
  solutions to difficult problems. It’t not the same thing as arbitration or
  negotiation. Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral third party,
  the mediator, assists others in exploring issues, managing conflict, and
  solving problems in an effort to resolve conflict and move forward. The
  parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all
  times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no
  consequence. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It’t
  win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two
  extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their
  dispute.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such
  as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer
  these services pro bono publico, which means “for the good of the public”
  without charge.

## Why Mediation Works

It’t mediation’s unique combination of active listening, exploration of interests, facilitation of creative solutions, and commitment to the parties finding their own solutions that makes it such an effective dispute resolution process. In mediation, the neutral third party, the mediator, facilitates conversation between the parties involved in the dispute with active listening and exploration of interests. The mediator will not take sides, but instead will help each party to express their interests and explore the other party’s interests through a process of questions, observations, and reflections. Through active listening and exploration of interests, the mediator helps the parties to understand one another and find common ground where possible. Mediation is a voluntary process. The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequences.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer these services pro bono publico, which means “for the good of the public” without charge. 

 ## What is unique about mediation?

Mediation is unique because it is a voluntary process. The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequences. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It’t win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their dispute.

The mediation process is also unique in that it helps parties in a dispute understand each other through the use of active listening and exploration of interests. This is different from other dispute resolution processes where parties work towards a solution without necessarily understanding one another.

## Why doesn’t mediation work for some disputes?

Some disputes don’t work well with mediation because the parties involved are not able to resolve their own issues. Mediation is not a process for people who are unable to make decisions for themselves. It’s also not appropriate for people who are unable or unwilling to be honest and authentic with one another. In mediation, the parties involved are expected to be honest and authentic with one another, which may be difficult or impossible for people who are unable to do that. Some people are not able or willing to overcome their own emotional issues or biases to be open, honest, and authentic with others. In mediation, parties are expected to share information with one another that they have not previously shared. If a person is unwilling or unable to be open and honest with another, then mediation may not work well for that person.

## Limitations of Mediation

Since mediation is a voluntary process, if a party does not wish to participate, mediation will not work. Since the mediator does not make decisions for the parties involved, mediation may not be helpful if one or both parties require a decision from the other party as a prerequisite for participating in the process. If one or both parties are not able or willing to be open, honest, and authentic with one another, mediation may not work.

## The Future of Mediation

The future of mediation looks bright. More and more people are recognizing the benefits of mediation over litigation and are demanding that their dispute resolution process include mediation. Many organizations are now offering mediation services. While mediation is effective for many disputes, it does not work for all of them. Mediation is not a one-size-fits-all technique. Different techniques may be more or less appropriate for different types of disputes. The key is to find the technique that is most appropriate for the dispute at hand.
