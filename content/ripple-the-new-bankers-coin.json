Some of the most reputable exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Bitfinex. There are also many decentralized exchanges like Bisq, where you can buy Ripple as well. Once you have an account, you\\u2019ll need to link a source of funds (like a credit card or bank account). Then, you can buy Bitcoin or Ethereum (or another coin) through the exchange.

First, banks and financial institutions are adopting it as a better way to handle transactions. This means that there will be a huge increase in demand for Ripple, leading to a rise in price. Additionally, Ripple\\u2019s mining process is quite different from mining other coins, making it more centralized. This could help to eliminate the energy consumption issues that other cryptocurrencies face. Ripple\\u2019s price has grown tremendously since its inception.

First, the fact that banks are adopting it as a cheaper and more efficient way to handle transactions could come with some negative side effects.
