In the last couple of years, there has been an increased adoption and development of distributed ledger technology (DLT) \\u2013 specifically, blockchain \\u2013 that has spurred innovative solutions in a variety of industries. The scope of blockchain extends far beyond being simply a mechanism for recording transactions securely. Blockchain enables trust without third parties, which makes it perfect for practically any application that requires keeping track of ownership or monitoring usage rights. Keeping this in mind, if you are launching your own startup and want to incorporate the latest technological advancements into your business model, read on to understand how blockchain can help.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
