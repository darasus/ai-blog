But few digital solutions are as effective and game-changing as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them. This process eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Blockchain technology also has other benefits, including faster transactions and greater transparency.  Moreover, it has the potential to reshape industries from finance to logistics, healthcare and beyond. The widespread adoption of blockchain represents a major innovation in computer science, with implications for almost every industry sector \\u2014 including insurance.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups.
