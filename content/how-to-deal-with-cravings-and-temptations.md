When you're trying to eat healthy, it's normal to have cravings and temptations. Here are some tips for how to deal with them: 

1. Distract yourself. When you're feeling a craving, try to distract yourself with something else. Go for a walk, call a friend, or read a book.

2. Drink water. Sometimes cravings can be mistaken for thirst. Try drinking a glass of water and waiting a few minutes to see if the craving goes away.

3. Eat something else. If you're craving something specific, try eating a similar but healthier food. For example, if you're craving chocolate, eat a piece of fruit instead.

4. Wait it out. Cravings usually only last for a few minutes. If you can wait it out, the craving will likely go away on its own.

5. Avoid trigger foods. If there are certain foods that you know trigger your cravings, try to avoid them altogether. This may mean not keeping them in the house or avoiding places where they're sold.
