## Ketchup

Ketchup is one of the most popular condiments in the world. It’s a sweet and tangy sauce that is generally tomato based and can contain loads of added sugar. While many commercial brands have too much sugar, salt and preservatives, homemade ketchup is a much healthier option. It’s also easy to make and can be made in large batches. To make homemade ketchup, all you need are ripe tomatoes, sugar, salt, onions, garlic, and a blender or food processor. You can also add a touch of vinegar for extra tanginess.

## Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is a creamy condiment made from oil, egg yolks, and vinegar or lemon juice. It’s a key ingredient in many salad dressings and sandwiches and can also be used in savoury dishes like chicken or fish salad. Most people don’t realise that mayonnaise can be made at home, but it’s actually super easy. You can make homemade mayo with just two ingredients – oil and either vinegar or lemon juice. If you want to make a healthy mayonnaise, use extra virgin olive oil and vinegar to make it. If you want it to be more like traditional mayo, use vegetable oil and lemon juice. Whichever ingredients you choose, you should let them sit for around 15 minutes before you start whisking, as this will help to emulsify the oil and vinegar/lemon juice mixture better.

## Mustard

Mustard is a super simple condiment to make at home. To make mustard, you will need mustard seeds (either yellow or black), water, a jar, and a fridge. Simply add your mustard seeds to a jar and pour in just enough water to cover them. Leave the jar in a cool place for a few hours (or even overnight), then pour the mixture into a blender or food processor and blend into a smooth paste. You can add a bit of water if the mustard is too thick. Once done, transfer the mustard to a clean jar and keep it in the fridge for up to a month.

## Chilli sauce

Chilli sauce is a quick and easy condiment to make at home. It’s also much healthier than store-bought varieties, as you can control the amount of salt and preservatives. For a basic chilli sauce, you will need a few handfuls of fresh chillies, a few cloves of garlic, a small piece of ginger (optional), salt, and oil. Simply chop up all the ingredients and add them to a blender along with a splash of oil. Blend the mixture for a few minutes to create a smooth paste, then transfer the chilli sauce to a jar and keep it in the fridge for up to a month.

## BBQ sauce

BBQ sauce is a sweet and tangy sauce that is perfect for meat or vegetables. You can make a basic BBQ sauce at home with tomato ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, and seasoning. Simply mix the ingredients and pour them into a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat down and let it simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once done, take the sauce off the heat and let it cool. Once cool, pour it into a jar and keep it in the fridge for up to a month.

## Sriracha

Sriracha is a super-hot and spicy sauce that is used in many Asian dishes. It’s a great option if you want to add a kick to your meal but don’t want to use hot peppers. There are many recipes online for making your own sriracha sauce, but ours is simple and uses just three ingredients: chilies, vinegar, and sugar. First, you need to roast the chilies until they are nice and charred. You can do this over an open flame, in the oven, or even in a frying pan. Once roasted, simply add the chilies to a blender with a little vinegar and sugar. Let the mixture blend for a few minutes until it becomes a smooth sauce. You can keep the sauce in the fridge for up to a month.

## Red chili paste/Samchur/Chillie-garlic paste

Red chili paste is a condiment that is commonly used in many Asian dishes. It’s made with red chilli peppers and garlic and can be super spicy. You can buy it at your local grocery store, but it is much healthier and cheaper to make it at home. It’s also very easy to make, especially if you use a food processor. Just add a handful of red chillies and a few cloves of garlic to the food processor. The amount of chillies you use will depend on how spicy you want your paste. For a milder paste, use fewer chillies. Let the food processor run for a few minutes until the chillies and garlic are minced and you have created a nice, smooth paste. You can store the paste in a jar for up to a month.

## Sumac Hummus

Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip that is made from chickpeas, garlic, and lemon. It’s a super healthy and nutritious snack that can be served with vegetables or crudités. It’s a great option for vegetarians as it has very few calories. You can buy store-bought hummus, but it’s much healthier (and cheaper) to make it at home. To make home-made hummus, you will need chickpeas, garlic, lemon, tahini, and extra virgin olive oil. Once you have the ingredients, all you have to do is blend them together until you have a smooth dip. You can store the hummus in the fridge for up to a week.

## Tahini-based condiments and sauces: tahini, olive oil, lemon and garlic paste; hommus; and baba ganoush.

Tahini is a seed-based paste that is commonly used in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes. It is a simple paste made from sesame seeds, garlic, lemon, and olive oil. It’s very easy to make and great for a healthy lifestyle. All you need to do is add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until you have a smooth paste. You can store the tahini in a jar in the fridge for up to a month. Tahini can be used in salad dressings, as a sauce for vegetables, and as a spread for bread or crackers.
