You may even know that it\\u2019s something software developers use to create apps and other digital products. What you may not know is that coding can be a lot of fun.\nCoding is essentially the process of creating instructions for a computer, so that it can understand what you want it to do. These instructions are commonly referred to as \\u2018code\\u2019 because they are strings of characters, words, phrases and symbols that appear in text files with a .txt extension.\nCoding isn\\u2019t an easy skill to master and takes many coders years to perfect their skills. However, there are some basic tips and tricks that everyone new to coding should know. Once you understand these principles your code will become more readable and logical making it much easier for others to follow your logic, which ultimately makes your programs more efficient and easy for other coders to update in future if necessary.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways.
