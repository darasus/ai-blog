  "summary": "A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that protein is particularly effective for weight loss when it replaces other carbs in your diet, such as bread or pasta. You can boost protein intake by adding a protein-rich food to each meal such as nuts and seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy products, or lean meat and fish. Whole grains are rich in fiber, which helps prevent disease and keeps you feeling full for hours, so youâ€™re less likely to overeat. Healthy fats like those found in nuts, seeds, avocado, and fish help your body absorb vitamins and promote feelings of fullness.",

In fact, research shows that for lasting weight loss, dieters need to adopt healthy habits that they can sustain for life\\u2014like eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and other low-fat or non-fat sources of nutrients.

A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that protein is particularly effective for weight loss when it replaces other carbs in your diet, such as bread or pasta.\nWhen it comes to weight loss, most experts recommend getting about one-third of your daily calories from protein. But this can be trickier than it sounds. Many popular protein sources are also high in calories or full of fat.\nYou can boost protein intake by adding a protein-rich food to each meal, such as nuts and seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy products, or lean meat and fish.

Exercise alone isn\\u2019t enough, and cutting calories without attention to the nutritional quality of your food simply doesn\\u2019t work.\nYou may find it easier to keep your healthy eating habits at the front of your mind if you plan your meals in advance. You can also prep healthy snacks for yourself to make sure you don\\u2019t find yourself hungry and tempted to reach for an unhealthy convenience food.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Veggies! Veggies!

If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, one way to make sure you\\u2019re getting enough veggies is to fill half your plate with them at each meal.\nYou can also boost the number of veggies in your diet by choosing fresh vegetables over less nutritious canned or frozen varieties. Broccoli and carrots, for example, are much healthier when fresh, and many other vegetables are more nutritious when eaten without added salt or fat.\nEven if you don\\u2019t like broccoli and carrots, there are many other healthy options to choose from. And if you\\u2019re having trouble getting in the recommended amount of veggies, try eating them in creative ways like stir-fries, salads, soups, or stews.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Whole grains are your friend.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Whole grains are rich in fiber, which helps prevent disease and keeps you feeling full for hours, so you\\u2019re less likely to overeat.
