Some people feel that this diet is the best way to reduce their carbon footprint and live in harmony with nature. Others see it as a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet (SAD).\nMany simply like the taste of plants more than meat.

The trick is finding ways to incorporate these elements into nutritious meals so they want to eat them.\nOne way parents have been able to do this is by using smoothies as an opportunity to add hidden veggies into their kid\\u2019s diets without them knowing it.
