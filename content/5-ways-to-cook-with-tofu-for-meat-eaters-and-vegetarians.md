intro: >-
  Regardless of your diet, tofu can be a versatile addition to your meal
  plan. It’s also one of the most misunderstood foods. Everyone knows what
  cheese, fish, and chicken remind us of—which is why for many people, tofu is
  an odd, almost alien food.

## Tofu is great when you want to add protein to a meal.

Tofu is an excellent source of protein. In fact, it’s one of the best vegetarian sources of this macronutrient. Depending on the type of tofu you use, you can expect anywhere from 10 to 25 grams of protein per 100 grams of tofu.
When you’re cooking, simply crumble or mash the tofu and mix it with any other ingredients you’re using. You can add it to stir-fried or scrambled eggs, or use it to make an omelet or frittata. If you’re making a stew or curry, crumble the tofu and add it to the mix for a burst of protein.

## Tofu is also a great meat substitute for vegetarians.

If you’re vegetarian but don’t want to give up the flavors that come with meat, try using tofu as a substitute.
To make tofu taste like meat, you’ll have to use marinades. Simply coat a block of tofu with a spicy marinade, a garlicky marinade, or a sweet marinade. Then, bake or fry the coated tofu until it is crispy on the outside but still retains a soft interior.

If you want to go really bold with your meal, you could use tofu as a substitute for crab in a crab cake recipe. You can also use tofu to make a vegan version of an egg salad sandwich. In both cases, you’ll have to use marinades and seasonings that best suit the dish you’re making.

## You can grill or broil tofu for added flavor and crunch.

Grilling or broiling tofu will give it a nice crunch on the outside while keeping it soft and creamy on the inside. It also gives it a smoky taste that will pair well with many different sauces and seasonings.
To grill or broil tofu, simply wrap it in aluminum foil and cook it for about 25 minutes. Alternatively, you can place it on a grill pan or a baking sheet and arrange the tofu so that it doesn’t fall through the gaps in the grill or grate.

## Marinating tofu before cooking it will make it even more flavorful.

You can also make marinated tofu taste even more delicious. Simply combine your favorite marinade ingredients—including oils, salts and spices, citrus, and herbs—in a bowl before tossing the tofu with the mixture. Then, cook the tofu in any way you prefer: on a grill, in the oven, or on a skillet.

If you want to make your tofu taste like buffalo chicken, use a spicy marinade. If you’d rather have a barbecue-flavored tofu, combine a smoky marinade with a sweet one. You can also try marinating tofu in a teriyaki sauce to make it taste like a savory, sweet, and sticky stir-fry.

## Tofu is also delicious when simply seasoned and served with sauce.

If you don’t have time to marinate your tofu, you can still make it flavorful by simply seasoning it with salt and pepper.
You can also try flavoring it with your favorite herbs and spices. You can also try making a dry-rub with a mixture of sugar, salt, pepper, and whatever herbs you like best.

Once you’ve seasoned your tofu, you can cut it into cubes or strips and serve it with a sauce. You can serve tofu with a variety of sauces, including barbecue sauce, teriyaki sauce, or a simple mixture of soy sauce and lemon or lime juice.

## The last way to enjoy cooking with tofu: use it as a vegan egg substitute.

Like vegetarians, vegans often have to rely on a variety of substitutes while cooking. Many of these substitutes are unhealthy, so tofu is a much better option. 
To make tofu taste like an egg, whisk together 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of water, 1 teaspoon of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of nutritional yeast, and a pinch of turmeric. 
You can use this mixture to make vegan scrambled eggs, omelets, frittatas, quiches, and more. 
It’s important to note that this substitution is best used in savory dishes and shouldn’t be added to sweet dishes like cookies or cakes.

## Conclusion

Tofu is an incredibly versatile food that can be used in a wide variety of recipes. Best of all, it's healthy and easy to cook with! Whether you want to use it as an alternative to meat, or to make a vegan dish, it's an ideal ingredient that you can use in many different ways.
