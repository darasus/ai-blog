## Tofu is a versatile food that can be used in many ways.

The literal translation for tofu is “curdled milk” and is made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. The texture of tofu is firm, smooth and bland and varies from brand to brand depending on how it’s been processed.

Tofu is a rich source of protein and has no cholesterol. It is also a good source of iron, copper and zinc. The plant protein in tofu is complete, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids our bodies cannot produce. Tofu is also an excellent source of calcium.

It is best to store tofu in an airtight container or wrapped in paper towels in the fridge. It can be kept in the fridge for up to a week and in the freezer for up to three months.
