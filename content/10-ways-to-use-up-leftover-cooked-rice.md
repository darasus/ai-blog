## Ask your audience

When you get stuck on what to write or want to try a new topic but aren’t sure how to go about it, the best place to start is with your audience. If you write articles for your business, you need to ask your customers what information they actually want to read about.
It’s important to add forums and other type of discussion boards to your social media marketing strategy. That is one of the many ways to get feedback from your potential customers and keep them engaged with your brand.

If you write for other people, you can still ask your audience for topic suggestions. You might find that some of their ideas are more interesting than the ones you have.

## Research your topic

If you’re just getting started in content marketing, it is important to choose a topic that’s both relevant to your industry and your audience.
You can use tools like Google Trends, Google Keyword Planner or SEMRush to get an idea of what topics are trending or what topics are searched most often.
You could also try SurveyMonkey or even one of the free online surveys like PickSurvey, where you can ask your readers what type of content they would like to see next.

## Check out the competition

If you are writing on a topic where you know there is already a lot of competition, you need to make sure that you stand out from the crowd.
Some ways to do this are to offer something new, create a better title, or write in a more engaging way than others in your field.
You can also try to look at what your competitors are doing wrong and do things better than them.
If you are writing for your business, you can also see what type of articles are currently bringing in the most traffic. This can help you decide what types of articles you should be writing for your audience.

## Think of current events

Find out if there are any current events that you can write about and make your article relevant to those current events.
For example, if you write about cooking, you could write about how to cook with leftovers during the holidays, or how to make Thanksgiving leftovers last as long as possible.
You could write about a current event in any industry and make it relevant to your readers. Current events that are discussed frequently are often good topics to write about.
You can also try to find out trends that are coming or going out of style. This is especially helpful if you are in the fashion industry or writing about beauty or wellness. You can write about how certain types of clothing or beauty products are becoming less popular and why. This can help you to predict what is coming next and get a jump on things.

## Network with others in your industry

If you are looking for ideas for your article, you can also try networking with other writers in your field.
You can find bloggers in your industry on social media and try to become friends with them. You can also join blogging groups on Facebook or LinkedIn and see if others in your industry are willing to help you out.

If you are in school, you can also try to find out if there are any student-run magazines. Often, big universities have magazines that will accept submissions from students. If you find one, you can submit your articles and get some extra practice and feedback from others in your field.

## Change up your writing style or format

If you are writing articles regularly, you might want to change up your style or format once in a while.
Think about what types of articles people expect from you and try to surprise them with something different once in a while. You can change things up by writing an article in a different style, in a different format, or with a different focus.

You could even try writing an article in verse or a haiku if that’s what comes to mind.

You could also try writing an article in a different format, like a listicle or a review.

## Write whatever you want and don’t care about length or word count

Sometimes, the best way to come up with article ideas is to just write about what you want to write about and forget about length or word count.
You might not be able to publish every single article you write, but you can still jot down ideas or notes in a notebook or on your phone. Later, you can organize those ideas and see what you want to write about.

For example, if you are a writer, you could write articles about writing. You could write about different writing styles, tips for improving your writing, grammar, etc. This is especially helpful if you are just starting out since you need to build up your portfolio.

## Bottom line

Writing regularly is one of the best ways to improve your writing skills. If you have been struggling with the thought of how to come up with article ideas, this article can help you out. The best way to come up with article ideas is to ask your readers what topic they would like to read about, research your topic, and then write about what you want to write about. In this way, you can make sure that you are always writing about what you want to write about while also contributing to your readers’ interests.
