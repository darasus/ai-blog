## Chicken and rice casserole

Using up leftover rice in a casserole is an excellent way to use it up, particularly if you are cooking for a group of people. You’ll need to keep in mind that you’ll want to account for the fact that the rice will expand as it cooks. Therefore, you’ll need to increase the amount you use in proportion to the amount of rice you have leftover.
