## Chicken and rice casserole

Using up leftover rice in a casserole is an excellent way to use it up, particularly if you are cooking for a group of people. You’ll need to keep in mind that you’ll want to account for the fact that the rice will expand as it cooks. Therefore, you’ll need to increase the amount you use in proportion to the amount of rice you have leftover. You can use this casserole as an opportunity to add some vegetables to your meal, which is a great way to use up leftover rice. You can mix in broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus, or any other vegetables you have on hand. You can also add some chicken or other meat to the dish if you have it.

## Rice bowl with tuna

Rice bowls are an excellent way to use up leftover rice, particularly if you have some tuna on hand. You can mix in whatever vegetables you have on hand. Cucumbers, carrots, and peas are all excellent choices. You can also add in an egg or two to give the dish some extra protein. Mix the vegetables and eggs together and then add in the tuna and rice. You can also add some soy sauce, wasabi, or other seasonings to give the rice and vegetables a great taste.

## Rice balls

If you have some rice leftover, why not make some rice balls? These are also known as onigiri and are a popular snack in Japan. You can add in pretty much any kind of filling you like, but some good options include salmon, tuna, or ham. You can also add in vegetables like carrots, cucumber, or even radishes.

If you have children, making these with them can be a great way to get them to use up the leftovers.

## Fried rice

If you have some egg and some vegetables on hand, you can easily make fried rice. This is a great option if you have some leftover white rice, as brown rice will be too chewy for this dish. You can mix in pretty much any vegetables you like, including carrots, peas, and onions. You can add in meat if you like, but keep in mind that it will make the dish a bit greasier. You can top off your fried rice with soy sauce, wasabi, or salt and pepper.

You can use any kind of rice for this dish, but we recommend using long grain rice. Long grain rice is drier and fluffier. This makes it ideal for casseroles.
