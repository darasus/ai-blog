Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends).

This might seem as just another case of annoying Hollywood over-simplification: after all, we get so many bioengineered super-geniuses with computer uplink implants that they can become trapped in remote locations via their own stupidity. But there\\u2019s more to it than that.\nIn both book and film, the humanity of Watney comes out in everything he does to survive: logical thinking (how can I eat this potato again?), ingenuity (I need water; how do I distill it from our CO2 filters), courage (explore the abandoned outpost), and compassion (contact my family). He also has a lot of fun with his predicament, cracking jokes through his video log and even going disco.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
