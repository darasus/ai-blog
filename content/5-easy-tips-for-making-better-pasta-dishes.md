1. Start with high-quality pasta. This may seem like an obvious one, but it’s worth mentioning because it really does make a difference. Cheap, lower quality pasta will cook up mushy and won’t hold its shape well, so splurge on some good stuff from an Italian market or specialty store.

2. Don’t overcook your pasta. It should be cooked al dente, which means “to the tooth” in Italian. This means that it should be cooked until it’s tender but still has a bit of a bite to it. Overcooked pasta will be mushy and won’t hold up well to sauce.

3. Use a good sauce. This is another area where quality matters. A jar of pre-made sauce from the grocery store is not going to cut it. Make your own sauce or buy a good quality one from a specialty store.

4. Don’t be afraid to experiment. Pasta is a versatile dish that can be made with all sorts of different ingredients. Get creative and try new things.

5. Follow these tips and you’ll be well on your way to making better pasta dishes. With a little practice, you’ll be an expert in no time!
