  When it comes to Italian food, pasta is perhaps one of the most
  well-known dishes from that region. Pasta and its many different variations
  are loved all over the world, but they’re not always served as ideally as they
  could be. Sometimes a simple pasta dish can end up being more disappointing
  than it should be, mostly because the people making it don’t know how to
  season it properly or add the right ingredients. 

  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make pasta at home again ever again. In fact, with the right tips and tricks, you can make amazing pasta dishes in your own kitchen once again! The key here is to experiment and explore different alternatives for creating that perfect pasta dish you’ve been craving for so long.

## Use good quality ingredients

The most important thing to remember when making pasta is to use the best quality ingredients you can afford. This means using the highest quality pasta you can find, as well as getting the best tasting tomatoes, garlic, and other products that go into your pasta.

Using high-quality ingredients will not only make your pasta taste better, but it will also be more nutritious as well. When you make pasta dishes at home, you also get the chance to use healthier ingredients than you would get at say a restaurant. This is because restaurants often use ingredients that aren’t very nutritious or healthy for you, whereas you can make healthier substitutions at home.

Buying the best quality ingredients available will also make your pasta taste better, since you’ll be able to taste each individual flavor in your meal. The key here is to find high-quality products that aren’t too expensive, so they’re still affordable for you.

## Don’t be afraid of garlic (and other aromatics)

This one may come as a shock to some people, but the truth is that many people shy away from using lots of garlic when making pasta dishes at home. This isn’t a bad thing per se, but it’s something that can be easily corrected.

Pasta dishes don’t always need to be super garlicky (unless you want them to be), but they do need to have some garlic in them. Garlic is a fantastic ingredient that adds a ton of flavour to any meal.

When you cook pasta, it doesn’t get as much heat as say, you’d cook your veggies in. This means that the flavour from your garlic won’t get cooked off, which is especially important with the taste of raw garlic.

Pasta dishes should have a bit of garlic in them, but if it’s overpowering, then you’ve added too much. The best thing to do is to add garlic during the last minute or two of your pasta being in the water. This way it’ll be perfectly cooked and you won’t have to worry about it being too overpowering.

## Add a bit of salt to your water

Salt is something that is often forgotten when making pasta. It’s a staple in nearly every dish, yet few people think to add it to the water when they’re cooking pasta.

Salt is one of those ingredients that you don’t necessarily need to be added to every part of your pasta, but it’s still a good idea to add it to your water. Salt is a natural flavour enhancer, so adding it to the water will make your pasta taste better as well as making it more nutritious.

You don’t need to add a lot of salt to your water either. Just a pinch or two will do the trick, which means this won’t be something that alters the taste of your pasta too much. Rather, it’ll just enhance the flavours you’re already getting in your pasta, making it that much tastier than it would be otherwise.

## Try adding different types of protein

Pasta is usually served with a bit of protein mixed in, but this doesn’t always have to be the case. If you want to serve a vegetarian pasta dish, that’s perfectly fine, but you can also experiment with different types of protein if you want to.

One of the best ways to make your pasta more interesting and delicious is to add in a different type of protein, like chicken, shrimp, or even beans. This way, even if you’re making a vegetarian pasta dish, it will still be a lot more filling and nutritious than if you just added in some veggies.

Some of the most popular types of protein to add to your pasta include chicken, shrimp, and beans. All of these are widely used in different pasta dishes and can really add a lot of flavour and protein to your pasta dishes.

## Mix in some greens with your pasta

Another easy way to make your pasta more nutritious is to add some greens to it. This means that instead of just adding veggies to your pasta, you can add some greens too.

Most people associate pasta with tomatoes and basil, but there are lots of different pasta dishes that are served with different types of greens. Some of the most popular greens to add to pasta include spinach, basil, and parsley.

Adding some greens to your pasta will make it more nutritious, as well as changing the flavour a bit. It’s not something that everyone does, but it’s a great way to make your pasta dish stand out from the crowd.

You can also try mixing different types of greens together, as well as mixing them with other ingredients like tomatoes and garlic.

## Conclusion

Pasta is one of the most loved foods in the world, but it can be hard to make it as well as you’d like sometimes. With these 5 tips, you’ll be able to make better pasta dishes in no time at all.

First, you should use good quality ingredients, including a high-quality pasta. Next, don’t be afraid of adding garlic to your pasta, but remember to add it towards the end. Then, you can try adding different types of protein to your pasta, as well as mixing in some greens with your pasta. Once you’ve done all this, you’ll be able to make amazing pasta dishes that are both delicious and nutritious.
