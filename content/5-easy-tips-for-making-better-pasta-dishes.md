## Research and plan

Research is the foundation to any excellent piece of content. If you don’t have a strong foundation, it’s difficult to build something great.

The best advice we can give is to make sure you have access to a good source of information, and that you know how to sift through it.

## Use the key word scout pro tool

You can’t just write about pasta, it has to be about how to make better pasta dishes. This will depend on what your audience is searching for. If you want to write about a specific topic, you have to research what terms people are searching for.

Keyword Scout Pro is a great tool for finding these terms. You just put in a topic, and it will show you related terms. It also shows you a graph that shows how popular the terms are.

## Use the blogging pro tool for research

Blogging is another way to conduct research and find terms your audience is interested in. It’s a great way to see what type of content works well on your website. It’s also a good way to see what type of content your competitors are producing.

## Outline your article

Your outline is the skeleton of your article. If it’s not properly organized, you’ll end up with a botched piece of writing. A strong outline will help you stay focused and on track. It’s also the most efficient way to communicate your ideas.

## Estimate word count with the Google tool

The best way to estimate word count is to use a word count tool. There are a lot of these online. Many websites will also have a word counter on their site.

Google Docs has a word counter built into it. Just open up a document and click Tools > Word Count. This will show you how many words you have.

## Write!

OK, so you’ve done all the research. You’ve found the terms your audience is searching for, you’ve organized your ideas, and you’ve estimated your word count. Now what? You write the darn article!

The best way to write your article is to just get started. If you’ve done all the prep work, and you know what you want to say, you can write the article quickly. So just get to it!
