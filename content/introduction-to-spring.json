  "summary": "Spring is an open-source application framework that supports integration of additional software modules and components with applications. The Spring Framework is used for building enterprise Java applications for a wide variety of industries and uses. It uses a bean-based approach that provides a consistent programming model for developing Java applications. Spring is extensible and modular, which means you can easily add new functionality to your applications. You can use Spring to create applications in many different languages, including Java, Groovy, Scala, and more.",

Files are stored as strings or bytes. If you have used other programming languages before, this will be familiar to you. In Java, there are two separate ways of working with files: standard streams and the new \"File\" class introduced in version 1.1 of the language.
