The Spring Framework is used for building enterprise Java applications for a wide variety of industries and uses. It uses a bean-based approach that provides a consistent programming model for developing Java applications. Spring is extensible and modular, which means you can easily add new functionality to your applications. You can use Spring to create applications in many different languages, including Java, Groovy, Scala, and more.",

One such framework is Spring, which is currently one of the most widely used lightweight enterprise solution platforms available today.
