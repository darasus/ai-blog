They create, maintain and update the software that powers businesses, websites and apps. And demand for software engineers continues to grow. Job postings for software engineers have increased by 37 percent in the last five years, with an additional 26 percent increase expected by 2024.\nSoftware engineering is also one of the most competitive fields to break into at the moment. There is a shortage of skilled candidates, which has led to high demand and high salaries for top software engineers who can drive innovation in their companies. To become a software engineer and land one of those coveted jobs, you will need to complete a computer science degree or take up coding classes.

This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another. This is called inheritance in Java. It is one of the cornerstones of OOP programming and something that every serious programmer should know well.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
