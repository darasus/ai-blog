  "summary": "Spring is an open-source application framework that supports integration of additional software modules and components with applications. The Spring Framework is used for building enterprise Java applications for a wide variety of industries and uses. It uses a bean-based approach that provides a consistent programming model for developing Java applications. Spring is extensible and modular, which means you can easily add new functionality to your applications. You can use Spring to create applications in many different languages, including Java, Groovy, Scala, and more.",

As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually.
