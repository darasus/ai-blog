JavaFX has a variety of built-in layout managers that help you arrange your GUI components in the right way. The most common ones are the BorderPane, the StackPane, the GridPane, and the FlowPane.

The BorderPane is the simplest of the four and puts your components in the four different borders: top, bottom, left, and right. You can also put a component in the center.

The StackPane stacks your components on top of each other. This is useful if you want to overlay one component on top of another, like a menu on top of a window.

The GridPane lets you put your components in a grid. This is useful for arranging things in a tabular format.

The FlowPane flows your components from left to right. This is useful for things like toolbars where you want the buttons to be arranged horizontally.

There are also a few other layout managers, but these four are the most commonly used.
