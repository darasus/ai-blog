As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually. Let\\u2019s take a look at some of the best coding tools that every developer should know about!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways. Object-oriented programming is a way of writing programs that aims to reduce redundancy and increase modularity by using objects that have their own data fields and methods that act on those fields instead of global variables.

What started as a niche skill used by software developers is now a marketable and relevant skill for almost every industry. It has become so ubiquitous that even the Department of Labor has highlighted coding as one of the fastest growing skills in demand.\nCoding is most commonly thought of as the ability to create websites, apps and software. However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. The type of coding you choose to learn may have different applications depending on your interests, career trajectory and personal strengths.
