Rather than simply enabling users to access information from a website, RIA applications typically provide users with the ability to take action on that content. For example, rather than simply providing users with information about a product and its price, an RIA application might enable users to add the product to a shopping cart and complete the purchase process.\nThis article introduces you to Java RIAs so that you can understand why Java developers should use it for developing RIAs.
