Whether you\\u2019re using the internet to browse websites, stream videos on YouTube or Instagram, upload images to Facebook, or store your favorite songs on Spotify, you\\u2019re almost guaranteed to come across data at some point. With so much information floating around online these days, it\\u2019s no surprise that programming languages have become so essential in the tech industry. Computer programmers use various programming languages to create software and other programs that help users accomplish specific tasks or meet objectives within a particular scope of work. There are many different types of programming languages available today, but one of the most popular among developers is Python. In this article, we will explore what makes Python unique and discuss why it\\u2019s such a popular choice for programmers today.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems. The latest technology being adopted by both enterprises and developers is the Internet of Things (IoT).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
