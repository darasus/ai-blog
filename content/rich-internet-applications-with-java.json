It feels like one confusing labyrinth with a lot of locked doors \\u2013 every time you find an unlocked door, it just leads to another locked door! How do we get out of this frustrating loop? Coding shortcuts!\nA lot of coders will tell you that in order to be a successful coder, you need to know everything about coding and all its ins and outs. However, there is a reason why even experienced programmers take note of coding shortcuts. These little tricks make life easier for anyone who is just getting started with coding and doesn\\u2019t have time to invest in learning every last bit of it before they can start creating useful programs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These coding frameworks make it easier for coders to build applications that serve a specific function or group of functions, but require a lot of time and effort to create from scratch. There are many coding frameworks available for coders working on software projects. Which framework you choose will depend on what you\\u2019re developing, your skill level as a coder, and your long-term goals as an employee or freelancer who develops software for businesses or other professionals.
