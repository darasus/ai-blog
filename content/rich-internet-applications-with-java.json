There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
