## What’s Causing The Pandemic?

The pandemic is a result of the H1N1 virus, also known as “swine flu.” This virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009, though it is not uncommon to see the virus surface during each flu season. What is uncommon is that this particular strain of flu is highly contagious and extremely virulent. It has already claimed more than 4,000 lives since its emergence in October 2018.

The virus is spread from person to person. It can be transmitted through coughing or sneezing, touching contaminated surfaces, or coming into contact with someone who is infected. The CDC recommends taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus, including: 

## Air Travel Warning

As the pandemic grows more severe, regulators are warning against all but essential travel, particularly on commercial flights. The risk of contracting the flu is high, and the risk of infecting others is even higher. The CDC has advised against all but essential travel, particularly on commercial flights, in order to prevent the further spread of the pandemic.

This travel warning has led to a 35 percent decline in air travelers in the U.S. alone, contributing significantly to the flight disruptions and cancellations many airlines are experiencing. Many international airlines have issued similar warnings, urging their passengers to avoid air travel unless absolutely necessary.

## Flight Disruptions and Cancellations

Many airlines are experiencing flight disruptions and cancellations as a result of falling demand and unprofitability. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global flight demand has fallen 15 percent since the pandemic emerged in October. This drop has led to a decrease in the number of available seats, which has been further exacerbated by the pandemic travel warning.

As a result, hundreds of flights have been cancelled, including flights to and from New York City, Miami, Boston, and Chicago due to the presence of the flu in these cities.

## Airline Collapses And Mergers May Be Imminent

If things don’t turn around soon, some airlines may collapse while others may be forced to merge in order to stay afloat. Lufthansa, for instance, has been struggling as a result of the pandemic. Lufthansa has had to cancel hundreds of flights and ground hundreds more, which has led to a significant drop in profits and a loss of millions of dollars in revenue.

If things don’t turn around soon, some airlines may collapse while others may be forced to merge in order to stay afloat.

## Where to Go from Here

As the pandemic continues to grow more severe, it’s likely that flights will continue to be disrupted or cancelled altogether. If you must travel for work, keep an eye on the CDC’s website for the most up-to-date travel warning, and check with your airline to see if your flight is still scheduled.

If the pandemic continues to grow in intensity, the CDC may expand its travel warning to include all forms of travel. Stay vigilant, and be sure to keep up with the latest developments as the pandemic progresses.
