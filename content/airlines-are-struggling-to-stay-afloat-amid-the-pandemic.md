Airlines are struggling to stay afloat amid the pandemic. The industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus, with travel demand plummeting and airlines forced to cut capacity and routes. The pandemic has also led to a sharp decline in cargo traffic, as businesses have shuttered and people have stopped traveling. Airlines have been forced to furlough workers, and some have even filed for bankruptcy. The industry is hoping for a rebound in travel demand as the pandemic eases, but it remains to be seen how soon that will happen.
