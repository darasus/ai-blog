summary: The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. Investing
  in your 20s and 30s can be a smart way to help you save enough money to retire
  comfortably. As you get older, you may have to reduce the riskiness of your
  retirement investments to prepare for the future. Knowing your risk tolerance
  is important when investing during retirement. It’s important to know your own
  risk tolerance because if you don’t know your investment portfolio, you should
  increase the percentage of your portfolio even more by increasing the risk of
  your investments.
intro: >-
  The quality of life for most people in their golden years is directly
  correlated to how well they prepared for retirement. According to a recent
  report by the National Institute on Retirement Security, as many as one-third
  of Americans are at risk of being unable to maintain their current standard of
  living in retirement. That’s because many are not putting away enough money on
  a regular basis. 

  An investment strategy that can be useful for helping you achieve your retirement goals is known as "retirement investing." This type of investing is geared toward enabling you to retire sooner with a more comfortable and secure standard of living. If you’re not quite ready to retire but would like to have more financial security once you do, it’s probably time to begin planning for your post-work life. A good place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the many different types of retirement investing available. Understanding these various options along with their pros and cons will help you determine which one(s) might be right for you.

## What is the benefit of investing for retirement?

Retirement investing can help you build a more enjoyable and comfortable retirement lifestyle by giving you ample time to save enough money. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. So, the benefit of investing for retirement is that it allows you to save enough money over a long period of time to be able to retire comfortably.

If you don’t start investing for retirement until you are in your fifties or sixties, the odds are that you’ll have a much more difficult time accumulating enough money to live on during your retirement years. This is because investment returns are maximized by starting to save early and keeping the money invested for a long period of time.

## Types of investments for retirement

- Traditional investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, and cash/money market funds are considered “growth” investments. The growth rate of these investments is in direct correlation to the stock market, which can be both good and bad. This means that when the stock market is doing well, these types of investments will also do well, but when the stock market is performing poorly, so are these types of investments.
- Real estate investments are considered “steady” or “fixed” investments. This means that real estate investments will generally produce a consistent return based on the rental value of the property and the cost to maintain it.
- Fixed-income investments are a type of “income” investment. The income from these investments is fixed and does not rise or fall with the stock market. The income generated from these types of investments comes from contractual interest payments.
- Cash equivalents are another type of “income” investment. The income generated from these types of investments is usually in the form of money market interest rates.

## Why invest in your 20’s and 30’s?

Investing in your 20’s and 30’s can be a smart way to help you save enough money to retire comfortably. For example, if you’re 30 years old and you start investing $3,000 per year, you’ll have $225,000 by the time you reach 67 years old. If you wait until you’re 40 to start investing, you’ll only have $112,000 to show for it. If you wait until you’re 50 years old, you’ll have only $82,000 saved. The sooner you start the better.

## Why you should continue investing before retirement

- To add to your existing retirement savings. If you’ve been investing regularly for several years, you may have accumulated enough money to retire comfortably, but you could also have accumulated more than enough money to retire comfortably. In this case, you might decide to continue investing to add more funds to your existing retirement savings.

- To earn a higher rate of return on your existing retirement savings. If you’ve been investing regularly for several years, your investments will have had plenty of time to grow, which means you’re now earning a higher rate of return on your existing retirement savings.

- To reduce the risk of your existing retirement savings. If you’ve been investing regularly for several years, you may have a sizeable amount of money saved up in your retirement account. You may want to reduce the riskiness of this amount by investing a portion of it in less risky investments such as cash equivalents.

## Knowing your risk tolerance is important when investing during retirement.

Retirement investing takes time, patience, and a willingness to take calculated risks. As we’ve already discussed, stocks are risky investments, but they’re also very good investments since they generally have a high rate of return. As you get older, you may have to reduce the riskiness of your retirement investments to prepare for the future.

This means that if you’re in your fifties, you should be investing less in stocks and more in bonds since these are generally less risky investments. It’s important to know your risk tolerance because if you don’t reduce the riskiness of your investments as you get older, you may not have enough money when it comes time to retire.

## Bonds will also play an important role.

As you get closer to retirement, you should reduce the riskiness of your investment portfolio even more by increasing the percentage of your portfolio that is made up of bonds. This is because the interest rates on bonds are generally lower than the interest rates on stocks, which means that you’re taking on less risk.

Bonds are often considered to be “safe” investments since they are backed by the government and/or large corporations. This means that you’re not taking on as much risk as you would be if you were investing in stocks.

## You’re still not done!

By continuing to invest regularly even after you’ve retired, you can continue to add to your existing retirement savings and increase the rate of return on your investments. This can be especially beneficial if you’ve been investing in stocks because the rate of return on stocks generally increases as the economy grows.

By continuing to invest regularly even after you’ve retired, you can also help to reduce the riskiness of your retirement portfolio. This is because the percentage of your portfolio that is made up of bonds will increase as you get closer to retirement, which means the riskiness of your portfolio will decrease.
