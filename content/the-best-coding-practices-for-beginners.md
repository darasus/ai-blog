summary: One of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code is to
  use meaningful variable names. When you write code, you’re writing a set of
  instructions that a computer can execute. The computer needs to know what
  “clicks” means, so you have to write that in code. Always use const unless you
  have a good reason not to. Make sure to stay on top of current programming
  practices and languages. Some languages are trending upwards in popularity,
  while others are declining.
intro: When you take your first coding class, you’ll quickly realize just how
  much thought goes into writing code. From naming conventions to formatting
  standards, there are a ton of rules and best practices that experienced
  programmers follow to make sure their code is clean and easy to read by
  others. This can feel overwhelming at first. It might seem like there are a
  million things you need to know before you even get started on your first
  coding project. However, trust us – it’s not as scary as it may seem!
  Following coding best practices will not only help you get through future
  programming classes more easily but also prepare you for a career in software
  development. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the most important best
  practices for beginners who are learning to code.

## Use meaningful variable names

One of the most important best practices for beginners is to use meaningful variable names. This may sound silly since the code is only visible to you, but you’ll be surprised at how much easier it will be to understand your code when you use descriptive variable names. For example, say you want to track the number of times a user clicks a button. You could name that variable something like “bClicks”, but that doesn’t really convey what the variable is used for. Instead, you could name that variable “clicks” and write a sentence about what the variable is being used for. You might say “tracks the number of times a user clicks a button”. That way, when you go back to your code months later, you’ll be able to understand what’s going on more easily.

## Comment your code

Comments are lines of code that won’t be executed but are intended to provide more information about what’s happening in your code. Comments are one of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code. Every time you write code you should include a comment that describes what that code is doing. You’ll find that as you work through more advanced coding projects, you’ll be able to look back at your code and understand what’s happening more easily if you’ve used comments to explain everything.

## Only use English in your code

Coding isn’t just about writing syntax or using loops and loops. It’s also about writing logic that computers can understand. When you write code, you’re writing a set of instructions that a computer can execute. For example, if you want to enable a feature, you can write code that says “if a user has a certain payment method, then enable that payment method.” These instructions are meant to be read and understood by a human, but they’re also meant to be read and understood by a computer. At the same time, there are certain things that are specific to the computer – things like the names of variables, loops, and functions. For example, the computer needs to know what “clicks” means, so you have to write that in code. But when you’re writing the code, you don’t want to use words that are specific to a human. You want to use words that are specific to the computer. When you write code, you can only use words that the computer understands. You can’t use any words that are specific to humans. That’s why when you write code, you have to only use English. You can’t use any other languages like Spanish, French, or Chinese.

## Always use const unless you have a good reason not to

Constants are values that you don’t want to change, so you declare them as a constant. This lets the computer know that this value won’t change over time, so it can make some calculations easier. When you’re learning how to code, you’ll find that you’ll use constants quite often. You’ll use them for things like the number of days in a month, the number of hours in a day, or any other value that you know won’t change. When you’re first learning how to code, it’s important to always use const unless you have a good reason not to. The only time you would not use const is if you wanted a value to change over time. For example, if a button needs to change colour over time, you wouldn’t use a constant. If a number needs to change depending on what someone inputs, you wouldn’t use a constant. You would always use a constant unless you have a good reason not to.

## Make sure to stay on top of current programming practices and languages

One of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code is making sure to stay on top of current programming practices and languages. Some languages, like Python, have been around for decades, while others like Rust are brand new. Some languages are trending upwards in popularity, while others are declining. No matter which language or programming practices you decide to learn, it’s important to keep on top of what’s happening in the industry. You never know when a programming skill will come in handy! You also don’t want to be caught off guard if a potential employer asks you about your knowledge of certain languages or practices. Keep an eye on industry publications for new programming languages and trends, and make sure to follow industry leaders on social media. This will help you stay up to date with everything that’s happening in the industry and make sure that you’re prepared for whatever the future may hold!

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of important best practices that you should follow as a beginner learning to code. It can seem overwhelming at first, but if you follow these best practices, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a successful coder!
