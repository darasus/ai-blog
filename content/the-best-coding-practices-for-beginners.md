Coding is a process of transforming computer instructions into a form a computer can understand. It is a process that started with manual coding to create useful, small programs to solve simple problems. Those days are gone. The modern-day coder has at their disposal an amazing suite of tools that allow them to create comprehensive solutions and systems.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. The coder must use their powers for good and not for evil. In this article, we will explore some of the best coding practices for beginners. These practices will help you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

1. Write readable code

One of the most important coding practices for beginners is to write readable code. This means code that is easy to understand and follow. When your code is easy to read, it is also easier to maintain and debug. There are a few things you can do to make your code more readable:

• Use clear and concise variable and function names: Avoid using single-letter variable names (i.e. x, y, z) or generic names (i.e. temp, data, info). Use names that describe what the variable or function contains or does.

• Use white space: Use blank lines and indentations to group related code together and make your code easier to scan.

• Use comments: Comments are your friends. Use them to explain what your code is doing. This will be helpful to you when you come back to your code later and it will also help others who may need to work with your code.

2. Write modular code

Modular code is code that is organized into small, self-contained modules. This is in contrast to monolithic code which is one large block of code with no clear boundaries between different parts of the code. Modular code is easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

There are a few things you can do to write modular code:

• Keep your functions short: A good rule of thumb is to keep your functions to less than 10 lines of code. If you find yourself writing longer functions, consider breaking them up into smaller functions.

• Avoid global variables: Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere in your code. This can lead to unexpected results and make your code difficult to debug. Instead, use local variables which are only accessible within the function they are defined in.

• Avoid side effects: Side effects are changes in state that occur as a result of running a function. For example, a function that modifies a global variable has a side effect. Side effects can make your code difficult to understand and debug. Instead, try to write functions that only return a value and don’t have any side effects.

3. Write testable code

Testable code is code that can be easily tested to ensure it is working as expected. This is important because it allows you to catch bugs early and avoid costly mistakes. There are a few things you can do to make your code more testable:

• Keep your functions small: Smaller functions are easier to test than large functions.

• Avoid side effects: As we mentioned before, side effects can make your code difficult to test. Instead, try to write functions that only return a value and don’t have any side effects.

• Isolate dependencies: Dependencies are external resources that your code relies on, such as databases or web services. Isolating dependencies makes your code easier to test because you can mock or stub out the dependencies instead of having to rely on the real thing. This allows you to test your code in isolation without worrying about the dependencies.
