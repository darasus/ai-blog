It\\u2019s a key ingredient in many salad dressings and sandwiches and can also be used in savoury dishes like chicken or fish salad. Most people don\\u2019t realise that mayonnaise can be made at home, but it\\u2019s actually super easy. You can make homemade mayo with just two ingredients \\u2013 oil and either vinegar or lemon juice. If you want to make a healthy mayonnaise, use extra virgin olive oil and vinegar to make it. If you want it to be more like traditional mayo, use vegetable oil and lemon juice.

To make mustard, you will need mustard seeds (either yellow or black), water, a jar, and a fridge. Simply add your mustard seeds to a jar and pour in just enough water to cover them. Leave the jar in a cool place for a few hours (or even overnight), then pour the mixture into a blender or food processor and blend into a smooth paste.

First, you need to roast the chilies until they are nice and charred. You can do this over an open flame, in the oven, or even in a frying pan. Once roasted, simply add the chilies to a blender with a little vinegar and sugar. Let the mixture blend for a few minutes until it becomes a smooth sauce.

The amount of chillies you use will depend on how spicy you want your paste. For a milder paste, use fewer chillies.
