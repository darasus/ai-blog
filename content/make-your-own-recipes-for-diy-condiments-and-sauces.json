You can make homemade mayo with just two ingredients \\u2013 oil and either vinegar or lemon juice. If you want to make a healthy mayonnaise, use extra virgin olive oil and vinegar to make it.

To make mustard, you will need mustard seeds (either yellow or black), water, a jar, and a fridge. Simply add your mustard seeds to a jar and pour in just enough water to cover them.
