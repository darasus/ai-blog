It involves reading books or online tutorials, practicing skills, watching videos and listening to lectures all by yourself.\nSelf-learning has many advantages over traditional learning methods because it means far more responsibility for your own advancement. You are in control of what you study, how fast or slow you proceed and how much time you devote to each subject. Here are some reasons why self-learning is so much better than traditional methods:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In other words, modern learners want self-directed learning that is current and relevant\\u2014and thankfully there are many ways to achieve these goals.  Self-learning is an effective way for adults to acquire new knowledge and skills, usually in a field they already have interest in or a career they plan to enter.
