For example, you might need to be able to communicate your research findings to a wide range of audiences, such as colleagues, policymakers, or the general public. Or perhaps you have to collaborate with other scientists across disciplines or manage a team of researchers.\nThese are skills you can develop through self-learning. If you\\u2019re working towards a career in science communication, you can learn the necessary tools and strategies by reading books, watching videos, and participating in online discussions. If you need to collaborate with people from different fields, you can learn the necessary techniques through online courses or even by reading books that describe different approaches.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"You Can Develop Your Knowledge of Your Field\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`You might already be close to reaching the end of your formal education and be ready to start applying for jobs. Or maybe you\\u2019re still in school and want to develop a deeper understanding of your field as you approach graduation.\nWhatever your situation, you can use self-learning to learn more about your specific field of study and its related disciplines. This can help you stand out in interviews and on your resume. For example, if you want to work in environmental science, you can explore related topics such as chemistry and biology to better understand the challenges you\\u2019ll face.

These are all part of the learning process. Working through your mistakes and improving your skills builds your confidence in your abilities.\nFor example, let\\u2019s say you\\u2019re interested in working in environmental science. You might decide to read a few books on chemistry, biology, and geology to explore ways these disciplines are relevant to your field. You might also read a few books on environmental policy and learn about the career challenges facing environmental scientists. As you explore these topics, you\\u2019re bound to encounter things you don\\u2019t know or don\\u2019t understand. This is a normal part of learning, so don\\u2019t let it discourage you.

Once you\\u2019re out of school, your job is to apply that knowledge in real-world scenarios, collaborate with other researchers, and communicate your findings in a way that others can understand and use.\nSelf-learning helps prepare you for all of these challenges.

This is the best way to learn new skills and master them.\nYou can continue to self-learn during your formal education.
