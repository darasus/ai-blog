  products. The majority of businesses spend 80% of their time creating products

  goals. Having a marketing plan in place before starting your business will

intro: "Starting your own business is a challenging and rewarding experience.
  You get to be your own boss, set your own hours, and create something new.
  It’s also scary, challenging, and often times riddled with uncertainty.
  Starting a business requires dedication, hard work, discipline, and stamina.
  In fact, most businesses fail within the first five years of operation.There
  are many reasons why businesses fail. Often it’s because the owners didn’t
  understand the market they were entering or underestimated how much time and
  money it would take to get their company off the ground. Fortunately there are
  things you can do before even setting up a business that will increase your
  chances of success: creating a plan, developing a pitch, researching

## Know Your Audience Before Starting A Business

Before you put any money into starting a business, you need to know who your target audience is. Consumers make purchases based on their needs, wants, and desires. If you don’t understand your audience, how can you expect to sell to them? How will you know if your product or service is the right fit for your market? You can start by asking yourself a few questions. Who do you want to buy your product? Where do they live? What do they do for a living? What are their ages, genders, and incomes? What are their interests and hobbies? What problems do they have that you can solve? What are their pain points? Knowing your audience is essential. It will help you shape your product and marketing strategy. It will help you pick the right location to do business from, and it will help you choose the name of your company.

## Create A Marketing Plan Before Starting A Business

Most new businesses fail because they don’t know how to market their products. The majority of businesses spend 80% of their time creating products and only 20% promoting them. The best way to avoid being one of those statistic is by creating a marketing plan before starting your business. A marketing plan is a written document that outlines your company’s goals, objectives, and strategies for reaching those goals. It outlines the type of marketing you’ll be doing, how much money you’ll spend on it, and how you measure your progress. Creating an effective marketing plan doesn’t have to be hard. You can use a marketing planning worksheet like the one above to guide you through the process. Once you’ve created your marketing plan, you can implement it when you start your business. Having a marketing plan in place before starting your business will save you time, money, and headaches down the road.

## Develop A Pitch

A pitch is a short, dynamic presentation that outlines the who, what, where, why, and how of your business. A good pitch will familiarize potential investors with your company, its goals, and the potential returns on their investments. You can use your pitch to attract investors, partners, and mentors. It’s also a great way to market yourself if you plan on hiring people to work for you. You can use your pitch in a variety of ways including email, face to face presentations, telephone calls, and social media. You can write a pitch in almost any format. It can be a short story, a poem, a screenplay, or even a comic book. The important thing is to summarize your business and its goals in a concise and dynamic way.

## Research The Competition

Before starting a business, you should research the competition. This is especially true if you plan on entering a crowded market. You want to know what your competitors are doing, what products they’re offering, and how you can differentiate yourself from the crowd. You also want to know how much money it will take to compete. Are there other companies who already have a foothold in the market? Do they have a significant advantage over you? What would it take for you to be able to compete with them? Researching the competition will help you to understand the challenges you’ll face as an entrepreneur. It may also give you some ideas for how you can differentiate yourself from the crowd.

## Find Funding Sources Before Starting A Business

Before starting a business, you should identify potential funding sources. This can be in the form of loans, grants, investment, government programs, or another source of capital. Start with your network. Ask family, friends, and colleagues if they have money they’d like to lend or if they know anyone who’d like to invest in your business. You can also research local businesses and government programs that offer funding to start-up companies. There are also a variety of online platforms that connect investors with businesses seeking capital.

## Create An Exit Strategy Before Starting A Business

An exit strategy is your plan for when you want to sell your company. Before starting a business, you should think about when you want to sell it and to whom. You may want to build a company that you plan on passing on to your children, or you may want to sell your company for millions of dollars to start a new company. There are many ways to exit a business, but the most common ways are through an acquisition or an IPO. Having an exit strategy in mind before starting a business will help you to focus on creating a profitable company that someone will want to buy.
