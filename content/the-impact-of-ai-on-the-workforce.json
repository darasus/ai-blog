Every operation we do in our daily lives involves some kind of technology. This can range from how we get to work, to the way we buy and sell goods and services, the sources we use for information and the way we stay in touch with friends and family. Everything has been made easier thanks to technology. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that enables devices or algorithms to act in a human-like manner as observed in humans and animals.\nAI has many practical applications, such as automatically tagging images on social media sites, detecting spam email filters, or self-driving cars. In this blog post, you will learn more about artificial intelligence, its implications on society and potential future implications of AI on jobs and everyday life.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
