In fact, it is an ongoing, never-ending process. It is a way of thinking, an approach to learning and a set of strategies that can be used at any point in time. Self-learning is basically learning how to learn, so that we can continue to grow even after finishing school or university.\nEven adults prefer different methods of learning such as reading books on their own instead of listening to lectures or attending group classes.
