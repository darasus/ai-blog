We research books to read, join workshops and trainings or have mentors to learn from. The list goes on. All these are great ways of learning about the various aspects of personal growth. They push us outside our comfort zones and make us dig deeper into ourselves and analyze where we stand in life. However, there is another type of learning that is just as essential but not discussed much \\u2014 self-learning .\nSelf-learning involves taking control of your own knowledge and abilities and moving from a passive learner to an active one. It involves finding ways to learn more about yourself so that you may improve as a person, understand your strengths and weaknesses, recognize your beliefs, values and goals in life, be constantly aware of what triggers you the most so you can handle those situations better the next time, understand your fears so that you can tackle them head on instead of avoiding them all your life, etc.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
