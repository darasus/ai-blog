summary: The video processing industry uses a variety of tools and technologies
  to get their job done. AI is a type of technology that’s designed to create
  machines that can learn, understand, and create on their own. This is because
  these algorithms are programmed to recognize visual patterns and then make
  predictions based on what they’ve learned. AI can help businesses in this
  industry process more video and images in less time, which can equate to more
  profit for businesses. The most popular AI algorithm for this industry is a
  deep neural network.
intro: >-
  The video processing industry is growing at an astounding rate. This is
  primarily due to the rise of social media and the prevalence of user-generated
  content. As a result, there are now a plethora of video editing apps that
  allow users to add filters to their videos, create green-screen effects, and
  more. Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive.
  However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video
  processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial
  intelligence (AI). 

  If you’re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you’ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we’ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI. Additionally, we’ll explore some common applications of Go for AI and video processing as well as provide examples of programs written in Go that can be used by you if you want to get started sooner rather than later!

## What is the Video Processing Industry?

The video processing industry is any industry that uses video as a creative medium. This can include everything from film production to commercial advertisement production. As you can probably imagine, the video processing industry uses a variety of tools and technologies to get their job done. This includes cameras, editing software, and more.

The video processing industry has been around since the advent of commercial film. Commercial film was first used during the Great Depression as a way to create employment. The industry continued to grow during the 20th century with the development of new technologies, like television and digital video, becoming a major source of revenue for media companies. In recent years, video processing has seen an even larger increase in popularity thanks to the rise of social media and user-generated content.

## Why Does the Video Processing Industry Need AI?

AI is a type of technology that’s designed to create machines that can learn, understand, and create on their own. Put simply, AI is capable of doing things that humans can’t do alone, like processed huge amounts of data quickly, create more intricate designs, and handle tasks that are dangerous or too difficult for humans. It’s common to see machine learning algorithms in applications like image and video processing. This is because these algorithms are programmed to recognize visual patterns and then make predictions based on what they’ve learned. Put simply, image and video processing with AI can help businesses in this industry to process more complex videos and images with ease. This can help increase profit, as companies in this industry tend to charge based on the amount of time and effort used to produce their end product. AI can help companies in this industry process more video and images in less time, which can equate to more profit for businesses.

## Go Language for AI in Video Processing

As we’ve already discussed, image and video processing with AI is incredibly popular in the video processing industry. However, there are plenty of different types of AI algorithms that can be used for image and video processing. The most popular AI algorithm for this industry is a deep neural network. In a nutshell, a deep neural network is a type of computer model that consists of layers of nodes that are connected and are trained to recognize patterns in data. As you can probably imagine, a deep neural network makes image and video processing extremely efficient and accurate.
When it comes to Go programming examples, there are a few popular deep neural network libraries that you can use. One of these libraries is GoogLeNet. This library, which is written in Go, is used for image recognition and classification, and it’s one of the most accurate deep neural networks in existence.
