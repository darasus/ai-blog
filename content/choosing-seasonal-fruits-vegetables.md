When it comes to choosing fruits and vegetables, it’s important to consider what’s in season. Seasonal produce is not only fresher, but it’s also more affordable. Here are some tips for choosing seasonal fruits and vegetables:

1. Check the calendar. Fruits and vegetables have seasons just like everything else. Knowing when produce is in season can help you make the best choices.

5. Enjoy the bounty of each season. Seasonal produce is a great way to enjoy the best that each season has to offer. From summer berries to winter squash, there are many delicious options to choose from.
