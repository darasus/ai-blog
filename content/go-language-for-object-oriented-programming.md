The Go programming language was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.

The Go programming language is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.
