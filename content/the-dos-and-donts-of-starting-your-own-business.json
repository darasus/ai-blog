Even the most experienced founders will often launch a new business and see it fail, sometimes several times over. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the risks involved with launching a startup by testing your idea as early as possible with inexpensive methods.\nStartup failure is an unfortunate but inevitable part of the startup process.
