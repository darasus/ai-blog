One of the easiest ways to figure out your risk tolerance is to ask yourself how you would react to a significant stock market drop.\nWhile no one can predict the future, if you were feeling confident that the market would go back up within a few months, you\\u2019re likely someone who can handle a moderate amount of risk.

This strategy is especially important to consider if you\\u2019re investing in stocks, as there is always the risk that a particular company might not perform as well as planned.\nIn fact, the more investments you spread across, the more likely you are to have a successful portfolio.

Robo-advisors are designed to be super accessible, easy to understand, and hands-off\\u2014meaning the account manager will set up your account according to the risk level you specify and then just sit back and let your money grow over time.\nRobo-advisors are investment accounts that are managed by algorithms. This means that the website will select an investment for you depending on your risk level and goals.\nWhile robo-advisors are great for beginners, it\\u2019s important to remember that you\\u2019re not managing the money yourself.
