Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to speed up your workflow because you don\\u2019t have to take your hands off the keyboard while you are coding. This gives you less time between actions and ultimately makes you more efficient and productive.\nAnother way to create a workflow that is more efficient is by organizing your files.
