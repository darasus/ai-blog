You might work best with a certain software, or you might prefer to work with certain settings.

Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to speed up your workflow because you don\\u2019t have to take your hands off the keyboard while you are coding. This gives you less time between actions and ultimately makes you more efficient and productive.\nAnother way to create a workflow that is more efficient is by organizing your files. Every developer has a different way of organizing their files, but you should always try to be consistent with your file names and folder structures. This will help you in the long run when you are looking for files and putting them away.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Use the most effective coding tools\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Most developers rely heavily on their computers, software, and other tools when coding.

It will also help you to find bugs and mistakes in your code much faster than if you didn\\u2019t do this.\nYou will find that TDD will save you a lot of time and make your workflow much more efficient. You won\\u2019t have to go back and fix bugs or troubleshoot issues as often because you will be writing your code with errors in mind.

This will help you prioritize your work better and complete tasks more quickly.\nOrganizing your files and folders is also very important.

If you want to be able to work as efficiently as possible, you need to be in good health. This is the only way.\nBeing in good health will allow you to concentrate more on your work.
