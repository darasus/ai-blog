A blockchain can be used as a shared virtual ledger to record transactions between two or more parties, enabling them to settle any contractual agreements or financial obligations quickly, easily, and accurately.\nThe Blockchain can also be used to assign digital identities to all the parties involved in your business, which is helpful for controlling who has access to sensitive information. For example, a blockchain could be used to identify employees, business partners, suppliers, customers, and other key stakeholders involved in the operations of your company.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Supply Chain and Inventory Tracking - Blockchain technology can also be used to improve the way you track and maintain inventory. Instead of using a manual system, blockchain can be implemented to track inventory in real time and with increased accuracy.

Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server. Furthermore, we\\u2019ll discuss why blockchain technology is particularly well suited to meet this challenge with enhanced security measures and increased transparency.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself.
