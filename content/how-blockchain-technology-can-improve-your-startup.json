Instead of using a manual system, blockchain can be implemented to track inventory in real time and with increased accuracy.

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary.
