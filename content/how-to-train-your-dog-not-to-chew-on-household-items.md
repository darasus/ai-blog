intro: >-
  Are you ready to give up chewing on household objects? How about your
  dog? Dogs love to chew. It’s something that comes naturally for them, and
  there are many things you can buy or make that will help satisfy their natural
  instincts to chew. But as much as dogs love to have objects that they can gnaw
  on, it’s not always safe – or advisable – to let them do it in the home. There
  are plenty of household items that dogs shouldn’t be allowed to chew, because
  it could lead to potential hazards or unsanitary conditions. 

  Even if your dog has never chewed on inappropriate things before, a new puppy will almost certainly try out things beyond what is safe for him. How you train him from the very beginning will determine how much damage he can do if he goes after something he shouldn’t. So read on and learn how to stop your dog from chewing on anything other than his own toys.

## Before You Start Training

While it’s never too late to start training your dog, you may find that it takes a little longer to retrain him. Be patient and don’t be too hard on yourself if it takes a little time to see results.

If you have more than one dog, it’s best to start training them both at the same time. Even if your dogs are already trained to leave certain items alone, another dog might see them chewing on something and decide he wants to do it too. If you don’t train them both at the same time, you may run into situations where one dog is doing what he should be doing but the other one isn’t.

If you’re training more than one dog at a time, it’s even more important to be patient. You may even want to reduce the amount of items that you allow in the home until the dogs are fully trained. This will reduce the temptation for them to chew on things they shouldn’t.

## Avoiding Chew-Training Mistakes

There are a few mistakes that dogs owners often make when trying to train their dogs not to chew. Before you start training your dog, make sure you avoid these mistakes. Remember that if you don’t correct these errors before you begin training, your dog will learn the wrong things.

- Don’t punish your dog for chewing. This is a normal behavior for dogs – it’s how they learn and explore their world. Punishing your dog for chewing on something he shouldn’t is only going to make him afraid of you, which is the last thing you want.
- Don’t let your dog chew on anything he shouldn’t while you’re training him. This is when you want to really keep your dog’s access to potential chew items as limited as possible. If you let him chew on anything he shouldn’t, he’ll learn that he can chew on anything.
- Don’t assume your dog knows the difference between the right and wrong things to chew. Just because he’s never chewed on the couch, doesn’t mean he knows that it’s a bad thing to do. Dogs learn through repetition, just like humans.

## Key Steps To Train Your Dog Not To Chew

There are several steps to follow as you train your dog not to chew. Make sure you cover all of them so you don’t miss anything important.

- Start by managing your dog’s environment. Make sure you close off areas that aren’t appropriate for dogs (like the kitchen), and keep the areas that are appropriate for dogs closed off. Make sure you put away anything that could be dangerous for your dog to chew on, like electrical wires or shoes.
- Praise and reward your dog for chewing on his own toys. This will help reinforce good behavior. Be careful not to reward him with something he shouldn’t be chewing on, though. If he gets into a pair of shoes and chews them up, that’s still rewarding him for chewing on shoes.
- Correct your dog for chewing on things he shouldn’t. You want to make sure he knows that chewing on the wrong things is not acceptable.
- Use a word or phrase to let your dog know the item he is chewing on is off-limits. The word “no” probably isn’t enough. You want your dog to know exactly what he is doing wrong.

## Train Your Dog Outdoors

If your dog has ever chewed on something indoors, take him outside and let him know that he can only chew on his toys on the grass. Dogs naturally keep their dens clean, so they don’t like to have dirt and other things inside. Dogs are also very observant of their surroundings, so he will notice that grass doesn’t make its way inside his mouth.

## Teach Your Dog The “Off” Command

If there are items that you absolutely don’t want your dog to chew on, you can teach him to “off” those items. This is helpful for items that your dog might even be tempted to chew on, but you don’t want him to. This can be something like a table leg or a curtain. Start by having your dog on a leash and having him near the item you want him to ignore. When he starts to chew on it, give him a short yelp and then pull him away from the item. Then reward him for not chewing on it. You may have to do this several times, but it’s important that you correct your dog for chewing on anything he shouldn’t.

## Make The Items You Don’t Want Chewed Unattractive Or Repulsive

If there are certain items that you don’t want your dog to chew on, but you don’t want to put him at risk by trying to spray them with something. Instead, you can make them unattractive or repulsive to him by doing a few things.

- Put a bitter apple or grape spray on the items you don’t want your dog to chew on.
- Wrap the items in aluminum foil. Your dog won’t be able to get a grip on the item and will lose interest in chewing on it.
- You can also make the items taste bad with hot sauce or cayenne pepper.

## Put Together A Reward Program

Rewards aren’t just for humans. Training your dog to stop chewing on the things he shouldn’t be chewing on should be a reward-based process. You want to make sure that your dog knows that he’s doing the right thing. Make sure you have plenty of healthy treats on hand so you can reward your dog for making the right choices. If you want to use things that aren’t food-based, make sure they’re safe for your dog. Keep in mind that you want to reward your dog for making the right choices, not just chewing on his own toys. He’ll need to know that it’s OK for him to chew on his toys, but not on the things in your house that he doesn’t belong chewing on.

## Conclusion

Dogs love to chew, but they don’t always love chewing on their own toys. As much as you want your dog to enjoy his toys, you also want to make sure he’s chewing on things that are safe for him and your home. To train your dog to stop chewing on household items, you need to start early and be consistent with your training. Be patient with your dog, and don’t be too hard on yourself if it takes a little time for him to learn what he’s supposed to do. That’s the real challenge, right?
