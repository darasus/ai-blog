Assuming you would like a tips-based article: 

1. Start with basic obedience commands such as sit, stay, come, and down. As your dog masters these commands, you will be able to better train them on specific behaviors.

2. If your dog is chewing on household items, provide them with appropriate chew toys. This will help redirect their chewing behavior and give them an outlet for their chewing needs.

3. Be consistent with your commands and rewards. Dogs respond best to consistent training, so make sure you are using the same commands and providing the same rewards each time.

4. Be patient and remain calm during training. Dogs can sense when their owners are angry or frustrated, so it is important to remain calm during the training process.

5. Have realistic expectations for your dog. Some dogs will never be 100% perfect when it comes to chewing, so it is important to set realistic goals for your dog's behavior.
