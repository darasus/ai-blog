summary: Go is an easy-to-use programming language that is a great choice for
  network administrators. The language has been designed to make it easier to
  write reliable code that can be read by anyone on the team. Go was designed by
  Google in 2007 as an alternative to more traditional languages such as C and
  C++. It was created as a response to the growing complexity of these languages
  and the difficulty of finding developers who could work in them. The main
  advantage that network administrators get from using Go is that it is easy to
  use reliable code.
intro: >-
  Keeping a network running smoothly and efficiently is challenging, even
  for network administrators with years of experience. The best network
  administrators manage to plan for the future by anticipating problems from the
  present and creating plans to deal with them before they arise. However, this
  can be difficult when working in a fast-paced industry with so much change
  happening at once. 

  In response to this challenge, Go—a simple programming language developed by Google that makes it easier to create software packages—is gaining traction as an ideal tool for creating programs for operating and managing computer networks. Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.

  Go is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It’s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques. If you’re interested in using Go to make your career as a network administrator easier or even transition into becoming one, read on for more information about why you should learn Go for Network Administration and the best places to get started with your learning today!

## What Is Go?

Go is a programming language that was designed by Google in 2007 as an alternative to more traditional languages such as C and C++. It was created as a response to the growing complexity of these languages and the difficulty of finding developers who could work in them.
The design of Go was inspired by previous languages, such as C and Pascal. It was intended to be easy to read and understand, even for developers who were not experienced with programming. The designers of Go also wanted the language to be able to handle the huge scale of Google’s infrastructure. Go was designed to be statically typed, which means that each variable is assigned a type when the program is written and cannot be changed. This makes it easier to catch mistakes when a program is written.

## Why Should Network Administrators Learn Go?

Go is a simple language that’s designed to solve a very specific set of problems. To make sure that it only solves these problems and doesn’t also introduce new ones, the language is kept as simple as possible. This simplicity is what makes it such a great choice for network administrators.
The main advantage that network administrators get from using Go is that it is easy to write reliable code. The language has been designed so that the majority of bugs that cause systems to crash or behave unexpectedly are caught by the compiler or the type system. This means that the chance of your code breaking once it’s been deployed is much lower, which makes it a great choice for long-term software projects.
If you’re a network administrator, this is great news as you’ll spend less time debugging and more time deploying features that help your users.

## How Can Network Administrators Use Go?

Go is an open source language, so anyone can use it for free. There are public repositories where network administrators can find other people’s code and pieces of code that they can use in their own projects.
When you’re writing code in Go, you can share it with other people using a hosting service called GitHub. People can then use your code in their projects by simply adding a few lines to their code and typing “import ” at the top of the file.
You can also use Go to create programs that run on your computer instead of a server. This can be done by creating a binary file that can be run directly on your computer. You can then distribute this file to other people who can run it on their computers.

## The Best Way To Learn Go Is…

Like any new skill, learning to code in Go takes time and practice. However, if you want to get the most out of your learning experience, you should consider joining a coding bootcamp or taking an online course. Bootcamps offer more immediate feedback on your progress and help you to build a network of like-minded individuals that can support you long after the course ends.
Additionally, many bootcamps offer scholarships or other financial aid if you show that network administration is your career goal. Online courses are also a great way to accelerate your learning process and make sure that you’re learning the right skills. However, you should make sure that the course you choose is designed for network administrators and offers ongoing support from instructors.

## Final Words

Go is an easy-to-use, easy-to-read programming language that is a great choice for network administrators. It has been designed to make it easier to write reliable code that can be read by anyone on the team.
