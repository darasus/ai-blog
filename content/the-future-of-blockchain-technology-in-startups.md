summary: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure,
  peer-to-peer transfer of data. It can be used for supply chain management,
  smart contracts, online voting, insurance claim settlement, digital rights
  management, and real estate transactions. It's a new technology with a lot of
  potential, and it will take time for businesses and investors to understand
  how to use it effectively. The technology is new, it is unregulated and
  doesn’t have a proven track record like other technologies like AI.
intro: >-
  In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of buzz around
  blockchain technology and its potential use cases. We have seen numerous
  companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as
  healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great
  news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious
  about blockchain-based startups. 

  Not just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones. 

  But that doesn’t mean it’s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself. Read on to find out more.

## What is Blockchain Technology?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, peer-to-peer transfer of data. It is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. This technology is primarily used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zcash. But blockchain has many other use cases as well. For example, it can be used for supply chain management, smart contracts, online voting, insurance claim settlement, digital rights management, and real estate transactions.

A blockchain consists of nodes that are connected to each other via a network. These nodes keep a record of all the transactions that occur in the system and are verified by the nodes. A blockchain network can be permissionless, permissioned, or a hybrid of the two. In a permissionless network, nobody approves or rejects transactions. On the other hand, in a permissioned network, only a pre-selected set of nodes can approve or reject transactions.

## Why Blockchain Isn’t Just About Bitcoin?

Blockchain technology has become synonymous with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it’s so much more than that. In fact, many people don’t even understand how it works. But to be fair, if we look back in history, we will see that the internet wasn’t designed for the kind of business that it’s now used for. It took time and the right technology to create effective business models, just like the internet. The same is true for blockchain. It’s a new technology with a lot of potential, and it will take time for businesses and investors to understand how to use it effectively.

## 5 Key Benefits of Using Blockchain in Startups

It Provides Transparency - As blockchain runs on a distributed network, it is transparent and secure. This ensures that all stakeholders can view the data and transactions, thereby bringing in transparency. You don’t have to trust one central authority as the data is verified by nodes across the network. That’s why it is increasingly being used by industries such as healthcare and real estate to bring in trust and transparency.

Faster and Cheaper Transactions - Blockchain is peer-to-peer, meaning that there is no need for a centralized authority to conduct the transactions. This brings in a trust-free, cost-effective, and faster settlement of transactions.

Strong Security - This is one of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology for businesses. Using encryption and cryptography, blockchain secures the data and transactions. Nobody, not even the miners can access the data without proper permission.

## 3 Major Challenges for Blockchain Technology in Startups

Risk of Being Overwhelmed by the Competition - Though blockchain startups are on the rise, there are already several big players in the market such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. The technology giants have already started investing in the technology and have launched some promising products. This puts blockchain startups at an inherent disadvantage. Investors prefer investing in startups over large corporations. But if they see that blockchain startups are losing the race against these giants, they won’t invest.

Regulatory Hurdles - Blockchain startups face regulatory challenges because of the unregulated nature of the technology. The lack of proper regulations puts blockchain startups at risk of using the technology illegally. If a blockchain startup wants to launch an ICO, it has to comply with the SEC rules. If it doesn’t, it will be shut down. But this is something that many startups don’t want to do because it brings in regulation and impacts the business model.

Lack of Trust among Investors - After the Bitcoin crash, investors are wary of investing in blockchain startups. The technology is new, it is unregulated and doesn’t have a proven track record like other technologies like AI. This has made investors very cautious about investing in blockchain startups.

## How can startups leverage blockchain technology?

As we discussed in the previous section, blockchain technology offers a lot of benefits for businesses. It can bring in trust, transparency, faster and cheaper transactions, and increased security. If you are planning to invest in a blockchain-based startup or are currently working on one, here are a few things to keep in mind.

Start with the problem - Before starting to implement blockchain technology, you have to first decide the problem that you are trying to solve. Blockchain, like any other technology, is not a solution to every business problem. You have to find the right use case to implement blockchain and solve the problem.

Define the solution - Once you have identified the problem, you have to define the solution. What is the exact problem that you are trying to solve? How are you going to implement blockchain technology to solve the problem? What are the business and technical requirements?

Get Feedback - Once you have a draft idea about how you want to implement blockchain, you should get feedback from blockchain experts, investors, and potential customers. This will help you improve the product and gain confidence about the product.

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology is still in its infancy stage and has plenty of room to grow. It’s still premature to say that it won’t be useful for businesses anymore. As we have discussed in this post, it has great potential and can solve various problems in many industries.

If you are an entrepreneur or an investor, you shouldn’t be worried about investing in blockchain-based startups. If you are careful about the problems that the business is solving and the right use case for blockchain, you can easily tackle the challenges that come with investing in blockchain.
