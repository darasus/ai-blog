After two decades in the music business, Death Cab for Cutie have developed into one of the most beloved bands in indie rock.\nAfter their last album, Codes and Keys (2012), frontman Ben Gibbard announced that he was working on a solo project called The New Age. It was something he had been thinking about for some time but wasn\\u2019t sure when or if it would come to fruition. Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place. The album came out as a collaborative release between Ben Gibbard and Nathan Wiley under the name The Further Adventures of New Age. And three years later Death Cab For Cutie released Thank You For Today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
