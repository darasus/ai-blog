Ego is one of the main things that drives Riggan throughout the film. Fame can bring happiness in the short term, but it isn’t something that lasts, especially in the long term.

However, that doesn\\u2019t mean there hasn\\u2019t been some brilliant albums released so far this year. While last year had some incredible albums (like Kendrick Lamar\\u2019s \\u201CDamn,\\u201D Lorde\\u2019s \\u201CMelodrama,\\u201D and Noel Gallagher\\u2019s High Flying Birds' \"Who Built the Moon?\"), this year hasn\\u2019t quite matched up to those standards. However, we are only halfway through the year and as such, we have also seen some fantastic new albums released in the last few months that are worth mentioning. There may not be many great new albums out at the moment \\u2013 but these five are definitely among the best.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

From \"Stand by Me\" to \"Superbad,\" there are countless stories about adolescents transitioning from innocent children into independent adults. However, it is almost unheard of for a film to capture the nuances and absurdities of growing up as effectively as Richard Linklater\\u2019s \\u201CBoyhood.\\u201D The movie documents 12 years in the life of Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane) and his family through a series of carefully crafted vignettes that document the everyday minutiae of life without being clich\\xE9 or cloying.\nLike so many movies about kids growing up, \"Boyhood\" begins with young Mason being uprooted from his home in Texas and forced to migrate to new cities as he grows older. What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives. The result is something like a documentary on human development \\u2014 funny, sad, awkward, and everything in between \\u2014 presented through the lens of an intimate cinematic experience.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
