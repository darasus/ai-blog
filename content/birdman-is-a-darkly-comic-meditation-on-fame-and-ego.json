  "title": "\"Birdman\" is a darkly comic meditation on fame and ego",
  "summary": "One of the central themes of \"Birdman\" is the search for authenticity in his work, relationships and his life as a whole. Ego is one of the main things that drives Riggan throughout the film. Fame can bring happiness in the short term, but it isn’t something that lasts, especially in the long term. It can also be detrimental to one’s creativity, as fame can create a fear of failure that stifles the creative process. Being famous is not a prerequisite for living a happy and fulfilling life, as it can lead to envy, isolation and privacy.",
  "intro": "In a city that’s been taken over by media, sports and finance moguls, the theater community is feeling squeezed out. As the struggle to find funding and recognition continues, an aging actor challenges his fellow actors to step out of their comfort zone and audition for a new play that he’s producing called “The Birdman.” But as they say, beware of Greeks bearing gifts because this one is also an insider who has ulterior motives. \nIn Alejandro González Iñárritu’s darkly comic film “Birdman,” the lead character—an arrogant actor named Riggan Thomson—is simultaneously tormented by his past success as the superhero Birdman but also driven by the desire for fame again. As a result, he devises a plan to create publicity for his production of The Birdman by playing both roles in the same play and switching back and forth in front of an audience. He also moves into the derelict theater with his daughter where he will perform as part of his preparations on getting back into shape.\nIn exploring these themes of egotism and desperation in a celebrity-obsessed world, \"Birdman\" is an interesting exploration of what it means to be famous and why we allow others to have such power over us.",
  "content": "## The Importance of Being Famous\n\nIn a society that is focused on fame above all else, it’s easy to see how ego can create an unhealthy obsession with attaining fame. The world around us is obsessed with the lives of celebrities and their glamorous lifestyles, so it’s easy to view fame as the ultimate goal.\n\nThe problem with this is that fame is a fleeting thing. While it can bring happiness in the short term, it’s usually followed by a feeling of emptiness. There are only a few people in the world who can truly say that they have found true happiness through fame.\n\nBeing famous is not a prerequisite for living a happy and fulfilling life. In fact, it can even be harmful as it can lead to envy, isolation and a lack of privacy. It can also be detrimental to one’s creativity, as fame can create a fear of failure that stifles the creative process.\n\n## The Search for Authenticity and Self-Discovery\n\nOne of the central themes of \"Birdman\" is the search for authenticity. Riggan, who is the protagonist of the story, is trying to find authenticity in his work, his relationships and his life as a whole. Coming from a past of soap opera acting, Broadway and being the superhero Birdman, Riggan is trying to find authenticity in all aspects of himself. He’s trying to find out what he really wants to do in his life, which is directing and writing.\n\nIn terms of relationships, we see that he’s trying to find authenticity with his daughter, Sam, and his ex-wife, Sylvia. He’s trying to get his daughter to like him and have a relationship with her. He’s also trying to get back together with his ex-wife, who is the mother of his daughter. This is all because he wants to find authenticity in his life.\n\n## Ego and Fear\n\nAnother common theme in \"Birdman\" is the ego and fear. Ego is one of the main things that drives Riggan throughout the film. He has an ego that is so strong that he’s a Broadway actor, writes and directs his own play and tries to start a new career as a Hollywood actor. He also has a very extreme case of imposter syndrome, which is caused by a lack of self-confidence, which is very much seen in the film.\n\nFear is another common theme in the film. Riggan is afraid of failing at everything. He is afraid of failing at his Broadway show, being a Hollywood actor, getting back together with his ex-wife, getting along with his daughter, and being rejected by the public. He is so full of fear that he is unable to function normally in life, and this leads him to do some very irrational things.\n\n## Money, Fame and Happiness\n\nMoney and fame can be considered two of the three things that make people happy. While money can buy happiness in the short term, it’s fleeting, and it doesn’t last. Fame can also bring happiness in the short term, but it isn’t something that lasts, especially in the long term.\n\nThe one thing that will make people happy above all else is finding a passion in life and doing something that they love. Passion can’t be bought, and it can lead to a long-lasting happiness. It can also lead to fame, but it’s a much better option than pursuing fame in itself.\n\n## How to Deal With Our Egos\n\nThe first step in dealing with a strong ego is recognizing that it exists. It’s important to recognize when the ego is causing you to make irrational decisions, and it’s also important to recognize when your ego is helping you to be confident and successful. The next step is to be aware of when your ego is causing problems, and try to correct those issues.\n\nFinally, it’s important to surround yourself with people who challenge your ego, as this can help you to overcome your insecurities. While it’s important to have confidence in yourself, it’s also important to be humble. The best way to deal with a strong ego is to keep it in check, and be grateful for all the good things that have come your way.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis film poses an interesting question about what it means to be famous, and whether it really brings happiness. It also explores the importance of being authentic and finding your passion, and the dangers of ego. With this in mind, it’s important to stay grounded and keep your ego in check to avoid falling prey to unhealthy obsession with fame."
