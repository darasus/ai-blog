The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure. Here are some of our favorite tracks from HAIM's 'Something To Tell You' Album:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama.
