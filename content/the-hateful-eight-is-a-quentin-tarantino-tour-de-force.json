Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends).

Today, there are more ways than ever to access and enjoy hip-hop music; from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to video sharing sites like YouTube, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Rather than any superficial discussion of how many different kinds of people there are or whether one kind is better than another, it is an examination of what it means to be an individual in society by exploring the challenges that arise when one appears to be something they are not.\nThe plot follows the life and loves of two women; poor southern waitress Nora (Lilac) and her daughter Sarah who is being raised by her business-minded father George (Thomas). Nora\\u2019s light-skinned daughter falls for local boy Harry (Swayze), who does not know she also has darker blood. Meanwhile, George falls for Vida (Stapleton), a rich blonde socialite who will only marry him if he passes as white.\nImitation of Life offers commentary on racial identity, classism and even pansexuality through these characters, providing insight into their experiences and highlighting inequality wherever it exists.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
