  "summary": "There are only a handful of scenes with any action in them, three of which are significant for the context of one of the film’s themes, a fourth of which is a brief but memorable stage show. The Hateful Eight is an ensemble film, a film with a large number of characters and subplots, but also features some characters who are not central to the plot. The main story, though, is about two men – a bounty hunter who must find and kill another man, a man who must survive and find a way to save his dead friend's family. Despite the fact that the film is about race and racism, almost nobody in the movie is actually racist.",

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved.
