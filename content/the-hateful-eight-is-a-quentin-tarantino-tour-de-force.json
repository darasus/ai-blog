Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

As a result, he devises a plan to create publicity for his production of The Birdman by playing both roles in the same play and switching back and forth in front of an audience. He also moves into the derelict theater with his daughter where he will perform as part of his preparations on getting back into shape.\nIn exploring these themes of egotism and desperation in a celebrity-obsessed world, \"Birdman\" is an interesting exploration of what it means to be famous and why we allow others to have such power over us.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Maybe it\\u2019s the pressure to impress both new listeners and old fans, or simply the natural progression of any band that leaves them feeling eager to experiment. Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.
