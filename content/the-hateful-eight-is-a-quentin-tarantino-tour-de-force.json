The Hateful Eight is an ensemble film, a film with a large number of characters and subplots, but also features some characters who are not central to the plot.

The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure. Here are some of our favorite tracks from HAIM's 'Something To Tell You' Album:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
