intro: >-
  It’s been almost three years since we heard new music from HAIM, the
  sister trio from Calabasas that burst onto the music scene in 2014 with their
  debut album ‘Days Are Gone.’ 

  With their sophomore album, ‘Something to Tell You,’ HAIM continues to be optimistic and uplifting with their new music. The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters’ harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen. 

  The trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; “Right Now,” “New York Excuse” and “Sentimentality.” 

  And after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year. 

  Luckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure. Here are some of our favorite tracks from HAIM's 'Something To Tell You' Album:

## Something to Tell You

This song is the perfect introduction to HAIM’s new EP. The lyrics and harmonies are smooth and soft, with a subtle beat behind it. The song is about being in love and being certain that the person you’re with is the person you want and need in your life.

## Want You Back

This song is reminiscent of HAIM’s first album, ‘Days Are Gone.’ It’s a blend of synth pop, R&B and a little bit of rock and roll. This song is about wanting someone who has left to come back. It’s about hoping that the person you love is missing you and wants you back in their life and in their heart.

## Little of Your Love

This is another slower track from the album, featuring the lyrics “I need a little of your love/ I don’t need everything you’ve got/ I just need a little of your love.” The song is about needing someone in your life and only wanting a little of their love, as opposed to needing everything they have. It’s about wanting everything and nothing at the same time.

## Ready for You

This is one of the more upbeat songs on the album and the first single released before the EP was released. The lyrics are extremely catchy and easy to memorize, even after only listening to it once. This song is about being ready for the person you love and being ready to be with them and commit to them. It’s about knowing that you’re ready for that special person in your life.

## Running For Your Life

This is another slower track from the album that has a more R&B vibe. This is a passionate track about not being ready to commit to someone and wanting to run from them. The song is from the point of view of someone who is not ready to fully commit to another person and is running from them.

## Don’t Give up Your Daydream

This upbeat track is the last song on the album. It’s about not being ready to give up your dreams and to keep going even if you’ve hit a few bumps along the way. It’s about staying optimistic even when things aren’t going as planned. This is a great message to send out to all the smudges out there. Keep fighting and don’t give up!

## Together

This is the last track on the album (and the first track on the album that isn’t a full-length song). It’s a beautiful track about staying optimistic and being with someone who you love. It’s about finding the person you love and being with them even when everything else seems to be going wrong.

## Through It All

This is another slower track from the album. It’s about being in a relationship and going through everything together. It’s about being with someone who you love and being with them through good times and bad.

## Epilogue: Yearning

This is the last song on the album. It’s about wanting someone and knowing that you’re not ready for a relationship. It’s about being drawn to someone but not being able to be with them because you aren’t ready to fully commit. What to expect? 
This album is full of catchy tunes, strong harmonies and lots of optimism. If you’re looking for a new album to add to your collection, you should definitely give HAIM’s 'Something to Tell You' a listen.
