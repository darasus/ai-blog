summary: The album opens with “You Never Know,” and we see HAIM has matured and
  grown a bit since their last album. “Running For Your Life” is a song that is
  about both a breakup, and the fragility of life. “Push Me Down” may be about a
  breakup. It is also a love song in which one person misses an ex-partner very
  much very much. ‘Kept Me Crying’ is a vulnerable and honest ballad about love
  and heartbreak.

## The Good Stuff

There are many highlights throughout this album, but here are a few of our favourites. “You Don’t Miss Your Water” is a funky, nostalgic throwback to the ‘90s. The chorus is so smooth and groovy, and the lyrics are reminiscent of the Spice Girls-esque girl power of the ‘90s pop culture. This track is the perfect follow-up to “Want You Back,” which is also reminiscent of the ‘90s. “Nothing’s Wrong” is a sweet acoustic love song that proves there are no hard feelings between HAIM and ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, who wrote the lyrics to their previous single. “Kept Me Crying” is a vulnerable and honest ballad about love and heartbreak. “Right Now” is a funky, infectious track that will have you grooving in your seat from the first chorus.

## Gone Now

This song also serves as a love letter of sorts to their home city of Los Angeles, which may have been dealt a few blows lately. “Found a New Moment” is all about living in the moment and enjoying life. We hope that HAIM finds happiness and continues to make great music! “My Promise” is a touching song that lets us know that while HAIM has evolved as a band, they have not forgotten the fans who have been with them since the beginning.

## To My Dear Sister

As the final track on the album, “To My Dear Sister” is a letter to HAIM’s youngest sister, Este, who is a drummer in the band. The sisters have always written songs to and for each other, and this album is no different. On this track, Este sings about growing up, feeling like an outsider, and feeling inadequate compared to her sisters. She also sings about the need to stay true to who you are no matter what others may think of you. We hope Este feels like she’s “enough” and that she knows she is loved and valued.

HAIM once again proves that they are one of the most endearing pop acts in the industry. We’re excited to see what comes next for this talented trio. We hope you enjoy listening to this album as much as we did!
