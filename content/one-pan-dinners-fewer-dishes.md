intro: >-
  If you’re anything like us, you probably dread doing the dishes after a
  long day. Why? Because doing the dishes is one of the most time-consuming and
  tedious chores we have in our homes. That’s why we’ve discovered ways to
  reduce that dreaded task and make it as painless as possible.

  Now that we’re all living together again after going off to college, we’ve introduced a lot of new habits as roommates. One of our favorites is learning how to make one pan dinners on nights when everyone has somewhere to be after dinner. It means less time in the kitchen and fewer dishes to clean later on!

## Why we love one pan dinners

There are many reasons why we love to make one pan dinners:

- Fewer dishes - We’ve all been there. You’re tired after a long day at work or school, and all you want to do is relax and veg out on the couch. After a long day, the last thing you want to do is spend an hour or two washing dishes, especially if you have to do it alone. But if you make a one pan dinner, you won’t have to spend any time cleaning up afterwards.
- Quicker preparation - While one pan dinners take a bit more time to cook than some other types of dinners, the upfront time it takes to prepare these dishes is often significantly less. This means that, for example, you can prepare a one pan dinner for when your significant other comes home from work at a time that’s convenient for both of you.
- Reduced energy usage - One pan dinners often use only one burner or one oven tray, which means that you don’t have to use all of your burners or trays. This is great if you only have two burners or two trays because it means that you can still make a one pan dinner while keeping another burner or tray free for other things.

## How to make a one pan dinner

If you’ve ever made a one pan dinner recipe before, then you know that there’s no one way to make these. There are, however, some general tips and tricks to make sure that the results are delicious.

- Choose a recipe - You might be wondering how to make a one pan dinner if you don’t have a recipe to follow. The good news is that there are many recipes out there for one pan dinners, so you have plenty of options.
- Select your ingredients - Once you’ve chosen a recipe, pick out your ingredients. Make sure that you only buy as much as you need, though.
- Prepare your ingredients - Once you have all of your ingredients, you’ll want to start preparing them. Depending on what you’re making, this could mean chopping vegetables, searing meat, or both.
- Prepare your pan - While you’re chopping and searing your ingredients, you’ll want to begin preheating your pan. You don’t want to add your ingredients to a cold pan, or they’ll stick to it and become a huge mess.
- Add your ingredients to the pan - Once your pan is hot and your ingredients are ready, begin adding your ingredients to the pan. Depending on what you’re making, you may want to add your ingredients to the pan in a certain order. For example, if you’re searing meat, you’ll want to add it to the pan first.
- Add liquids - After you’ve added your ingredients to the pan, you may want to add any liquids to the pan. This could be anything from water to wine.
