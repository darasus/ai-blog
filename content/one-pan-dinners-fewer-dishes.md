## Why we love one pan dinners

There are many reasons why we love to make one pan dinners:

- Fewer dishes - We’ve all been there. You’re tired after a long day at work or school, and all you want to do is relax and veg out on the couch. After a long day, the last thing you want to do is spend an hour or two washing dishes, especially if you have to do it alone. But if you make a one pan dinner, you won’t have to spend any time cleaning up afterwards.
- Quicker preparation - While one pan dinners take a bit more time to cook than some other types of dinners, the upfront time it takes to prepare these dishes is often significantly less. This means that, for example, you can prepare a one pan dinner for when your significant other comes home from work at a time that’s convenient for both of you.
- Reduced energy usage - One pan dinners often use only one burner or one oven tray, which means that you don’t have to use all of your burners or trays. This is great if you only have two burners or two trays because it means that you can still make a one pan dinner while keeping another burner or tray free for other things.
