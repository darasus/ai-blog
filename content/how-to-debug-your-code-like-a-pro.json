Well, if that sounds like you \\u2014 as a programmer \\u2014 then keep reading because we have some good news for you! Debugging your code is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks as a coder. It requires patience, precision, and analytical skills to identify where things aren\\u2019t working correctly and why.
