There are literally thousands of programming languages in existence today. Some are general-purpose programming languages that can be used for a variety of applications. Others are more niche, focusing on becoming an expert in one particular domain.\nThat last category is where you might find yourself when looking for a new language for network programming. These are programming languages that have been designed with specific domains in mind, such as networking or computer telephony. You might think there isn\\u2019t much scope for differentiation between these specialist programming languages, but there\\u2019s plenty out there!\nIf you\\u2019re still struggling to decide which is the best Go Programming Language for Networking, don\\u2019t worry! We have created this short blog post with all the information you need to make an informed decision about your future studies! Read on to get acquainted with five of the most common network programming languages and their unique benefits:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
