Imagine this, you need to run a report every day and it takes 5 minutes each time. You could either set an alarm and rush back to the desk in 5 minutes or create a script to automate this process. The latter leaves more time for you to focus on more important things. What if you could automate even the simplest tasks? Wouldn\\u2019t it free up your time for better things? That\\u2019s where Python comes into play. As an automation scripting language, it can help you automate even the simplest of tasks and free up more time for work that matters. Automation helps businesses in many ways. It saves time, increases efficiency and decreases costs by eliminating manual processes. In this blog, we will explore why Python is such a popular programming language for system automation and how it can be used to automate simple repetitive tasks in your organization.
