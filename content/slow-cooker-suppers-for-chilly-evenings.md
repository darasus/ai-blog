## What should you put in your slow cooker?

The beauty of slow cookers is that you can put almost anything in it and it will be delicious at the end of the day. However, there are certain ingredients that work particularly well in a slow cooker, and it’s worth experimenting with these to find the best flavours for your taste buds.

- Red meat - This is best cooked on low in the slow cooker, so it’s perfect for long, slow cooking to make tender and juicy meat dishes like stews and casseroles.
- Poultry - Chicken and turkey also work well in the slow cooker, cooked on high to make dishes like curries, soups, and casseroles.
- Beans and pulses - These are perfect for the slow cooker because they can sit in liquid for hours without becoming mushy or breaking down.
- Vegetables and grains - Vegetable-based stews, puddings, and casseroles work well in the slow cooker, as do delicate grains like rice, barley, and quinoa.
