summary: JavaScript is a programming language used for client-side web
  scripting. TypeScript is an open-source tool created by Microsoft that adds
  strong typing and object-oriented programming capabilities to JavaScript. It
  brings many of the programming benefits of languages like C++, Java, and C# to
  the world of JavaScript development. With TypeScript, software developers can
  write more reliable code, and improve the overall experience for their end
  users. The TypeScript programming language is a superset of JavaScript that
  compiles to unmodified JavaScript.
intro: >-
  Are you confused about the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript?
  Do you know which of these programming languages is right for your project? If
  so, read on to learn more!

  In this blog post, we’ll go over everything you need to know about TypeScript vs. JavaScript. Both of these programming languages are popular in the software development industry. However, they have some subtle yet important differences that set them apart from one another. 

  But first, before we dive into the details of each programming language, let’s understand what they both have in common. 

  Both JavaScript and TypeScript are dynamic, object-oriented programming languages designed for creating websites and other interactive applications. They both support curly bracket syntax with optional semicolons, as well > operators for type checking, and if-else conditional statements. Both support variables, data types (string, boolean, number), and function calls with optional arguments and return values.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used for client-side web scripting. It was created in the early 1990s and has since undergone several major revisions. It is currently standardized as ECMAScript.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used for many purposes, from website functionality to data analysis and artificial intelligence. JavaScript is a very easy language to learn, and you can find it in almost every computing device that is connected to the internet.

JavaScript is commonly used to build dynamic web content and handle user actions on web pages by receiving input from the user. It can also be used to create desktop applications.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language that is designed to compile into JavaScript. It is a superset of the JavaScript language that can be used to write applications for any browser or host operating system.

The TypeScript programming language is an open-source tool created by Microsoft that adds strong typing and object-oriented programming capabilities to JavaScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to unmodified JavaScript. It brings many of the programming benefits of languages like C++, Java, and C# to the world of JavaScript development. With TypeScript, software developers can write more reliable code, and improve the overall experience for their end users.

## Differences between JavaScript and TypeScript

Let’s start by looking at the key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript.

Strong Typing : TypeScript adds strong typing to JavaScript. This means that it provides the developer with more information about the code, making it easier to fix potential bugs.

Improved Code readability : TypeScript’s syntax is designed to improve code readability and avoid common syntax errors. As a result, TypeScript code is easier to understand and maintain.

Improved Tooling : TypeScript provides better tooling support. With TypeScript, developers can use a number of tools for code analysis and visualization.

Standards : TypeScript is compatible with ECMAScript standards. This means that the compiled code can be executed in any browser, and it is also easy to integrate with other JavaScript applications.

## Benefits of Using TypeScript

As mentioned above, TypeScript brings some key advantages to the JavaScript development ecosystem. To recap, these advantages include:

Strong Typing - TypeScript uses static typing to give you meaningful error messages when you make a mistake. This enables you to catch bugs earlier and refactor code more confidently.

Better Tooling - TypeScript is also compiled into JavaScript. This means that it plays well with other tools and can be used with any JavaScript code.

Standards - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means that it’s easy to integrate with any other JavaScript libraries and frameworks, while still adding new functionality.

## How to Use TypeScript?

Now that we’ve explored the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript, it’s time to learn how to use TypeScript.

To use TypeScript, you first need to install a TypeScript compiler. This compiler will generate a JavaScript file from your TypeScript code. The easiest way to install a TypeScript compiler is to install an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
There are many different features available in TypeScript. However, the most important ones are: Types, Functions, Classes, Modules, and Interfaces.

Types - Types provide the compiler with extra information about the variables. This enables the compiler to detect bugs and improve the tooling experience.

Functions - Functions are a way to organize chunks of code and avoid code repetition. Functions can be used as a way to pass data to a piece of code and even return data from it.

## Final Words

Now that you know the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript, you can decide which language is best for your project!

If you’re planning to build a large or complex application, then TypeScript is likely the right choice. It’s a more advanced version of JavaScript that adds strong typing, a larger set of built-in functions, and code validation to your application.
