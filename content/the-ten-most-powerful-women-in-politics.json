Women also account for just 24 percent of state legislators, 28 percent of city council members, and 15 percent of mayors.\nTo make matters more challenging, this imbalance is not only apparent but also more pronounced in the political sphere than in any other industry. In business management, for example, women hold almost half (44%) of executive roles . But in government? They account for less than one-fifth (19%) of state legislators, city council members, and mayors combined.\nAs a result, when it comes to women in politics we often see a lopsided list that skews toward white cisgender able-bodied wealthy educated privileged women who look very little like the rest of us.
