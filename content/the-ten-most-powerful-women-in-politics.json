Since the referendum results were announced in June 2016, businesses have been adapting to this new reality.\nWith only a year left until the official exit date of March 29, 2019, many companies are taking action now to mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities. The industry-specific challenges and potential opportunities regarding Brexit are different for every company. Some businesses may need to make changes to their products, services or supply chain; others may need to make strategic hires; while still others must manage employee anxiety about job security.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After the failure of the European Constitution in 2005, and following several years of financial crisis, EU institutions and member states have recommitted to strengthening the foundations of European integration. Indeed, a new wave of integration has emerged.\nIn recent years, we have seen a renewed political will among EU member states to tackle common challenges together and further strengthen the European Union. The Paris Declaration on Integration and Human Rights; the Berlin Process on Security and Integration; the Malta Declaration on Social Compact and the Digital Future of Europe are all examples of this new phase of integration.\nWe take a closer look at where Europe is heading with its various endeavours towards greater unity.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
