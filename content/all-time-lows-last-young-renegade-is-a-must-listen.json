This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

Today, there are more ways than ever to access and enjoy hip-hop music; from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to video sharing sites like YouTube, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Now, he\\u2019s back with another new album, titled \\u201CVoicenotes.\\u201D It\\u2019s a solid effort that shows growth and maturity, as well as keeping Puth\\u2019s fun and lighthearted style.\nAt its core, Voicenotes is an acoustic pop album. However, it goes deeper than just putting electric guitars aside; these songs are stripped right down to the bare bones. There\\u2019s still plenty of production value\\u2014especially on the third track\\u2014but it feels like Puth made a conscious decision not to hide behind anything.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There are no heroes in this period\\u2014just two paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a stark world where there are no easy answers.\nThe 1980s was a peak moment in that tension\\u2014from Reagan\\u2019s \\u201Cevil empire\\u201D speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe.
