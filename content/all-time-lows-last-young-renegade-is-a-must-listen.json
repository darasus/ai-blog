The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days. From vampires to werewolves to Frankenstein\\u2019s monster and his re-imagined counterpart, Victor Frankenstein, there isn\\u2019t much left that hasn\\u2019t already been done multiple times before. In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.
