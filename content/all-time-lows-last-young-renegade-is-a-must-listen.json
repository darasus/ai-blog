  "summary": "Themes include regret, growing up, and wondering just where your life is heading. The production on ‘Last Young Renegade’ is something else. It has a more mature and atmospheric sound than anything else you will find on All Time Low’s back catalogue. It is also incredibly cinematic, with lots of orchestral backing and sound effects. There are some real stand-out moments in this production, particularly the ending of ‘Walls’ (during which you will believe someone has hit the rewind button on their CD player)",

Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.
