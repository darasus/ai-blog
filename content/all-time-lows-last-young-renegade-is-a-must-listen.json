Films like \\u201CSelma\\u201D are necessary to remind viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents. The town was also home to Selma\\u2019s most famous resident at the time: Collin W. Lewis, also known as \\u201Cthe Lion of Selma\\u201D \\u2013 a prominent civil rights leader who had grown up there after his family fled Greenwood as part of the Great Migration from 1916-1921. In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
