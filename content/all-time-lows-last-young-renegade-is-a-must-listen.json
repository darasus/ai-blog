Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.
