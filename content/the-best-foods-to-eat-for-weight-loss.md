summary: The best foods for weight loss are natural unprocessed foods. Fat,
  protein and carbohydrates are the three main macronutrients found in food. Fat
  and protein are “slow burning” or “thermogenic” nutrients. Carbohydrates have
  been given a bad reputation for making people fat, but the truth is that not
  all carbs are bad. Eating too many fruits can cause weight gain because they
  have approximately as many calories as other sugary foods. Whole grains are
  rich in B vitamins, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc, which are
  essential for good health.
intro: >-
  You want to lose weight. You want to eat healthier, but all those diet
  articles and fad diets seem like a lot of confusing information. Which diet is
  best? What kind of foods should you eat for weight loss? Do carbohydrates make
  you fat? Will cutting carbs help you lose weight faster? There seems to be no
  shortage of information about what not to eat if you want to lose weight fast.
  But what if we told you that almost everything you think you know about food
  is wrong? 

  Crazy, right? Well, it might come as a surprise to learn that the best foods for weight loss are actually unprocessed natural foods—not magical chemicals and supplements. Eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats will help you lose weight faster than any fad diet or crash diet could ever dream of accomplishing. No matter which diet you choose, these are the best foods for weight loss.

## What You Should Know About Calories Before Jumping to Any Conclusions

In order to understand why the best foods for weight loss are natural unprocessed foods, we have to take a quick dive into the world of calories. Calories are the unit of measure for the amount of energy found in food. We need a certain number of calories each day in order to survive and function properly. Where things get confusing is when we discover that different types of foods have different amounts of calories per serving. It is also important to understand that not all calories are created equal. Some calories are used by our bodies whereas other calories are stored as fat.

Fat, protein and carbohydrates are the three main macronutrients found in food. Two of these three macronutrients (fat and protein) are “slow burning” or “thermogenic” nutrients, meaning they are metabolized slowly and help your body burn more calories. On the other hand, carbohydrates are “quick burning” nutrients—they are metabolized very quickly and have the potential to lead to weight gain. Carbohydrates have been given a bad reputation for making people fat, but the truth is that not all carbs are bad. There are two kinds of carbohydrates: simple and complex.

## Natural Foods That Help With Weight Loss

Fruits - Fruits contain fiber and water, which makes them satiating and filling. They also contain vitamin C, which helps boost your metabolism.
Fruit is rich in vitamins, minerals and other antioxidants that can improve your overall health. Other possible benefits of fruits include reduction in the risk of certain cancers, lower blood pressure and prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Fruits are a low-calorie food, but they are also high in sugar (fructose). Eating too many fruits can cause weight gain because they have approximately as many calories as other sugary foods.
If you are trying to lose weight, you should eat a small portion of fruits daily. A small portion is about one piece for each 100 calories of daily intake.

Vegetables - Vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. These nutrients help reduce inflammation and prevent various diseases.
Vegetables are low in calories and rich in water, which makes them very filling. If you are trying to lose weight, you should eat cooked vegetables with a little bit of organic butter.
Vegetables are very healthy for weight loss because they contain no fat and very few calories. You can eat as many vegetables as you want while trying to lose weight.

Whole Grains - Whole grains are rich in B vitamins, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc, which are essential for good health.
Whole grains are rich in fiber and protein and are very filling, which makes them perfect for weight loss.
If you want to lose weight, you should replace your usual starchy carbohydrate-rich foods with whole grains.

## Lean Proteins for Weight Loss

Proteins are essential for the growth and repair of all your body tissues, including muscle. Eating more protein can help you maintain your muscle mass as you age and when you are dieting.
You can get all the protein you need from natural and unprocessed foods such as legumes, beans, dairy, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds and soy products.
Eating more protein can help you lose weight. Protein takes more energy to digest than other nutrients like carbohydrates and fat.
If you are trying to lose weight, you should eat about one serving of protein per day for every 100 pounds you weigh.

## Healthy Fats for Weight Loss

Fats are an essential part of any diet. The right types of fat are very good for your health and can help you lose weight.
Fats are rich in vitamins and minerals, and they are also required for the proper functioning of your hormones.
Fats are also an excellent source of energy.
If you are trying to lose weight, then you should eat the right types of fats. The best fats for weight loss include fish, nuts, seeds and avocados.

## Bottom Line

The best foods for weight loss are unprocessed natural foods. Eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats will help you lose weight faster than any fad diet or crash diet could ever dream of accomplishing. No matter which diet you choose, these are the best foods for weight loss.
