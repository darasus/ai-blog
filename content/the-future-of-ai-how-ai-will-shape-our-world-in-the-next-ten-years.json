While these platforms can be wonderful tools for keeping in touch with friends and family, they also come with risks \\u2014 especially when it comes to your personal data. Facebook users can now read again and again how their data was misused by the company and its partners. There are constant scandals around this subject. Social media users need to be more conscious about what they share and how they share it.\nUnfortunately, most of us don\\u2019t read user agreements or privacy policies until something goes wrong\\u2014and that\\u2019s too bad, because those documents often contain important information about how your personal information is going to be used by that service provider. In many cases, you\\u2019ll see an \\u201COK\\u201D button beside the user agreement, meaning you must agree to continue using the app or site if you want to proceed any further.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
