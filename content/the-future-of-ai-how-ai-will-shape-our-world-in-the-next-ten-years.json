However, as more people use the internet and begin interacting with various programs and applications on websites, things become slightly more complicated.\nAs you probably know if you browse social media sites or read news articles online frequently, there are now several different \\u201Clanguages\\u201D being used on websites to make them more interactive.

The world is on the cusp of an exciting new era in wireless technology, as the rollout of fifth generation (5G) cellular networks begins across the globe.\nEven though 4G LTE coverage is widespread and newer 5G networks aren\\u2019t quite ready for large-scale implementation just yet, carriers around the world are already testing out pre-Release 15 5G network services. Several national operators have already begun deploying their 5G network infrastructure, while others are set to follow suit in the coming months. The race is on to lead the way in this cutting-edge technology and reap the benefits that come with it. It\\u2019s a fast-moving space, so here\\u2019s everything you need to know about 5G and when you can expect it to launch where you live.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
