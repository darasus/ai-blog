When it comes to getting fit, making a resolution is only the first step. You also need to have a plan and be willing to put in the work. Here are some tips to help you make your resolution to get fit a reality:

1. Set realistic goals. Don't try to do too much too soon or you'll quickly get discouraged. Start with small goals that you can realistically achieve.

2. Make a plan. Decide how you're going to reach your goals. What kind of exercise will you do? When and where will you do it? Having a plan makes it more likely that you'll stick with it.

3. Find a workout buddy. A workout buddy can help you stay motivated and accountable. Choose someone who has similar fitness goals and who you enjoy spending time with.

4. Set up a home gym. Having a home gym makes it easy to find time for exercise. You don't have to worry about weather or traffic, and you can work out whenever it's convenient for you.

5. Join a gym or fitness class. If working out at home isn't for you, consider joining a gym or taking a fitness class. This can give you access to more equipment and help you stay motivated.

6. Make it a lifestyle change. Getting fit isn't a short-term goal; it's a lifestyle change. To be successful, you need to make healthy choices most of the time. That means eating healthy foods and getting regular exercise.

7. Be patient. Don't expect to see results overnight. It takes time and effort to get fit, so be patient and stick with it.
