## Why Resolutions Fail

Resolutions fail when they are not realistic. If you set yourself a target that is too ambitious, too far out of your current reach, you are much more likely to give up. And if you can’t think of a resolution that you know you can achieve, then it will be much harder to motivate yourself to stay focused.

To succeed in following through on your resolution, you need to pick a goal that is challenging but also within your reach. You want to set yourself up to succeed, not fail. A resolution should be something that is achievable, but that also requires effort.
There are a few other things that can prevent you from keeping your resolution.

- Not having enough information and support to get started. You need to know the best way of going about reaching your goal.

- Not having the right mindset. You need to feel confident and excited about your resolution.

- Not having enough time to commit to it. You need to have the time to actually follow through with your resolution.

## Make A Plan

Whether you want to lose weight, build muscle or simply eat healthier, there is a way to achieve your goal.
There are many different approaches to fitness. Some are more flexible than others. You may want to try out different methods to see which one works best for you.
To make sure you are on the right track, you will need to make a plan. This includes deciding how much time and effort you are going to commit to your goal, as well as how you are going to go about it. Whether you prefer strength training at the gym, running outside or practising yoga at home, you need to know what to do, when and how often.
You will also want to figure out what steps you need to take to reach your goal. If you want to lose weight, for example, you will need to figure out what your daily calorie intake should be, as well as how many calories you will burn through exercise.

## Find Your Why

You should have a healthy relationship with fitness. It is not about transforming your body into some super-human specimen or becoming a fitness model. It’s about staying healthy and feeling good about yourself, improving your self-confidence and having more energy.
This kind of fitness is achievable for all of us, no matter what shape we are in, what our fitness level is or how old we are.
If you want to keep on following through on your resolution, you need to find a “why”. The “why” is your real motivation. The “why” is the reason why you want to achieve your resolution.
It can be anything, but it needs to be something that resonates with you on an emotional level. It can be anything from wanting to look good in your bikini, to having more energy to spend time with your kids, to finally being able to do that one activity that you’ve always wanted to do.

## Commit To An Activity You Love

There are plenty of reasons why you should commit to a regular fitness routine. Regular exercise can improve your mental health and wellbeing, make you more productive, lower your risk of certain diseases, increase your longevity and improve your relationships with other people.
Healthy habits like eating well, sleeping well and exercising regularly are not just something you should do because you “ought to”. They are essential for everyone.
This doesn’t mean that you have to become a fitness fanatic and spend every moment of your day at the gym. If you are planning to focus on weight training, cycling or running, you will need to increase the amount of time you spend in the gym or out doing your chosen activity.
But if you love to dance, you can follow a dance-based fitness class once or twice a week. If you love swimming, you can go swimming as often as you like. If you love yoga, you can practise it at the studio or at home.

## Don’t Forget About Breakfast And Dinner

You may have heard that you should skip breakfast or dinner if you want to lose weight. This is untrue. You should actually eat breakfast and dinner every day, even if you are trying to lose weight.
Healthy eating includes breakfast, dinner and two healthy snacks in between. This is the best way to get the energy and nutrients your body needs to function properly. Healthy eating is not about starving yourself or eating super-tiny portions.
To make sure you are following a healthy diet and eating the right kinds of food, you can use an app like MyFitnessPal. This app can help you count the calories you are consuming and it will give you a helpful breakdown of where those calories are coming from.

## Track What You Eat

If you want to lose weight and make sure you are eating a healthy diet, you need to keep track of what you eat. This will also help you avoid eating too many processed foods that are bad for your health.
If you are using an app like MyFitnessPal to track your caloric intake, you can also track what you eat. This will give you a more accurate picture of how much you are eating and will help you stay within your daily caloric intake.
You don’t have to rely on online calculators to track the calories in the food you are eating. You can also use an app to scan the barcode of the food you are about to eat and get the nutritional breakdown right away.

## Be Realistic, But Don’t Be Afraid To Push Boundaries

Resolutions are often related to self-improvement and bettering your life. This is a good thing. It means that you want to improve and change for the better.
But it is important to be realistic, even if you want to push your boundaries.
You can’t expect to go from being couch potato to fitness model within the next 12 months. That is not only unhealthy and unproductive, but also completely unrealistic.
You need to set yourself achievable goals. You want to set targets that are challenging but attainable.
It is okay if you don’t reach your goals at the time you expected to. If you failed to meet your expectations, you can always try again or adjust your goals to make them more realistic and attainable. You can always try again next year.

## Bottom line

Your New Year’s resolution is a great opportunity to start afresh and make a positive change in your life. It is a chance to make a promise to yourself to live a healthier and happier life. If you want to succeed, you will need to make a plan, find your motivation and commit to an activity you love. Don’t forget about your daily meals and track what you eat. Finally, be realistic, but don’t be afraid to push your boundaries.
