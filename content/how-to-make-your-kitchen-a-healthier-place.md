summary: The kitchen is the heart of your home, so it makes sense to make it a
  healthier place. One of the best ways to do this is to change the things that
  you buy and the methods that you cook. Instead of buying unhealthy ready
  meals, buy fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, and healthy grains. You can also
  change the way you cook your food, such as cooking your vegetables in healthy
  oils, spices, herbs, and slow-cooking a slow cooker will save you money in the
  long term.
intro: "You probably don’t need anyone to tell you that the modern Western diet
  is not healthy. Whether in a home, restaurant, cafeteria or any other eatery,
  almost all food establishments serve high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat
  meals that are laden with salt and unhealthy oils.What is unfortunate about
  this situation is that many people have no choice but to eat this way on a
  regular basis. If you work in an office, it’s highly likely that your building
  has its own kitchen where a catered lunch service prepares hot lunches for
  staff every day. Similarly, if you go to school, there will most likely be a
  canteen serving the same type of unhealthy food as an adult educational
  institution.The good news is that even if you are stuck eating these foods on
  a daily basis, you can make your kitchen a healthier place by altering what
  goes into the meals you cook at home and the ones that you buy. Here are some
  tips on how you can do just that:"

## Change what you buy

Food shopping is a major part of what you do in the kitchen, so it is important to change the items that you buy. Instead of buying unhealthy ready meals, buy fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, and healthy grains like whole-wheat pasta and brown rice. Fresh produce and grains will be cheaper than frozen and ready meals, and they re-usable, so they will save you money in the long term.
Instead of buying frozen vegetables, buy fresh vegetables. Frozen vegetables are often blanched before being frozen, which can reduce their nutritional content and flavor. Fresh vegetables, on the other hand, retain their fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while also remaining cheaper.
Instead of buying unhealthy oils and animal fats, buy healthy oils like olive oil and vegetable oil. Similarly, instead of buying high-fat cheeses, buy low-fat or reduced-fat versions of your favorite cheeses. While these may be more expensive than their full-fat equivalents, they will be healthier, and you will also be able to reduce the overall calories in your meals.
Instead of buying unhealthy processed snacks, grab some nuts or dried fruit. These snacks are healthier, will keep you full for longer, and will be cheaper than their heavily processed equivalents.

## Change what you cook

As well as the ingredients you buy, you can also change the way you cook your food. Cooking your vegetables in healthy oils, for example, will add flavor and nutrients. Similarly, adding spices and herbs to your meals will help to add flavor without adding fat. You may want to invest in a slow cooker if you are a busy person; not only will this allow you to cook nutritious and tasty meals, but it will also save you money on your energy bills.

## Replace unhealthy fats

Healthy fats are essential to a healthy diet. However, many people, particularly in the Western world, consume too many unhealthy fats. These fats are often found in processed foods, meat products, and, of course, oils. The best way to replace these unhealthy fats is to use olive oil instead of other oils. Extra virgin olive oil is healthy and will not only improve the taste of your food, but it will also help you to improve your diet.
Use basil and garlic in place of butter and other unhealthy fats in vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Not only will this make the vegetables tastier, but it will also reduce the calories in them.

## Replace unhealthy carbs

Many people in the Western world consume far more carbohydrates than they need. This can lead to many health problems later in life, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. You can replace unhealthy carbs with healthy ones by eating more protein-rich foods, such as fish and meat, and fiber-rich foods, such as vegetables. Additionally, you can replace unhealthy carbs with whole grains. Not only will whole grains be healthier and more nutritious than the processed variety, but they are also cheaper.

## Replace unhealthy proteins

It is true that we need to eat more proteins than we do carbohydrates. However, many people eat far too many proteins, which can lead to health problems, such as heart disease, kidney damage, and liver damage. The best way to replace unhealthy proteins is to eat more fish and meat that is low in fat.

## Conclusion

Your kitchen is the heart of your home, so it makes sense to make it a healthier place. One of the best ways to do this is to change the things that you buy and the things that you cook. Whether you change the ingredients or the method that you cook, it will make your kitchen a healthier place.
