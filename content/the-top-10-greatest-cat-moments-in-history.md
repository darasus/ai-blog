summary: During the 16th century, when tobacco was imported and traded as a
  commodity, cats were a common sight in warehouses and trading ships. Cats have
  adopted humans as their primary source of food for millennia, but dependence
  on humans for survival has made them more than just evolutionary partners. In
  Japan, for example, it’s customary to express gratitude toward guests by
  serving them fish as a delicacy. The Japanese believe that the more tails a
  tabby has, the more fortunate and prosperous the household is.

  So you think your cat is cute, and that’s a wonderful thing. After all,
  cats are fluffy and adorable creatures who also happen to be natural stress
  relievers. But do you think your cat is cute enough to make it into the
  history books? Probably not. Sorry to burst your bubble, but even the cutest
  cat in the world would struggle to compete with some of these feline friends
  when it comes to making an impact on human history... 

  Cats have been a constant companion of humans for thousands of years. They’re enigmatic creatures with a reputation for being aloof and independent; they don’t ask for much and they keep very little as repayment. But cats demand something intangible from their owners: companionship. As a result, there are many famous cats in history whose exploits have become the stuff of legend…

## Sick-n’-twisted feline antics

If you’re a cat owner, you’ve probably witnessed your furry friend exhibiting some sick-and-twisted feline antics (SAT). Cats are naturally curious and mischievous creatures, and they’re often drawn to the things that humans consider dangerous. During the 16th century, when tobacco was imported and traded as a commodity, cats were a common sight in warehouses and trading ships. Somehow, they discovered a burning curiosity for tobacco, and – like a true cat – would get high by chewing on the leaves.
But tobacco was at the time a luxury item that had been drawn into the world of commerce and trade, so it was kept out of reach of human fingers. Cats, however, have been known to chew on almost anything. This led to tobacco being harvested and prepared in a way that made it more accessible to paws.

## Tubby Tabby enjoys a snack

Cats have adopted humans as their primary source of food for millennia, but this dependence on humans for survival has made them more than just evolutionary partners – it has made them a part of human culture. In Japan, for example, it’s customary to express gratitude toward guests by serving them fish as a delicacy. In Japanese culture, the fish is a symbol of prosperity and growth, so it is a gift that is expected whenever someone pays a visit – even if they’re just dropping by to do some business.
But the Japanese have a tradition of serving guests with a side dish of 9-tailed, 1-eyed, 2-legged, 3-souls, 4-winged, 5-coloured, 6-legged, 7-coloured, 8-winged, 9-coloured tabby cat. This is because the Japanese believe that the more tails a tabby has, the more fortunate and prosperous the household is.

## Persian kitty plays with a human

The only thing more intriguing than the history of cats is their future. It’s fascinating to observe how a species that is supposed to be solitary and independent is somehow able to come together en masse and create a subculture that enables them to live among humans. Cats have been present in the United States since its earliest days, and many have become the stuff of urban legends throughout the years, especially in the context of the American dream – a dream that has become synonymous with the idea that anyone can make it.
Some cats have even been able to rise above the rest and achieve celebrity status. One of the most famous examples of this is the cat who appeared in the famous painting “American Gothic”. The painting’s subject is a man and a woman who are posed in front of a house in such a way that they appear to be holding a pitchfork and a broom, respectively, as though they are rural American farmers.

## The Sphinx’s favorite snack

The Sphinx is arguably the most famous and memorable of all the statues in Egypt. It’s a massive and imposing structure, one that has stood in the desert for thousands of years and has become an enduring image that is synonymous with the region. But did you know that the Sphinx isn’t a statue of a human king or ruler? It’s a statue of a lion.
The Sphinx is the name of both the statue and the neighbouring Giza plateau that it stands on. But the Sphinx isn’t just a lion’s head carved out of stone – it’s also a grim reminder of one of the darker moments in feline history.
While the Sphinx has inspired countless works of art, poetry, and other creative endeavours, it is also said to be a monument to the world’s first recorded serial killer.

## Dark Ages cat keeps the peace

The years between the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Renaissance are often referred to as the Dark Ages because they were so lacking of creativity and innovation. This period of time was largely defined by the spread of disease, famine, and wars that caused widespread death and destruction. But some cats were able to rise above this darkness and use their powers for good.
During the Middle Ages, cats were often found on trading ships. They kept the ship free of vermin and other pests, so they were generally welcomed with open arms. When ships from England began travelling to the New World, they brought cats with them to keep the ships free from pests. The cats made their way to the New World and began to spread across the continent.

## fluffy feline sparked a revolution

Cats have been inspiring people to stand up for themselves and make a difference in the world for millennia. But it’s only recently that they’ve been able to share their message with a truly global audience.
During the 20th century, particularly during the 1960s, many cats began rising up against their oppressors. The original idea behind the “make love, not war” slogan was that people should stop fighting with each other and start making love instead. But cats across the world took the message to heart, and began making love with each other to make a difference.

## Insta-famous kitty inspires art and fashion trends

The world has become increasingly connected and globalized, thanks in part to the rise of social media and the internet. Cats have taken advantage of these technologies to get their message out to the world, and have inspired everything from fashion to art movements.
Some cats have even been able to turn their Insta-fame into a career as a model. The most famous cat to achieve this is the fluffy feline who inspired the “Look at This Fluffy Kitty” meme. While the meme was little more than a way to express boredom or frustration, it inspired thousands of other people to express their love for cats and bring attention to their importance in society.

## Bottom line

Cats have been evolving as a species for millions of years, and it’s fascinating to observe the changes that have taken place along the way. While some traits have remained constant, other behaviours and characteristics have been entirely shed over time.
Cats are a social species who have been living with humans for thousands of years and have become an essential component of human society. As the human population continues to rise, it’s important to remember that cats are a necessary part of our ecosystem.
