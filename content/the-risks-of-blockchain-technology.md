summary: When you use blockchain, you’ll store data as a series of transactions.
  Each transaction is recorded on a “block” and linked to the one before it and
  the one after it. Because of this structure, anyone can see and access that
  data. Even with permissioned blockchains, you'll lose confidentiality of data
  because all participants can see the data. If you use the public blockchain,
  your business will pay for every transaction that occurs on the network.
  Hybrid blockchains allow you to update the software as needed without
  affecting the data that is stored on the blockchain.
intro: >-
  The rise of blockchain technology has made it possible for digital data
  to be verified, stored, and accessed in a safe and secure way. Companies are
  beginning to use this technology to manage the digital certificates of their
  products and verify their authenticity. Because blockchain is widely known as
  the technology behind Bitcoin, many businesses are hesitant to adopt it
  because of its association with cryptocurrency. However, that reputation isn’t
  necessarily fair. The real risk lies in how companies implement blockchain
  instead of the technology itself. 

  There are potential risks when adopting new technologies such as blockchain; however, implementing it correctly can help your business thrive by streamlining processes and reducing costs. This article explains the risks of blockchain technology and how you can mitigate them before implementation.

## Loss of Confidentiality

One of the biggest risks of blockchain technology is a loss of confidentiality. When you use blockchain, you’ll store data as a series of transactions. Each transaction is recorded on a “block” and linked to the one before it and the one after it. Because of this structure, anyone can see and access that data. That means that even if you use blockchain to store sensitive data, the confidentiality will be compromised.
If you need to store sensitive data in a blockchain, you’ll need to use a private or permissioned blockchain. These types of blockchains are only available to a select number of participants. However, even with permissioned blockchains, you’ll lose confidentiality of data because all participants can see the data.

## Loss of Integrity

Another risk of blockchain technology is a loss of data integrity. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores data on a network of computers. As a result, the data is replicated across multiple locations. This is a huge benefit because if one computer on the network goes down the others can continue to operate without interruption. However, this also means that the data on these computers will not be as accurate as data on a centralized server.
If you’re storing critical data on a blockchain, you’ll need to make sure the others are accurately recording the information. If the computers on the network aren’t recording the data correctly, then they could corrupt the data and affect its integrity.

## Environmental Risk

The risk of environmental risk is a common concern when it comes to blockchain technology. Many industries have strict regulations about storing data in certain areas. While blockchain technology can help improve data storage, it can also be a risk to the environment if not implemented correctly.
When computers store data on a blockchain, they’re using a lot of energy. This is because computers are constantly checking and verifying each transaction on the network. If you’re using blockchain to monitor and store data from multiple sources, those computers will require a significant amount of energy.
Because data is stored on a blockchain network, your business will be responsible for this energy usage. If you choose to use the public blockchain, your business will pay for every transaction that occurs on the network. This includes the transactions of other businesses and users.

## Fraud and Manipulation of Data

Another risk of blockchain technology is fraud and manipulation of data. If a hacker is able to access the chain, they can alter the data. This is a huge risk for businesses that implement blockchain technology. However, if you use blockchain in the right way, you can mitigate this risk.
To prevent fraud and manipulation of data on the blockchain, you’ll need to implement a hybrid blockchain. A hybrid blockchain combines both public and private blockchains to give you the benefits of both. This will allow you to use the public blockchain to create a digital certificate of authenticity and the private blockchain to secure other sensitive data.

## Lack of Standardization

Another risk of blockchain technology is a lack of standardization. If you use the public blockchain, you’ll be able to share your data with anyone. This is a great feature that can help businesses expand and scale. However, it also means that anyone can see and access your data. If you need to keep your data private, then a public blockchain isn’t the best option for you.
If you need to keep your data private, then you’ll need to use a private blockchain. Private blockchains are only available to a select number of participants. This means that only those people can see the data that’s being stored on the blockchain.
However, different blockchains don’t have the same standards. This means that you’ll need to thoroughly research the blockchain you want to use and make sure it has the highest level of security. You’ll also need to verify that it can meet your unique needs.

## Blockchain is Still in its infancy

Another risk of blockchain technology is that it’s still in its infancy. Blockchain has only been widely used since around 2010. Because it’s so new, it’s still evolving as a technology. This means that blockchain will likely develop even further in the future.
This also means that you’ll need to make sure your blockchain is always updated with the latest features and advancements. Otherwise, your blockchain technology could become obsolete.
This is another reason why it’s important to implement a hybrid blockchain. Hybrid blockchains allow you to update the software as needed without affecting the data that is stored on the blockchain.

## Conclusion

The risks of blockchain technology are real. However, they can be managed if you implement the technology correctly. To mitigate these risks, you’ll need to choose the right type of blockchain and implement it properly. You’ll also need to find ways to work around the limitations of blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology is the future, and it can benefit any industry. If you’re thinking of adopting blockchain, it’s important to understand the benefits and risks associated with it. By managing these risks, you’ll be able to reap the benefits of blockchain technology.
