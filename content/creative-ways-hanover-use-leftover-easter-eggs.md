## Creative Ways to Use Leftover Easter Eggs

Eggs have been a symbol of new beginnings for thousands of years. What better way to start a new tradition than by using up leftover Easter eggs? Here are a few ways to put them to good use:

- Make a pretty table runner - You can use the eggs in lots of different ways, depending on the colours you want to use in your design. Use a glue gun to attach them to a piece of fabric, or use fabric glue to attach them to cork.
- Use them to make a statement on your wall - If you’re looking for something more permanent than a table runner, use the eggs to decorate a wall. Poke a hole in the bottom of the shell, thread some string through, and hang them from the ceiling.
- Create a unique piece of jewellery - If you have a creative friend, ask them to help create something different out of your leftover eggs. The options are endless, and it’s a great way to have something really special to remember the Easter holiday.

## Make Egg Shaped Scrapbooking Embellishments

If the children in your life are too old to hunt for Easter eggs, but you still want to bring some joy into their lives, make some scrapbooking embellishments out of your leftover Easter eggs. You can find lots of ideas online, or you can create your own unique designs. You could try using the shells, or you could use the inside of the shells to make a design out of paint or paper. Whatever design you go with, you can use your creations to decorate paper, boxes, or cards. You could even try creating a collage on your wall.

## Make Natural Dye With Egg Yolks

If you have so many Easter eggs that you don’t know what to do with them all, you could try to make natural dye with the yolks. Break open the eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, and place them in a pot with a few tablespoons of water. Bring it to a boil, and then let it simmer for up to an hour. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool. Once it is cool enough to handle, strain it and store it in a jar. You can use this special dye to colour fabric or paper, or you could use it to make a pretty Easter egg decoration.

## Decorate Eggs With Chalk

If you don’t want to get too messy, you could just decorate the eggs with chalk. You can either draw or write on the outside of the egg with chalk to create a pretty design, or you could write a special message on the inside. You could also use bold colours on the outside to create a decorative piece that can sit on your mantel or shelf. You could use coloured eggs for this, or you could mix the colours up to create a unique pattern.

## Turn Eggs Into a Bright Spring Centerpiece

If you want to use up a lot of your leftover Easter eggs, you can make a large decorative centerpiece. Choose a wide bowl that can hold a lot of eggs, and then fill it with as many as you can fit. You could place it on a table in your living room, and it will bring a burst of bright colour to the space. Alternatively, you could place it on a windowsill or table by the window. This way, it will catch the light, and it will look like it is glowing. You can either leave the eggs as they are, or you could decorate them with a bit of glitter to make them look even more amazing.

## Turn Eggs Into a Cosmic Shaped Playdough

If you have children or grandchildren in the house, you can turn your leftover Easter eggs into colourful playdough. You can find lots of different recipes online, or you could create your own special formula. Once you have the mixture ready, you can use your leftover eggs to make colourful patterns and shapes in the playdough. If you want to, you could use a knife to cut the eggs in half to make them last longer. This will also allow you to make different-shaped designs.

## Use Them to Grow Sprouts You Can Eat

If you want to do something a little different, you could turn your leftover Easter eggs into edible sprouts. You will need to place them in a jar filled with water, and then leave them in a warm place where they will get lots of sunlight. It will take a few weeks for them to sprout, and once they are ready, you can eat them in sandwiches or salads. You will be able to use the leaves from the sprouts, and you can compost the roots after you have eaten them.
