Artificial intelligence is still in its early developmental stages, but the Go programming language is already being used by some developers to create AI applications.

Go was designed with simplicity in mind, and its syntax is clean and easy to read. This makes it a good choice for developing AI applications, as developers can more easily understand and debug their code.

Go also has good support for concurrency, which is important for developing efficient AI algorithms. Concurrency allows multiple processes to run at the same time, which can speed up the development process.

The Go programming language is a good choice for developing artificial intelligence applications due to its simplicity and concurrency support.
