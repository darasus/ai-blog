But while its user experience is second to none, Amazon is not perfect. In fact, the company has a rather sinister side that few customers are aware of.\ne-Commerce giant Amazon recently opened its 10th fulfillment center in New Hampshire. The company now employs more than 7,000 people in New Hampshire and has invested over $300 million in the state. With over 566 million active users worldwide, it\\u2019s safe to say that Amazon is a well-known and trusted brand.\nHowever, if you look a little deeper into how Amazon operates as a business, you\\u2019ll discover some pretty sinister things about them \\u2013 many of which you won\\u2019t read about in their press releases or see on their \\u201CAbout Us\\u201D pages. Here are some of the darker sides of this well-loved brand:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It was by far the most frequently discussed topic on the earnings call \\u2014 even more so than China and tariffs.\nNearly everything Apple discussed on that call revolved around iPhone: When asked about concerns over weakness in Greater China, Apple execs responded by talking about how they were bullish on iPhone sales there long term. When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.
