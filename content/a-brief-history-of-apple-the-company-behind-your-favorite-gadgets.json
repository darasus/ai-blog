  "content": "## Company History\n\nApple Inc. was founded in Cupertino, California, U.S. in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The company’s first product was the Apple II computer, which was released in 1977 and was the first mass-produced computer that featured a built-in keyboard, sound and a Wozniak-designed floppy disk drive. After a number of failed attempts to adapt Apple II’s design and software for use in business settings, Jobs was fired from the company in 1985. He was then re-hired in 1996 and helped start a revolution in business and consumer technology with the introduction of the first iPod, which subsequently led to the development of the iPhone and the iPad. In 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO and was succeeded by Tim Cook, who has led Apple since then.\n\n## The Evolution of Apple’s Logo\n\nApple’s original logo, used from 1976 to 1998, depicted Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. The logo was designed by Ron Wayne, who had only agreed to work with Wozniak and Jobs on the premise that he would retain the rights to the design.\nThe logo was replaced with the “i” logo in 1998, which was created by a design team led by Jonathan Ive. The new logo was intended to represent the company’s transition into the internet era, as well as the “intelligent” and “imaginative” qualities of its products.\n\nThe “i” logo has remained Apple’s branding to date. It has undergone various changes (e.g. the addition of a “G” in 2011 after the company’s name was changed from Apple Computer Inc. to Apple Inc.), but remains the same in concept and design. The logo is widely known for its minimalist design, as well as for the way its different elements come together to form a single “apple”.\n\n## Key Figures\n\n- Steve Jobs - co-founder of Apple Inc., CEO, chairman and majority shareholder of the company from 1976 to 2011.\n- Steve Wozniak - co-founder of Apple Inc., chief engineer and majority shareholder of the company from 1976 to 1985.\n- Tim Cook - CEO of Apple Inc., executive vice president of the company since March 1998.\n- Ronald Wayne - co-founder and first chairman of the company.\n\n## What Products Does Apple Currently Manufacture?\n\nApple currently manufactures a wide range of products, including smartphones, laptops and desktop computers, smart home appliances, virtual reality headsets and a variety of software applications.\n\niPhones are Apple’s flagship products and have been the company’s main source of income since their launch in 2007. They are manufactured in multiple locations across the globe, including Ireland, the U.S., Brazil, China, Japan, India and Taiwan.\nThe latest model in the iPhone series is the iPhone XS, which was released in September 2018. The XS features a 5.8-inch OLED display, a hexa-core A13 Bionic chip, an improved dual-lens camera and Face ID facial recognition.\n\n## Apple Watch\n\nThe Apple Watch is a smartwatch manufactured and marketed by Apple since 2015. The device’s core functionality revolves around health and fitness tracking, as well as communication and entertainment through a connected smartphone.\nThe Apple Watch was the first product to be released under the company’s Apple Watch branding, which was introduced in 2014. It was then succeeded by the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018, with the latter model featuring an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and fall detection software.\n\n## iPhone\n\nThe iPhone is a line of smartphones manufactured and marketed by Apple Inc.

The first-generation iPads were released in April 2010, and the latest model in the series is the iPad Air released in October 2018.\n\nAlthough the iPad is primarily used for consuming content, it can also be used for light productivity tasks. The iPad is often compared to the Microsoft Surface Go and the Samsung Galaxy Book due to its relatively low price point, limited functionality and general lack of built-in keyboard functionality.\n\n## macOS (Formerly OS X) and macOS Sierra\n\nOS X, formerly known as Mac OS X, is a desktop operating system designed and developed by Apple Inc. Since its initial release in 2001, OS X has been the primary operating system for Apple’s Macintosh computer line. The latest version of OS X is named macOS Sierra, and it was released in 2016.\nThe system is currently available in three different editions, each of which corresponds to a specific type of computer: macOS High Sierra is designed for Mac desktops and laptops; macOS Mojave is designed for Mac desktops and laptops; and macOS Sierra is designed for Mac desktops and laptops.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApple is one of the most prominent technology companies in the world, and its products are used by millions of people every day.
