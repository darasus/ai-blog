In addition to eating plants for most of your calories, a plant-based diet eliminates or reduces your consumption of animal products like meat, eggs, dairy and honey.\nThe reasons for going plant-based are as varied as the people who do it. Some people feel that this diet is the best way to reduce their carbon footprint and live in harmony with nature. Others see it as a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet (SAD).\nMany simply like the taste of plants more than meat.
