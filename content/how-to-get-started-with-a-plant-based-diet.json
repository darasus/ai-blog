  "title": "How To Get Started With A Plant-based Diet",
  "summary": "Many people who eat a 100% plant-based diet consume an unbalanced amount of carbohydrates and fibre while not getting enough protein and vitamins from plants. It’s very easy to fall into the trap of eating mostly refined carbohydrates like bread and pasta, which aren’t the best sources of nutrients. You can begin by eliminating animal products from your diet one at a time, or by cutting out all animal products at once. If you want to take it slow, start by replacing one product a week with a vegan alternative.",

Famous celebrities, athletes and even foodies are swearing off meat and animal products to lead a more plant-based life.\nThis practice is also known as \\u201Cveganism\\u201D or an \\u201Cethical vegan\\u201D diet. In addition to eating plants for most of your calories, a plant-based diet eliminates or reduces your consumption of animal products like meat, eggs, dairy and honey.\nThe reasons for going plant-based are as varied as the people who do it. Some people feel that this diet is the best way to reduce their carbon footprint and live in harmony with nature. Others see it as a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet (SAD).\nMany simply like the taste of plants more than meat. Whatever your reason for trying a plant- A great first step is learning how to start with these tips!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
