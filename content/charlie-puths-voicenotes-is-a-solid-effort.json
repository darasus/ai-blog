Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama.

This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

But there are still some great pop albums that aren\\u2019t filled with auto-tune and EDM drops.On May 25th, the Scottish band Chvrches released their third album called \\u201C Love is Dead.\\u201D The synth-pop band has lots of happy vibes and catchy hooks on their new album. It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After two decades in the music business, Death Cab for Cutie have developed into one of the most beloved bands in indie rock.\nAfter their last album, Codes and Keys (2012), frontman Ben Gibbard announced that he was working on a solo project called The New Age. It was something he had been thinking about for some time but wasn\\u2019t sure when or if it would come to fruition. Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place. The album came out as a collaborative release between Ben Gibbard and Nathan Wiley under the name The Further Adventures of New Age.
