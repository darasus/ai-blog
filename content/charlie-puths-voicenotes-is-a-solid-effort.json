  "summary": "The lead single off of the album, “Short Hair,” is a very catchy and fun pop track. The title track, Voicenotes, is “inspired by what [he] went through” and that “the emotions and the feelings” were his inspiration. Puth also teamed up with frequent collaborator Shawn Mendes for a song called “Change My Life” It’s a great collaboration that shows that Puth and Mendes are both on their way to becoming superstars.",

Though he\\u2019s stayed in a similar genre, and some of the songs have a similar feel, he\\u2019s experimented with new sounds and new styles, while still keeping his sound. There are still strong pop hooks throughout all of these songs, but he\\u2019s exploring different textures and different feels. He\\u2019s growing as an artist, and it\\u2019s a really nice progression to see.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Puth also seems to be growing as a songwriter. These songs are less endearing and more mature than those on his previous two albums. The lyrics of Voicenotes are a bit darker, and they\\u2019re more real. You can feel the emotion behind each song, and it feels like Puth has really put himself out there.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Voice Notes: Title track and lead single\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Voicenotes is the first track on the album, and it is a beautiful and breathy acoustic pop song. Puth\\u2019s voice is particularly strong here, and the chorus is an absolute banger. The lyrics are contemplative and are reminiscent of an adult journal or a letter to someone close to the writer. Puth has said that the song is intended to be a love song, and that it was written while he was in a relationship. It\\u2019s a very personal song, and it\\u2019s a great way to kick off the album.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The lead single off of the album, \\u201CShort Hair,\\u201D is a very catchy and fun pop track. It\\u2019s a bit more upbeat than many of the songs on the album, and it\\u2019s a great choice for a lead single.

It is a laid-back, chilled-out pop track with a dreamy soundscape. It has a very laid-back rhythm and texture, and Puth\\u2019s breathy vocals fit perfectly with the song. The chorus is dreamy and gorgeous, and it is one of my favorite tracks off of the album.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The title and chorus make a play on the \\u201C8-track\\u201D sound system that was popular in the 70s and 80s, while Puth\\u2019s voice and tone are perfect for this laid-back and dreamy track. It\\u2019s a very chilled-out song, and it\\u2019s a great track to relax to.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Change My Life (ft. Shawn Mendes)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"\\u201CChange My Life\\u201D is the 14th track on the album. It is a very catchy, upbeat track, with a light and airy tone. Despite the fact that it has a light tone, the track is very deep and meaningful, with Puth and Mendes singing about finding someone who can save them. It\\u2019s a very sweet, meaningful track, and it\\u2019s another one of my favorites on the album.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The track is a very strong collaboration, and it\\u2019s a great track that shows two artists who are both on their way to becoming superstars.

Hailee Steinfeld)\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"\\u201CMood Music\\u201D is the 25th track on the album. It is a very dark and moody track with a very unique soundscape, and it is a very interesting track. It\\u2019s a bit more experimental, and it\\u2019s a very different sound from most of the rest of the album. It\\u2019s a very different track, and it\\u2019s one that I personally love.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It\\u2019s another track that feels very real, and it\\u2019s a very interesting track that\\u2019s worth listening to even if you don\\u2019t usually go for this type of music.

It\\u2019s not quite a perfect album, but it\\u2019s a great effort. Puth has shown growth as a songwriter, has shown creativity, and has proven that he is more than a one-hit wonder. Voicenotes is an acoustic pop album that is going to be a great addition to any playlist.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
