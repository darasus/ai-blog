At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory.\nThis is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it\\u2019s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse \\u2014 instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.\nA few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete \\u2018A Brief History of Time\\u2019 which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold. In 2014, the film \\u2018The Theory of Everything\\u2019 was released based on the book by Jane Hawking about her marriage with Stephen which further cemented his fame as one of the most brilliant minds in history today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It's also a film about performance, but it's not a concert movie. It is, however, an electrifying and exhilarating portrait of the world of jazz drumming: its practice; its professors; its players; its perfectionists. It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
