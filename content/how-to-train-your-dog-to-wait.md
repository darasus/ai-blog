summary: The first step in getting your dog to wait is to get him to stop
  following you when you leave the room. It’s important that you don’t
  physically keep your dog in one place by holding his collar, wrapping a leash
  around his chest, or using any kind of physical restraint. This can create an
  association in the dog's mind that you doing this means he should stay put.
  You can use shaping techniques to help your dog learn to wait for longer
  periods of time.

  You probably have a number of reasons why you wouldn’t want your dog to
  follow you from room to room. You might have company coming over, and not
  everyone likes dogs in their space. You might be trying to watch TV or read a
  book. Or perhaps you simply need some time to yourself. In any case, you’d
  like the dog to stay put for a few minutes when you leave the room rather than
  follow after you and knock over your favorite lamp or end table on the way.

  As we all know, puppies don’t come with instruction manuals. Even though they’re smart animals, they also have their own ways of doing things that can leave us scratching our heads at times. They are not always willing to do what we want them to do with ease and grace.

## The Basics of Teaching a Dog to Wait

The first step in teaching your dog to wait is to get him to understand the word “Wait”. This could be a word you use exclusively for this purpose, or it could be one of the many “C” and “K” words that dogs already understand and we use all the time. Whichever word you choose, you should be consistent about using it for this purpose only.

While you’re working on this training, it’s important that you don’t physically keep your dog in one place by holding his collar, wrapping a leash around his chest, or using any kind of physical restraint. This can create an association in the dog’s mind that you doing this means he should stay put. But if you want to keep him in one place while you’re not there, you’ll need to use a different method that doesn’t give him negative associations with your presence.

## Establishing a “Wait” Command

The first step in getting your dog to wait is to get him to stop following you when you leave the room. The way to do this is to say the word “Wait”, and then leave the room.
Once he’s by himself in the room, he will probably start wondering what he’s supposed to do now. It’s at this point that he might start scratching at the door or jumping at it in an attempt to follow you. If he does, praise him and tell him “Wait” again, but don’t let him out of the room.
Wait until he’s stopped scratching or pawing at the door, and then go back into the room and praise him again.

## Reinforcing Behaviors You Like

Once you’ve gotten your dog to understand the word “Wait” and you’ve begun to train him to stay in the room, you can start rewarding him for staying put. Rewarding him can take a number of different forms, but it’s important that you only reward him while he’s waiting, not while he’s scratching at the door.
Wait until he’s relaxed and stopped pawing at the door, and then praise him and give him a small treat.
This can be a great way to reinforce the “Wait” command, and it can help him associate the command with something positive.

## Shaping Behaviors You Want

As you progress with your training, you can use shaping techniques to help your dog learn to wait for longer periods of time. This process will help him associate waiting with the door or barrier you want him to stay behind and not with you or your actions.
Wait until he’s relaxed and stopped pawing or scratching at the door, and then stand next to the barrier with the treat in your hand and wait again.
When he turns away from the door, even if he’s still waiting and looking in that direction, praise him and give him the treat.
Wait until he turns away from the barrier again, and then repeat.
Once he’s good at this, you can start introducing other distractions that are happening in the room with him.

## How to Build on What You’ve Taught So Far

Once you’ve gotten your dog to understand that he should stay in the room and not follow you when you leave, you can start adding new behaviors to the process while keeping the other ones consistent.
Once he’s waiting by the door or barrier, you can walk away from him and give him the “Wait” command.
When he turns away from the door and starts to follow you, tell him “Wait” again with a slight pause between the two words.
Wait until he turns away from the door again and then praise him and let him follow you.
Continue this process until he’s good at following you while remaining in the room.

## Wrapping Up

As you continue working with your dog, you can start to add more distractions to the process, such as having people in the room or having other dogs with him. You can also start experimenting with new environments and see how your dog does waiting in other places.

The important thing to remember is that you must be consistent with your training and you must reward your dog for doing what you want him to do. If you don’t, you’ll find that you’ll get nowhere with your training, and your dog may even stop following the “Wait” command you’ve already taught him.
