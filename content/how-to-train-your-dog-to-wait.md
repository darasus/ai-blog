One of the first things you need to do when you get a new dog is to train them to wait. This is an important skill for your dog to learn as it will help them to be more patient and less likely to beg for food or jump up on people.

Here are a few tips on how to train your dog to wait:

1. Start with basic obedience commands such as sit, stay and down. Once your dog has mastered these commands, you can begin to work on teaching them to wait.

2. When you give your dog a command, make sure that you are using a clear and concise voice. This will help your dog to understand what you are asking of them.

3. Be consistent with your commands. If you tell your dog to wait and then immediately let them have what they want, they will not understand what you are asking of them.

4. Be patient when training your dog. They will not learn overnight and it may take some time and patience on your part.

5. Use positive reinforcement when your dog does what you ask of them. This can be in the form of treats, praise or both.

With some time and patience, you can train your dog to wait for what they want. This is a valuable skill that will help them to be more well-behaved and less likely to beg or jump up on people.
