There are plenty of ways to get fit without a gym membership. Here are five:

1. Take up running – it’s free, all you need is a good pair of shoes, and you can do it anywhere, anytime.

2. Get involved in a local sports team – many towns and cities have recreational leagues for all sorts of sports, from basketball to softball to ultimate Frisbee.

3. Go hiking – there are often great hiking trails located near urban areas, and getting out into nature can be a great way to de-stress as well as get some exercise.

4. Use at-home workout DVDs or online programs – there are now many options available for working out at home, often for a fraction of the cost of a gym membership.

5. Take advantage of free trial periods at local gyms – most gyms will offer a free week or two so that you can try out their facilities and see if you like it before committing to a membership.
