Mediation is a process where two parties in conflict attempt to reach a resolution through the help of a neutral, third-party mediator. The mediatorâ€™s role is to facilitate communication and help the parties find a mutually agreeable solution. Mediation is often used in divorce cases, but can be used in any type of dispute where the parties are willing to try to resolve their differences through mediation.

The success rate of mediation depends on a number of factors, including the willingness of the parties to compromise, the skill of the mediator, and the nature of the dispute. In general, mediation has a high success rate, with studies showing that over 70% of cases are resolved through mediation. However, there is no guarantee that mediation will be successful in every case, and some disputes may be better suited for other methods of resolution, such as arbitration or litigation.
