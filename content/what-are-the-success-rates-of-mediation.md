summary: Mediation is best used when parties want to resolve their dispute as
  quickly and inexpensively as possible. Mediation involves the participation of
  a neutral third party called a mediator. Mediator is a person who is trained
  in communication and impartiality and facilitates a discussion between two
  parties in dispute. Mediators are expected to be neutral and use active

  Mediation is a dispute resolution process that involves the participation
  of a neutral third party called a mediator. The parties to the dispute agree
  to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case.
  Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has
  to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both. 

  Mediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there’s no clear right or wrong side or when it’s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.

## What Are The Requirements For Mediation?

There are a few requirements that must be met for mediation to be successful. First, all parties must be willing to participate in the mediation process. There must be cooperation from all sides in order to be successful. This means all parties must be willing to disclose information, listen to the other side, and explore possible options for compromise.

In addition, parties must have a common goal for their dispute. A grievance may be pursued for different reasons, such as a desire for compensation or the wish for an apology. While mediation can sometimes resolve both of these types of disputes, the parties must agree on a common goal for the mediation process to be successful.

Mediation is best used when parties want to resolve their dispute as quickly and inexpensively as possible. The parties must be willing to make concessions in order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

## The Role Of A Mediator

A mediator is a person who is trained in communication and impartiality and facilitates a discussion between two parties in dispute. The mediator has no legal authority: they are there to help the parties identify common ground and arrive at a mutually agreeable solution.

A mediator is expected to be neutral and use active listening skills to help the parties clarify their needs, understand each other’s view, and reach a mutually satisfying solution. Most mediators have either legal or social work training, or both. They may be a professional mediator, such as a retired judge or someone with a long mediation career track record, or an amateur mediator who is trained on the job and has no prior experience.

## Mediation Process

There are many different types of mediation processes. Some mediation sessions happen informally and may last for just a few hours. Other mediation sessions are more formal and may last for several days.

During mediation, the mediator remains neutral and does not make decisions for the parties. Instead, the mediator encourages the parties to identify their issues, explore possible solutions, and negotiate an agreement that is mutually beneficial. The mediator may also help the parties clarify facts, explore options, and reach a settlement.

Mediators may use several different approaches to help the parties reach agreement. These may include brainstorming, structured negotiation, and other problem-solving strategies. 
Based on the parties’ needs, the mediator may use one approach in the beginning of mediation, and then switch to a different approach later.

## Pros Of Mediation

- Reduced stress and anxiety among participants. When parties are able to resolve their disputes themselves, they feel less stress, anxiety, and uncertainty than they may feel if they are in a courtroom.
- Parties have control over their outcomes. In a courtroom, a judge or jury may make decisions that parties do not like. In mediation, the parties themselves decide the outcomes of the dispute, so there is no uncertainty about the judge’s decision.
- Increased communication. During mediation, parties may communicate more openly and honestly than they might during courtroom proceedings. This communication can help the parties reach a mutually agreeable solution.
- Parties have time to reflect and make well-informed decisions. Since mediation is often less time-consuming than courtroom proceedings, parties have time to think about their dispute and make well-informed decisions. 
- Negotiation skills are honed. Participating in mediation often helps parties hone their negotiation skills and learn how to reach mutually beneficial solutions.

## Cons Of Mediation

- Parties must be willing to negotiate and make concessions. In mediation, both parties must be willing to negotiate with the other, make concessions, and possibly give up something they really want in exchange for something they may not want as much. If one party is unwilling to negotiate, mediation is unlikely to be successful.
- Parties must have similar goals and a willingness to compromise. In order for mediation to work, both parties must have similar goals for their dispute and be willing to compromise. If one party is only pursuing a particular outcome and is not willing to compromise, mediation likely will not be successful.
- Parties must be willing to disclose facts. In some types of disputes, parties may not want to disclose facts to the other side. For mediation to be successful, both parties must be willing to disclose information, especially facts that may help the other party understand their perspective more fully.
- The mediator must be unbiased. In mediation, the mediator must remain unbiased. If one party does not think that the mediator is being unbiased, the mediation process will likely be unsuccessful.

## Conclusion

Mediation is a dispute resolution process that involves the participation of a neutral third party called a mediator. The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.

Mediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there’s no clear right or wrong side or when it’s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.
