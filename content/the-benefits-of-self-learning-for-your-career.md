## You Can Shun Irrelevant Repetitions with Self-Learning

Repetition is how you learn to do something. If you try to learn a skill but are unable to do so, you may feel frustrated or guilty. You may feel that you are a “failure” simply because you are unable to do something. Self-learning is different from traditional learning as it does not require you to “pass” a skill or a test to show that you’ve learned something. Instead, it allows you to learn at your own pace and in your own way. You may feel frustrated if you are required to commit information to memory that has no relevance to your life. As such, self-learning allows you to select what you want to learn, how you want to learn it, and when you want to learn it. This means that you’re free to learn what you want, when you want, and how you want.
