Break-ups are never easy, and they can be even more difficult and hurtful if it\\u2019s with your first love or someone you really cared about. These tips will help get you through any heartbreak and back into a place of peace.\nWhen you experience a break-up, whether it\\u2019s from a partner, friend or family member, it leaves you with an empty feeling. It hurts so much because you placed so many emotions into the relationship that it now feels like a part of who you are has been taken from you. Even though the person who broke up with you may have been oblivious to the pain they were causing by ending things, that doesn\\u2019t make breaking up any easier for anyone involved.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Keeping all of your emotions inside is going to make you feel even more isolated, depressed and it might even lead to you feeling suicidal. If you don\\u2019t have anyone to talk to, there are some great online forums where you can go to get some advice and support from others who have been in your situation. You can also talk to a professional with a service like Talkspace and they can help you get to a place of peace.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Don\\u2019t be afraid to ask for help.

Not only will this help you to get your feelings, thoughts and emotions out, but it will also give you a record of how you were feeling at the time of the break-up.
