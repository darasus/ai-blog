It\\u2019t also less expensive than going to court and doesn\\u2019t give your opponent any negative information that could be used against you in the future. The only potential drawback to mediation is that it requires both parties to agree on an outcome they are happy with. If one party feels like they have no other options, they may not be willing to mediate. However, this should not stop you from exploring this option further.\nMediation has many benefits over other methods of dispute resolution, such as negotiation and arbitration. However, every type of settlement has its drawbacks. Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of mediation as a dispute resolution technique:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

People from different backgrounds, beliefs, and values come together, break apart their differences and find common ground. Mediation is an effective way to resolve conflicts and disputes without going to court or getting into an adversarial situation where the parties are at loggerheads with each other forever.\nInstead of arguing back and forth, each side presents their case in a neutral environment. The mediator facilitates conversations by guiding participants through a series of questions and processes that lead to resolution. What we call mediation isn\\u2019t one single process but many variations of it. They can be broadly categorized into three types \\u2013 Collaborative mediation, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) mediation or neutral third-party intervention; Family or couple mediation; And Tribal mediation.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
