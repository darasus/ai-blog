intro: >-
  In the 1980s, Stephen Hawking was at the peak of his scientific career.
  At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having
  published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory. 

  This is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it’s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse — instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.

  A few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete ‘A Brief History of Time’ which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold. In 2014, the film ‘The Theory of Everything’ was released based on the book by Jane Hawking about her marriage with Stephen which further cemented his fame as one of the most brilliant minds in history today.

## Movie Review: “The Theory of Everything”

The Theory of Everything is a biographical drama film directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten. It is based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Hawking, the first wife of Stephen Hawking, and chronicles the marriage between Hawking and Jane. It stars Eddie Redmayne as Hawking, Felicity Jones as Jane, and Emily Watson as Hawking’s first wife, Margaret. The film had its world premiere at the London Film Festival on October 19, 2014, and was theatrically released in the U.K. on October 31 and the U.S. on November 7, 2014.

The film received critical acclaim and received Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA, and Critics' Choice Awards nominations. It was also made into a short documentary called The Making of the Theory of Everything which discusses the film’s production.

## What is the movie about?

This is a biopic of Stephen Hawking, a renowned theoretical physicist. It chronicles his relationship with his first wife, Jane, and the onset of his motor neuron disease (ALS). The film begins in the early 1980s when Hawking was at the peak of his career. At this time he meets and marries Jane and they have three children together. The film details the struggles and hardships Hawking and his family encounter as he is diagnosed with ALS and eventually becomes almost entirely paralyzed. This is when Hawking begins to see ALS as something other than a curse, as it becomes a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.

The film also follows Jane’s experiences as a caregiver for her husband, and her efforts to have his condition recognized as a legitimate medical condition. Hawking himself makes a cameo appearance at the end of the film when he meets with the real-life Hawking for the first time.

## Pros

The film is visually pleasing and brings the audience back to a time when people had to write or type out all their thoughts. It is interesting to see the comparison between how people used to communicate versus how they communicate today.

The film also gives an inside look into the life of a person with a physical disability. We get to see what everyday life is like for people with disabilities, including the various adaptations and accommodations they use in their daily life.

The film also highlights the importance of having a supportive partner and family in one's life. It is important to have people surrounding you who support you and are willing to stand by you during both the good and bad times.

## Cons

The film is set in a different time when people communicated and shared their thoughts on paper and in books. While it may have been interesting for some people to see the differences between how people communicated in the past and now, others may have found this aspect of the film to be boring and unnecessary.

The film does not talk about Hawking’s scientific discoveries or his perspectives on the universe and physics. While this may have been interesting to some people, it may have been disappointing to others who wanted to know more about Hawking’s work and his findings on the universe.

The film is dramatized, and it does not talk about Hawking’s scientific discoveries or his perspectives on the universe and physics. It instead focuses on how Hawking’s life was and on his family.

## Bottom line

The Theory of Everything is a touching biopic of Stephen Hawking that brings his life to life on the big screen. It highlights a number of important themes, including the importance of having a supportive partner and family in one's life and the importance of adapting to/making accommodations for a physical disability. While the film does not talk about Hawking’s scientific discoveries or his perspectives on the universe and physics, it does bring to light how his life was as a person with a physical disability. The film is beautifully shot, has an excellent soundtrack and stars great actors. It is a must-watch for all cinema lovers, especially those who are fans of history or the sciences.
