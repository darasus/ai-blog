intro: >-
  New Year’s Eve is a fantastic occasion for bringing people together and
  having a communal celebration. However, it’s usually either the most awkward
  party of the year (if you are single) or an excuse to get trashed and make out
  with someone in a magic hat (if you are coupled-up).

  If you’re looking for something more than just that – but also want to avoid playing another Frozen drinking game – here are some great board games that will allow you and your friends to get in the festive spirit. 

  Whether you have a small group or intend on playing with many more guests, there are plenty of games that will be enjoyable even with a large group of players. These board games all make excellent party games and can be played by anyone regardless of age or skill level.

## 7 Wonders

If you like card games, you will love 7 Wonders. It’s a card-based game that requires strategy, careful planning, and several hours to finish a full game, making it excellent for larger groups of players. It’s been around for a while, so you can find it almost anywhere and in many different formats, including online. The game is divided into seven rounds, where each player is dealt seven cards, and each round represents one of the great wonders of the world being built. You are given eight different resources, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and each round has you deciding how to use them. Your opponents might be given the same cards as you, but you don’t know what they will do with them until the cards are played. That makes 7 Wonders both strategic and unpredictable. It’s perfect for a large group of party guests since each game lasts about an hour and it can accommodate as many as 7 players.

## Betting Games

There are a number of card games that can be adapted for a betting format. It’s easy to change the rules of any standard game and add a betting element. It’s a great way to get people engaged with the game and also have something riding on the match. 

One of the most popular betting games is Bingo. You can play it on any scale you like but using a standard Bingo card with a certain number of words on it, you can make it easier for the people who aren’t as good at remembering obscure facts. 

Another game that works well with betting is Poker. It’s a good game to learn to play if you want to play more than one game with your friends. It has a relatively simple ruleset and is easy enough to be played with a group of non-gamers. You can even play with a simplified version of Poker that is played with only two cards.

## Cards Against Humanity

Cards Against Humanity is an excellent choice for a group of friends who want to let their hair down and have a laugh.

Cards Against Humanity is a great game to play with a large group of people. You can easily tailor the game to different numbers of participants.
