summary: Meditation is the act of sitting down with the goal of focusing on one
  thing only – your breath. The goal is to silence the mind and get it off the
  constant thinking so you can relax and bring your stress levels down. There
  are different types of meditation, but they all have the same goal – to bring
  you peace and calmness inside. There’s no right or wrong way of doing it – you
  can sit on the floor, in a chair or even lie down if that’�s more comfortable
  for you.

  another without even noticing. Most of us have a hard time dealing with the

## What is meditation?

Meditation is the act of sitting down with the goal of focusing on one thing only – your breath. The goal is to silence the mind and get it off the constant thinking so you can relax and bring your stress levels down. There are different types of meditation, but they all have the same goal – to bring you peace and calmness inside.

There’s no right or wrong way of doing it – you can sit on the floor, in a chair or even lie down if that’s more comfortable for you. The important thing is to focus on your breathing and get your mind to “shut up”.

## How to meditate?

- Find a quiet spot to start off your meditation session. You can do this at home, in a park or even at your office if you have a quiet spot there.
- Sit comfortably on a chair or the floor, or even lie down if that’s more comfortable for you.
- Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Get your mind to “shut up” so it doesn’t start thinking about other things.
- If you’re finding it hard to focus, use the sound of the waves or a ticking clock as a guide to help you.
- Stay in meditation for at least 15 minutes – starting off slowly will help you get used to the practice.

## 7 benefits of meditation

- It makes you more compassionate – When you meditate on a regular basis, you become more compassionate towards other people.

## Key step: Turning up the volume on your senses

When you’re in a meditative state, it’s important to not only focus on your breathing but also on your senses. Start off by turning up the volume on your senses – what can you hear around you right now? What can you smell? What are the textures you feel when you touch something? If you were to see yourself as a camera, what would you focus on? While meditating, you have to make sure that you don’t start thinking about your to-do list, work, or any other stressful thoughts. Instead, you have to focus on the present and be fully in the moment. This will help you take the edge off anything that’s been weighing you down and help you truly relax.

## 4 more steps: Finding the spot where you’re most comfortable

If you’re starting to meditate for the first time, it’s important to find a place where you feel comfortable and relaxed. If you’re sitting on the floor, make sure that you’re not in a position that’s uncomfortable. If you’re sitting in a chair, try to find one that’s not too hard. If you’re lying down, make sure you’re not in a position that’s going to make you uncomfortable. Meditation is an exercise in being present, so you want to make sure you feel as relaxed as possible. Once you’re comfortable, take a few deep breaths and let go of any thoughts or feelings that are weighing you down.

## 3 more steps: Letting go of any discomfort or pain

As we’ve said above, you want to find a place where you’re comfortable and relaxed. That said, if you’ve got pain from an injury, you might have to move to a more comfortable position. Sometimes, sitting in one position will cause you discomfort or even pain – and that’s okay as long as you don’t let it distract you from your meditation session. Once you’ve found a place where you feel comfortable and relaxed, let go of any pain you might be feeling. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and let the pain go. Let it go from your mind and your body. The goal of meditation is to completely remove yourself from your daily life and all the stress and anxiety that comes with it.

## 2 last steps: Finding your mantra and concluding

A mantra is a word or a phrase that helps you focus on what you want from meditation. When you’re beginning to meditate, it’s better to choose a simple word such as “calm” or “relax”. As you go further into your meditation, you can move onto more complex words. As you reach the end of your meditation, take a few more deep breaths. Slowly open your eyes and get ready to face the rest of your day.
