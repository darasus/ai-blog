It can be difficult to feel like you are always the one who is working while your partner seems to be able to relax. You may feel like you are the only one who is responsible for the relationship and that can be a lot of pressure. If you are feeling this way, it is important to communicate with your partner.

It is possible that your partner is not actually aware of how much work you are doing. They may think that you are able to handle everything because you have always been the one who is responsible. If this is the case, sit down with your partner and explain how you are feeling. Let them know that you need some help with the workload.

It is also possible that your partner is aware of how much work you are doing but they are not sure how to help. In this case, it is important to be specific about what you need help with. Do you need help with the housework? Do you need them to watch the kids so you can have some time to yourself? Once you are specific about what you need, it will be easier for your partner to help.

If your partner is always working, it can be difficult to find time for each other. You may feel like you are always the one who is doing the work and that can be frustrating. If this is the case, try to schedule some time each week where you can focus on your relationship. This can be a time where you go on a date or just spend some time talking to each other. It is important to make sure that you are still making time for each other even if your partner is always working.
