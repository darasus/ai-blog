summary: Co-working is a way of working that brings together people from
  different companies and industries in a shared space to exchange ideas and
  collaborate. Here are some tips for dealing with someone who is always
  working. Remember that your partner’s job can be stressful, and it's important
  for them to decompress when they come home. Set boundaries and don’t be a
  martyr, even if your partner is working a lot, you still have to do your fair
  share around the house and with the kids.
intro: >-
  Working too much is a problem many people struggle with — but it’s even
  more challenging when you’re in a relationship with someone who has the same
  work ethic. If your partner usually leaves for work before you even get out of
  bed, or isn’t home until after you’re already in bed, things can get tricky.

  Working from home, flexible hours and remote working are all buzzwords in today’s labor market. Companies are becoming increasingly aware that it isn’t just about how much time employees spend at the desk but also about what they achieve during that time. A Gallup poll found that telecommuting or working from home is growing in popularity among professionals across most industries. Working remotely makes it easier to find jobs, negotiate schedules and live without a commute.

## What Is Co-Working?

Co-working is a way of working that brings together people from different companies and industries in a shared space to exchange ideas and collaborate. Typically, co-working spaces offer amenities such as conference rooms, break rooms, internet and phone access. Many also provide additional services such as training and networking events, administrative assistance and even catering.

Co-working is the perfect arrangement if your partner works remotely and you’re at home with a little one. Co-working spaces offer you a chance to socialize and make connections with other people in your industry. You can also use the time to network online or get your work done without the distraction of your home.

## How to deal with a partner who’s always working

Are there times when your partner works too much? If so, it could create a strain on your relationship. Here are some tips for dealing with someone who is always working. Remember that your partner’s job can be stressful, and it’s important for them to decompress when they come home. You don’t want to make them feel guilty or resentful if you’re always prying.

Try not to take it personally - Your partner’s workload might not have anything to do with you. They might be stressed, worried or have other factors that are causing them to work more than they normally would. Remember, trying to change someone’s behaviour is a difficult task. It’s important that you don’t take their extended hours at the office personally.

Ask them if they’re feeling stressed - If you notice that your partner is working more and longer than they normally would, ask them if they’re feeling stressed. You don’t want to pry, but it’s important to let them know that you’re there for them.

Don’t be a martyr - Remember, you’re in a relationship with this person and you both have responsibilities. Even if your partner is working more hours than usual, you still have to do your fair share around the house and with the kids. Don’t be a martyr, and don’t feel guilty for asking for help. It’s important that you don’t get resentful and start resenting your partner just because they’re working more.

## Set boundaries and don’t be a martyr

Even if you’re in a relationship with someone who works a lot, you still need to set boundaries. If your partner is always working, it might be a good idea to set certain times of the day or certain days when they have to stop. If they’re always working and you’re always cleaning the house and taking care of the kids, resentment could set in.

It may be helpful to create a to-do list together and set a time limit on certain tasks. You may end up with a long list of chores, but at least you know what you need to do and what your partner should be helping with.

Also, don’t be a martyr. Even if your partner is working a lot of hours, you still have to do your fair share around the house, including taking care of the kids. You don’t want to resent your partner just because they’re working longer hours than usual.

## Don’t burn your dinner

This may sound silly, but it’s important that you don’t burn your dinner because you’ve been rushing around trying to get everything done. You don’t want to end up sick and tired because you’ve been rushing around.

Try to pace yourself and take some time to relax. If you have kids, try to give them a bath, play with them or read them a story before you start rushing around the house.

Take breaks while you’re working, even if you’re not feeling stressed or overtired. You can take a break by going for a walk, taking a bubble bath or even meditating.

## Take care of yourself physically and mentally

If both of you are always working and never relaxing, it’s easy for both of you to become burnt out. Make sure you are taking care of yourself physically, like getting enough sleep and eating well.

You should also be taking care of yourself mentally, which means not bottling up your feelings and letting them fester. If you and your partner are both working too much, it could cause resentment and anger. Make sure to share your feelings with your partner and open up about how you’re feeling. Communicate with each other and don’t let things build up.

Taking care of yourself physically and mentally will help you avoid getting stressed out and will also allow you to be a better partner. You’ll be less prone to snapping at your partner if you’re not stressed out.

## Conclusion

Working too much is a problem that many people struggle with. It’s even more challenging when you’re in a relationship with someone who has the same work ethic. If your partner usually leaves for work before you even get out of bed, or isn’t home until after you’re already in bed, things can get tricky.

Working from home, flexible hours and remote working are all buzzwords in today’s labor market. Companies are becoming increasingly aware that it isn’t just about how much time employees spend at the desk but also about what they achieve during that time. A Gallup poll found that telecommuting or working from home is growing in popularity among professionals across most industries.
