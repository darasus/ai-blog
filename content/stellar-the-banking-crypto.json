Different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Neo \\u2013 which use their blockchains primarily as a payment ledger - the NEM blockchain uses an advanced system of smart contracts CoIN tokens, and atomic swaps to manage almost any kind of commercial property. The scope of its potential applications extends far beyond financial transactions. The non-blockchain application of NEM goes much further than just providing another medium for buying and selling things online. Its developers have also created a \\u201Csmart asset\\u201D system that can be used on almost any business, organization, house, car, boat \\u2013 anything you can think of!

Some people invest in specific cryptocurrencies because they see a particular use case for that token; others invest in specific coins as a hedge against another token; and some invest based on the technical details and potential future use case for that token. There are many individuals who invest in specific tokens primarily because of their privacy features. Privacy is becoming a very important factor to consider when choosing which cryptocurrency to buy into, especially now that so many nefarious forces are targeting the cryptocurrency community with phishing attacks and hacks.

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future.
