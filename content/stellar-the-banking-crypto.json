  "summary": "Stellar is a blockchain protocol that facilitates cross-border payments. The network is decentralized, meaning it is not owned or managed by any single authority. The protocol is designed to facilitate low-cost and quick transfers between two parties. Stellar can process about 1,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest decentralized exchanges in existence. It also supports the creation of “asset-backed” tokens that represent real-world assets like gold coins, company stock, or real estate. In 2015, Stellar was used to facilitate a $100 million payout from WalMart.",
