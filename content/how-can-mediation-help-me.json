In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings.
