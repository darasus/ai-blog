If left unattended, this dirt and oil will cause your dog to smell and leave them more susceptible to infections. Grooming your dog regularly can also help you identify any problems they might have with their skin or fur early on. To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every one to three months.\nThe benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence.
