  "summary": "When parties settle a dispute through mediation, they have to come to an agreement on their own. Mediation is less effective if the parties do not reach an agreement during the session. The parties can use any method they want to come up with a solution that works best for everyone involved. When both parties are willing to work toward a solution together, mediation is much more effective. The two parties have the option of signing a document that confirms the terms of the mediation session. There is no guarantee that either party will be satisfied with the outcome of mediation. Going to court always has its drawbacks, but it is important to understand that mediation is important over court.",

This means that the mediation process can take a long time, especially if the parties have different expectations for the outcome. It can also be difficult to mediate a dispute if the parties have very busy schedules. For example, if one party has to travel often for their job, it may be difficult to find time to finish the mediation process in a timely manner. However, mediation can also reduce the time it takes to settle a dispute. When parties collaborate with each other to find a solution, they often find it easier to come to an agreement on terms that work for everyone.

If the two parties are very far apart on their terms, they may not be able to come to a solution during the mediation session.

If one party feels like the mediator is trying to impose their own terms, the situation can quickly become unproductive. This can happen for a few reasons.
