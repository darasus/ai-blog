When both parties are willing to work toward a solution together, mediation is much more effective.

For example, if one party has to travel often for their job, it may be difficult to find time to finish the mediation process in a timely manner. However, mediation can also reduce the time it takes to settle a dispute.

If you take the time to understand what motivates them and reward them for good behavior, they will respond by trying harder next time.\nIf you're willing to put in the time and effort, almost any dog can be trained to sit on command. It's just a matter of identifying your dog\\u2019s motivation and rewarding him for the behaviors that you like. With consistent training sessions every day or two, your dog will learn how to sit in no time at all.\nTraining your dog doesn\\u2019t have to be difficult or stressful \\u2013 it just requires commitment and patience from both of you. The more straightforward training techniques like marker words, positive reinforcement and treat rewards should get your dog responding obediently within a few weeks.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019t not the same thing as arbitration or negotiation. Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral third party, the mediator, assists others in exploring issues, managing conflict, and solving problems in an effort to resolve conflict and move forward. The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequence. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It\\u2019t win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their dispute.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer these services pro bono publico, which means \\u201Cfor the good of the public\\u201D without charge.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
