Not getting enough sleep can also increase your risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and obesity. The National Institute of Health reports that adults should get about 7-9 hours of sleep each night for optimum health.\nGetting a good night\\u2019s sleep isn\\u2019t always easy.
