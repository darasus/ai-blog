Itâ€™s a programming paradigm that allows you to access data stored in a relational database using the constructs of object-oriented programming (OOP) like classes, objects, inheritance, etc. Using this API, you can write code as if you are working with a local in-memory data structure but your code is actually accessing the database.",

In today\\u2019s world, there is an increased penetration of mobile devices and other end user devices that need always-on services. So, it becomes essential for enterprises to implement systems that can handle frequent outages and are always available.\nThis blog is the first article in our Hibernate series where we will be covering all the concepts related to Hibernate. Here, we will begin by understanding What Is Hibernate? How Does It Differ From Other APIs? And learn about the different versions of Hibernate. We will also go through an introduction to the Architecture of Hibernate and its core components such as sessionFactory, Session, etc.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
