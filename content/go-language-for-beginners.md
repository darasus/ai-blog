Go is a programming language created at Google. It is a statically typed, compiled language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.

The language was announced in November 2009, and version 1.0 was released in March 2012. Version 1.13 was released in August 2019. Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects.

A tour of Go (also known as A Tour of Go) is a set of interactive exercises meant to introduce the Go programming language to beginners. The tour is divided into a series of sections, each with its own focus.

We'll start with an overview of the language: what are its basic features? Then we'll look at the Go tools, which will help you get started writing code. After that, we'll explore some of the more advanced features of the language, like concurrency and reflection. Finally, we'll wrap up with a look at the Go community and where you can go to learn more.
