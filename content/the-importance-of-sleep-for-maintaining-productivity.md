summary: When we don’t get enough sleep, our brains start to make automated
  decisions. This can lead to people saying and doing things they normally
  wouldn't do. Being tired can also lead to you getting sick more often. You
  also might not have as much energy to exercise and take care of your body.
  Getting enough sleep is crucial if you want to stay productive and healthy.
  There are many treatments that can help people who are dealing with mood
  disorders like depression and anxiety. Fortunately, these conditions need to
  be diagnosed first so people can start getting the help they need.
intro: >-
  Did you know that sleep is just as important as eating and drinking
  water? Without it, we can’t function properly. Studies show that people who
  get less than six hours of sleep every night have a harder time focusing, are
  less alert, and are more prone to making mistakes. Did you know that there are
  even studies that show getting less than five hours of sleep for two weeks
  straight can lead to hallucinations and other warning signs of declining
  mental health? 

  That might be a little bit scary for some people, but the truth is: You need to make sure you’re getting enough rest if you want to remain productive throughout your workday. Unfortunately many people underestimate the importance of sleeping well, but this also means they’re not aware of all the ways that lack of sleep can impact them both physically and mentally.

## The Health Risks of Lack of Sleep

For many people, the immediate effects of not sleeping enough are probably more obvious than the long-term effects. Stress levels can rise, which can cause a lot of health problems if you let it get out of control. If you get stressed out all the time, you could encounter issues with your immune system, blood pressure, and more. You could also start to experience anxiety and depression, which can also lead to many health problems if you don’t try to get it under control.

There are also a lot of long-term problems that people can encounter if they don’t sleep enough. You can end up becoming depressed, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and actions if you’re not careful. You can also start to experience mood disorders if it gets really bad, and you may have a really hard time recovering from this.

## Depression and Mood Disorders

People who are depressed may feel sad nearly all the time, have a hard time enjoying activities that they used to enjoy, lose interest in things that they once cared about, have trouble sleeping, and more. Mood disorders are similar to depression in many ways, but they affect different people in different ways. There are many different mood disorders, and each one has its own set of symptoms.

People who suffer from mood disorders might feel very anxious or stressed out, or they might have very low moods for no reason at all. Mood disorders like depression and anxiety are very common, and many people have them without even realizing it at first. Fortunately, there are many treatments that can help people who are dealing with these conditions, but they need to be diagnosed first so that people can start getting the help they need.

## Automated Behaviour and Bad Decisions

When we don’t get enough sleep, our brains start to make automated decisions. We don’t really think about our actions and choices, we just do them on autopilot. When we’re tired, we don’t have the energy to think critically about our actions, so we don’t really think about what we’re doing.

This can lead to people saying and doing things they normally wouldn’t do. For example, if someone is tired and they need to drive, they might become more impatient than they normally are. They might be in a hurry to get to their destination and be less patient with other drivers than they usually would be. If they’re behind the wheel while they’re tired, they might be more likely to make bad decisions that could lead to an accident.

## Muscles and Physical Health

Being tired can also lead to you getting sick more often. When your body is tired, it doesn’t fight infection as well as it normally would. When you don’t get enough sleep and your body isn’t functioning at its best, you’re more likely to get sick. You also might not have as much energy to exercise and take care of your body. This can lead to you gaining weight, which can also lead to other health problems. If you have a physical job, you could injure yourself more often if you’re tired, which could lead to you missing work.

## Conclusion

When you get enough sleep, you’re more likely to stay healthy and avoid a lot of issues that lack of sleep can cause. You’ll have more energy, be less likely to get sick, and you’ll be able to exercise and take care of yourself better. You’ll also be able to think more clearly, so you’re less likely to make bad decisions and hurt yourself. Getting enough sleep is crucial if you want to stay productive and healthy.
