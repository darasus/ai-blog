The Great British Bake Off is back with a brand new batch of amateur bakers ready to tackle tricky challenges. Instead of the usual judges, this time we have Prue, Noel and Sandi testing their skills in the kitchen.\nFor those who aren\\u2019t familiar with the show, The Great British Bake Off is a contest where amateur bakers are tested on their baking skills. Contestants are asked to make pastry-based dishes that often feature unusual or difficult techniques, and are judged on appearance, taste and originality. In each episode they face two different challenges: a Signature Bake where they must create something using a specific ingredient or theme as inspiration; and a Technical Challenge which might see them making croquembouche or another difficult dish.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
