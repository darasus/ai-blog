The difference between good carbs and bad carbs lies in their chemical composition. Good carbs are usually processed and refined, stripped of their natural nutrients. Bad carbs are often associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as bad breath and dental problems.

High intake of carbohydrates can lead to an excess production of glycogen in the liver, which is converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue, particularly around the belly.
