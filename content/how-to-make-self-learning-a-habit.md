Self-learning is a habit that can be developed with a little effort and consistency. It is a process of acquiring new skills or knowledge without the aid of a teacher or instructor. It requires one to be proactive and take initiative in seeking out new information. It also necessitates a willingness to experiment and fail, as well as the ability to reflect on one's successes and failures. Here are some tips on how to make self-learning a habit:

1. Set aside time for self-learning every day. Just as you would set aside time for work, exercise, or leisure activities, schedule some time each day for self-learning. This doesn't have to be a large chunk of time; even 30 minutes to an hour can be beneficial.

2. Use that time wisely. During your scheduled self-learning time, make sure to focus on learning something new. This could mean reading about a topic you're interested in, working on a new skill, or taking an online course.

3. Be patient. Learning takes time, so don't expect to become an expert overnight. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the time to learn at your own pace.

4. Be persistent. If you find yourself struggling with a particular concept or task, don't give up. Stick with it and keep trying until you master it.

5. Take breaks. Learning can be taxing on your brain, so make sure to take breaks throughout your self-learning session. Get up and walk around, grab a snack, or take a few deep breaths to rejuvenate yourself.

6. Reward yourself. After you've successfully completed a self-learning session, give yourself a pat on the back (literally or figuratively). This will help reinforce the positive behavior and make it more likely that you'll stick with it in the future.

Making self-learning a habit takes effort and commitment, but it's definitely possible with some planning and discipline. By following the tips above, you'll be well on your way to becoming a lifelong learner.
