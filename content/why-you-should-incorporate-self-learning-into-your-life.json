Unfortunately, there aren\\u2019t many obvious ways to do this \\u2013 especially if you already have a busy life.\nSelf-learning is actually a perfect way to accomplish this important skill upgrade.

In many cases, this allows you to be more flexible with your studies, as you can adjust your syllabus as needed based on other commitments you have. It also helps you avoid wasting time on courses or topics that don\\u2019t interest you.\nThat said, self-learning is an excellent option if you\\u2019re short on time, or if you want to pursue a topic that is rarely, if ever, taught in a formal setting. For example, let\\u2019s say you want to learn about artificial intelligence and its potential impact on the world. You could try to find a course or class that focuses on this, but it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Alternatively, you could simply read books, watch lectures, and articles related to AI to get a better understanding of the subject.\nSelf-learning is also a good option if you want to explore topics that would otherwise be out of your reach.
