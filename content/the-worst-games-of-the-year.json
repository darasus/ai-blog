The story is forgettable, the combat is clunky, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. In addition, the game comes with serious technical issues, which is surprising given its long development cycle. The new dialogue system, which allows players to choose between multiple options to advance the plot, is particularly bad. There are loads of bugs, and the system is prone to creating strange situations where you can\\u2019t proceed further with the game. For example, at one point, I couldn\\u2019t progress because someone thought I was in love with them, but I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to tell them otherwise.

Most of the modes are extremely barebones, which is disappointing given the game\\u2019s premium price. What\\u2019s more, SFV is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that have yet to be addressed. The game\\u2019s netcode is also poor; so much so that it\\u2019s impossible to take the online mode seriously.

It\\u2019s especially annoying given that the game itself costs a lot of money. Even if you don\\u2019t engage in the game\\u2019s pay-to-win economy, you\\u2019ll still be at a disadvantage compared to those who do. There\\u2019s also the poorly-implemented online racing, which has been marked by numerous disconnects and server issues. What\\u2019s more, the developers have been unhelpful in fixing the issues.

These issues are especially evident in the game\\u2019s multiplayer mode, where players sometimes get stuck in the environment or suffer from sound and visual desynchronization. Other reports suggest that the game\\u2019s server is underpowered, which may explain why it\\u2019s struggling to keep up with all the online traffic. Bethesda has said that it will work on fixing the issues, but we\\u2019re yet to see any noticeable improvement.

It\\u2019s the same old FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) with a few small changes that don\\u2019t address the core problem with the system: it\\u2019s just too easy to spend real money on virtual items. EA\\u2019s promise to change the system hasn\\u2019t materialized either; the current iteration is just as bad as its predecessors.

The game\\u2019s visuals and performance are far from stellar as well. All in all, this is a disappointing game from a series that\\u2019s known for high quality and challenging gameplay.

It has also seen the fall of several franchises, such as Assassin\\u2019s Creed, and the rise of new IPs.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"What has also become apparent from this list of the worst games of 2018 is that there is no shortage of bad games. With so many coming out every year, there are some that simply fail to meet even the most basic standards of quality. Some are buggy, poorly made, and poorly designed. Others try too many gimmicks that don\\u2019t work out as intended. In short, it pays to be a vigilant gamer and do your research before buying a game.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
