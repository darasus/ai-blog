The story is forgettable, the combat is clunky, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. In addition, the game comes with serious technical issues, which is surprising given its long development cycle. The new dialogue system, which allows players to choose between multiple options to advance the plot, is particularly bad. There are loads of bugs, and the system is prone to creating strange situations where you can\\u2019t proceed further with the game. For example, at one point, I couldn\\u2019t progress because someone thought I was in love with them, but I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to tell them otherwise.

Most of the modes are extremely barebones, which is disappointing given the game\\u2019s premium price. What\\u2019s more, SFV is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that have yet to be addressed. The game\\u2019s netcode is also poor; so much so that it\\u2019s impossible to take the online mode seriously.

These issues are especially evident in the game\\u2019s multiplayer mode, where players sometimes get stuck in the environment or suffer from sound and visual desynchronization. Other reports suggest that the game\\u2019s server is underpowered, which may explain why it\\u2019s struggling to keep up with all the online traffic.

EA\\u2019s promise to change the system hasn\\u2019t materialized either; the current iteration is just as bad as its predecessors.

With so many coming out every year, there are some that simply fail to meet even the most basic standards of quality. Some are buggy, poorly made, and poorly designed. Others try too many gimmicks that don\\u2019t work out as intended. In short, it pays to be a vigilant gamer and do your research before buying a game.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
