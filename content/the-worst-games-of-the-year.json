The story is forgettable, the combat is clunky, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. In addition, the game comes with serious technical issues, which is surprising given its long development cycle. The new dialogue system, which allows players to choose between multiple options to advance the plot, is particularly bad. There are loads of bugs, and the system is prone to creating strange situations where you can\\u2019t proceed further with the game. For example, at one point, I couldn\\u2019t progress because someone thought I was in love with them, but I couldn\\u2019t figure out how to tell them otherwise. The game is also very buggy and crash-prone, and its visuals are below average.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null),mdx(\"h2\",null),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Fighting Games\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition \\u2013 The latest installment in Capcom\\u2019s legendary fighting game series. Sadly, it\\u2019s just more of the same with a few superficial changes and no real improvement over its predecessor. Most of the modes are extremely barebones, which is disappointing given the game\\u2019s premium price. What\\u2019s more, SFV is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that have yet to be addressed. The game\\u2019s netcode is also poor; so much so that it\\u2019s impossible to take the online mode seriously. Capcom promises that it will address the issues in the coming months, but it\\u2019s hard to take them seriously when they let things get this out of control in the first place.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Racing Games\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Forza Horizon 4 \\u2013 Rare\\u2019s latest open-world racing game is fun to play, but it\\u2019s marred by microtransactions. The game\\u2019s progression system is unfairly stacked in favor of players who are willing to spend money on car parts and mods. It\\u2019s especially annoying given that the game itself costs a lot of money. Even if you don\\u2019t engage in the game\\u2019s pay-to-win economy, you\\u2019ll still be at a disadvantage compared to those who do. There\\u2019s also the poorly-implemented online racing, which has been marked by numerous disconnects and server issues. What\\u2019s more, the developers have been unhelpful in fixing the issues. It\\u2019s a shame, too, because the game is otherwise a lot of fun to play.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Role-playing Games\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Fallout 76 \\u2013 It\\u2019s unfortunate that Bethesda\\u2019s latest open-world RPG is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches, including visual errors and quest-breaking bugs. These issues are especially evident in the game\\u2019s multiplayer mode, where players sometimes get stuck in the environment or suffer from sound and visual desynchronization. Other reports suggest that the game\\u2019s server is underpowered, which may explain why it\\u2019s struggling to keep up with all the online traffic. Bethesda has said that it will work on fixing the issues, but we\\u2019re yet to see any noticeable improvement. Fallout 76 is also marred by an uninteresting story and an underwhelming setting, which makes it feel like a step back for the series.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Sports Games\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"FIFA 19 \\u2013 EA\\u2019s annual football game is fun to play, but it has become stale and uninteresting over the years. What\\u2019s more, FIFA 19 is plagued by microtransactions. It\\u2019s the same old FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) with a few small changes that don\\u2019t address the core problem with the system: it\\u2019s just too easy to spend real money on virtual items. EA\\u2019s promise to change the system hasn\\u2019t materialized either; the current iteration is just as bad as its predecessors. There have also been reports of visual bugs and glitches, which is surprising considering how long EA had been in development on FIFA 19.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Strategy Games\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Total War: Three Kingdoms \\u2013 Creative Assembly\\u2019s latest strategy game is a big disappointment, especially after the high bar set by its predecessor. The game\\u2019s campaign mode is extremely shallow, and it has a poor user interface. What\\u2019s more, the AI is flawed, and the game doesn\\u2019t support multiplayer. The game\\u2019s visuals and performance are far from stellar as well. All in all, this is a disappointing game from a series that\\u2019s known for high quality and challenging gameplay. Hopefully, CA learns from its mistakes and comes up with something better next time.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"2018 has been an interesting year for video games. It has seen the release of several blockbuster titles, such as God of War, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Assassin\\u2019s Creed Odyssey. It has also seen the rise of battle royale games, such as Blackout (Black Ops 4) and Ring of Elysium. It has also seen the fall of several franchises, such as Assassin\\u2019s Creed, and the rise of new IPs.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"What has also become apparent from this list of the worst games of 2018 is that there is no shortage of bad games. With so many coming out every year, there are some that simply fail to meet even the most basic standards of quality. Some are buggy, poorly made, and poorly designed. Others try too many gimmicks that don\\u2019t work out as intended. In short, it pays to be a vigilant gamer and do your research before buying a game.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
