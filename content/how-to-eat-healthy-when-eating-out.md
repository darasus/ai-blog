When you're trying to eat healthy, dining out can be a challenge. But with a little planning, you can enjoy a healthy meal at your favorite restaurant.

Here are some tips to help you make healthy choices when eating out:

1. Look for restaurants that offer healthy options.

Some restaurants are now offering healthier alternatives to their menu items. Look for restaurants that offer salads, lean protein options, and whole grain choices.

2. Ask about the ingredients.

When you're not sure what's in a dish, ask your server. Most restaurants are happy to provide information about the ingredients in their dishes.

3. Avoid fried foods.

Fried foods are often high in calories and unhealthy fats. When possible, choose grilled, baked, or steamed foods instead.

4. Watch your portion sizes.

Restaurant portions are often larger than what you would typically eat at home. When ordering, consider sharing a dish or taking half of your meal to go.

5. Make smart substitutions.

When ordering, make substitutions that will help you cut calories and eat healthier. For example, ask for dressing on the side, hold the cheese, or substitute a side salad for french fries.

6. Drink water.

Water is the best choice when it comes to drinks. But if you're looking for something else, choose unsweetened tea or coffee, or order a small fruit juice or soda. Avoid sugary cocktails and mixed drinks.

By following these tips, you can enjoy eating out while still maintaining a healthy diet.
