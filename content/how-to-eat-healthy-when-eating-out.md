summary: When possible, choose dishes that are packed with fiber and protein.
  Whole grains are a great source of fiber, B vitamins, iron, and other
  nutrients. Check the ingredients list for the items that go into your meal. Be
  wary of French fries, fried veggies and other fried sides. Be careful of
  burgers that come with 80% meat or less, and be careful with your bun and
  condiment choices. Avoid heavy white breads and load up on veggies and lean
  proteins instead of heavy breads.

## Go for protein and fiber

Foods that are high in fiber and protein will help you feel fuller and more satisfied after eating — and help prevent unhealthy snacking later on in the day. So, when possible, choose dishes that are packed with fiber and protein, like these options:

- Soups - Unless your soup is loaded with cheese and croutons, it will typically be very low in calories and fat.
- Salads - Salads are full of fiber and protein. You can also add beans to salads for even more protein.
- Stuffed veggies - Choose dishes that are stuffed with veggies, like bell peppers and mushrooms, over ones that come with heavy sauces or too much cheese.
- Pasta - Choose whole-wheat pasta to up the fiber content.

## Look for whole grains

Whole grains are a great source of fiber, B vitamins, iron, and other nutrients. The difference between whole grains and refined grains, like white flour, is that whole grains retain their bran and germ. This means they have a higher fiber and protein content.

When choosing your grains, consider these options:

- Brown rice - Brown rice has more fiber than white rice.
- Barley - Barley is a great source of fiber, B vitamins, and iron.
- Whole-wheat pasta - Choose whole-wheat pasta over regular pasta for more fiber and nutrients.

## Watch out for sauces

Many sauces are full of fat and calories. They’re also often high in sodium. So, when possible, choose dishes that come with minimal or no sauce. Or, if you can’t do without the sauce, try to choose a healthier option. Some examples:

- Pesto - Pesto is typically made with olive oil, so it’s an unprocessed fat with minimal calories and fat.
- Salsa - Choose salsa over creamy sauces like alfredo or ranch.
- Marinara - Marinara sauce is typically made with tomatoes and onions, so it’s a very healthy option.

## Check the ingredients list

When you can, check the ingredients list for the items that go into your meal. This will help you spot potential allergens and unhealthy ingredients that you might otherwise miss. You can also use this information to make healthier choices. For example:

- If a meal comes with rice, beans, and veggies, you can ask if they can replace the rice with additional veggies.
- If a meal comes with white pasta, you can ask if they can use whole-wheat pasta instead.
- If a meal comes with heavy sauces or cheese, ask if they can leave it out or substitute it for something healthier.

## Order veggies

Many restaurants will let you add as many veggies as you want to your meal. You can ask to add veggies to anything—salads, soups, pastas, stir-frys, sandwiches, and more. And if a restaurant is too fancy for this, you can always DIY by ordering a side of veggies to go with your meal.

In general, though, be careful with your vegetable choices. Some vegetables are higher in calories and fat than others. And many restaurants will fry or fry-fry their veggies in unhealthy oils. Be wary of French fries, fried veggies, and other fried sides.

## Don’t be afraid of the dark side

Burgers, sandwiches, and other classic casual fare can be healthy options when eaten in moderation. Look for burgers that are made with 80% meat or less, and be careful with your bun and condiment choices. When possible, choose burgers that come with lettuce and tomato over buns, and skip the mayo or heavy sauces for a healthier option.

Sandwiches can also be a healthy choice, as long as you choose wisely. Avoid heavy white breads and load up on veggies and lean proteins instead. Wraps can be great options if you’re unsure about the contents of your sandwich.

## Final words

Eating out can be enjoyable and healthy, but it can also be challenging. The best way to overcome these challenges is to be prepared and knowledgeable. By following these tips, you will be able to make better decisions when eating out and keep your diet in check. With some practice and patience, you can eat healthy when eating out.
