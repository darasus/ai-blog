However, as soon as you learn about channels and see how easy it is to implement them, things start making much more sense.

Concurrent programming has many applications in real-world situations because it allows multiple tasks to be carried out at the same time, which can save a large amount of time.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Concurrent programming is particularly useful when a computer requires more time than is available at one time. For example, if a computer has to carry out a process that takes five hours and that computer only has one hour of time available, then concurrent programming can be used to carry out other tasks during the rest of the time.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why do we need concurrent programs?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Computer hardware is only getting more powerful, but programmatic limitations are not keeping up with the times. As the number of programs we\\u2019re using at any given moment increases, the more time we spend waiting for computers to complete tasks. Concurrent programming allows us to execute long-running tasks simultaneously. By taking advantage of multiple cores, we can speed up the completion of tasks that would otherwise take hours to process.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Concurrent programming can also be used to distribute tasks across several servers.
