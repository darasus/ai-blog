As the number of programs we\\u2019re using at any given moment increases, the more time we spend waiting for computers to complete tasks.

The factors listed above make Go an excellent choice for software development projects involving medium-to-large sized codebases, performance optimization, or writing compilers.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don\\u2019t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
