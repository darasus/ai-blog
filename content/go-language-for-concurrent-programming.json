By executing concurrent programs across multiple servers, we can ensure that waiting times are kept to a minimum. Go was designed from the ground up as a concurrent programming language.

You might already know some other languages or have experience with concurrency so you probably are wondering how does the Go programming language help with concurrent programming.\nIf you are just getting started with Go, it might feel like a steep learning curve if you\\u2019ve never used its features before. However, as soon as you learn about channels and see how easy it is to implement them, things start making much more sense. Concurrent programming is an extremely complex topic that requires careful planning to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Fortunately, Go offers a set of standard library packages for concurrent tasks so that developers can focus on writing code instead of reinventing the wheel every time they create a new project. Let\\u2019s take a closer look at why we need concurrent programs and what Go has to offer in this regard.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In other words, a program can be executed on a computer while other programs are also executing on that computer. Concurrent programming has many applications in real-world situations because it allows multiple tasks to be carried out at the same time, which can save a large amount of time.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Concurrent programming is particularly useful when a computer requires more time than is available at one time. For example, if a computer has to carry out a process that takes five hours and that computer only has one hour of time available, then concurrent programming can be used to carry out other tasks during the rest of the time.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why do we need concurrent programs?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Computer hardware is only getting more powerful, but programmatic limitations are not keeping up with the times. As the number of programs we\\u2019re using at any given moment increases, the more time we spend waiting for computers to complete tasks. Concurrent programming allows us to execute long-running tasks simultaneously. By taking advantage of multiple cores, we can speed up the completion of tasks that would otherwise take hours to process.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Concurrent programming can also be used to distribute tasks across several servers. This approach is often used for high volume tasks like search engine crawlers that would otherwise eat up an inordinate amount of bandwidth. By executing concurrent programs across multiple servers, we can ensure that waiting times are kept to a minimum.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go For Concurrent Programming\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Go was designed from the ground up as a concurrent programming language. It has a few key features that make it very easy to create concurrent code. We\\u2019ll focus on two of these features here: channels and goroutines.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Channels are a special type of communication between threads or processes. They let you send and receive data between those threads almost effortlessly. You can even use them for synchronous communication, where both parties are waiting on a response before continuing.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Goroutines are the building blocks of concurrent Go code. You can use them to easily break down tasks into smaller chunks that can be executed in parallel. If you need to wait for a chunk of code to finish, you can use a channel. These features make concurrent programming in Go extremely easy.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go Channels for Synchronous Communication\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Synchronous communication is the type of communication that takes place when both parties expect the conversation to finish at roughly the same time. In this case, the sender will block until the receiver has received and processed the message.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For example, let\\u2019s say that you want to inform a colleague that you have started working on a new project. You walk over to their desk and tell them about it directly. In this scenario, you are blocking until your colleague has finished processing the information, either by acknowledging that they\\u2019ve heard you or asking for more details. While you\\u2019re waiting, you\\u2019re not able to do anything else, which is why we call this synchronous communication.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go Channels for Asynchronous Communication\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Asynchronous communication is the type of communication that is expected to finish at different times. In this case, the sender doesn\\u2019t wait for the receiver to finish processing the message. Instead, they put the message into a channel and the receiver can take their time retrieving it.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Let\\u2019s say that you and your colleague have been tasked with finding a new office space for your department. Your colleague finds a few promising offices that you should check out. Instead of walking over to your colleague\\u2019s desk and holding up their work, you put the information in a channel. They can then retrieve the message when they\\u2019ve got time to research the available offices. This allows you and your colleague to avoid blocking each other.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go Mutex for Coordinated Threads\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While channels are a great way to distribute data and let multiple threads wait for each other, sometimes you need a more structured way to ensure that multiple threads are working together. A mutex is a thread-safe data structure that allows you to control access to a shared resource.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Let\\u2019s say that you\\u2019re building a website that includes a comments section. Comments are submitted by readers and posted to the website, where other readers can see them. You\\u2019re tasked with developing the algorithm that will show comments to readers and let them leave new comments. To do this, you need two different threads: one that shows comments and one that lets readers add new comments. The problem is that both threads will be trying to access the database and other shared resources, so they could potentially get in each other\\u2019s way. That\\u2019s where a mutex comes in handy.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Wrapping Up\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It\\u2019s important to note that concurrency isn\\u2019t a panacea for all programming problems. It\\u2019s most useful for tasks that take a long time, like waiting for a user to respond to a search query or pulling data from a remote database. If a task takes less than a few seconds, it\\u2019s usually better to just do it sequentially and let the user get on with other things.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Programming for concurrency is difficult because you have to account for lots of different factors. These include timing, data dependencies, and resource usage. Go simplifies these issues with special language features and built-in tools that make it easier to write concurrent code.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
