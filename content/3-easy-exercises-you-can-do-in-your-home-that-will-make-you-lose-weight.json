When you strength train, you are increasing your lean muscle mass, which increases your metabolic rate. This means that your body burns more calories, even while you\\u2019re at rest, which is how you actually lose weight! Strength training is also an effective way to reduce joint and back pain and improve your posture, which can help you feel more confident and boost your self-esteem. You don\\u2019t need any fancy equipment or a gym membership to do strength training at home.
