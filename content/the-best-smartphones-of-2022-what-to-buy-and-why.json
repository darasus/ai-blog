These are both new ways for people to find work that better fits their lifestyle and interests.\nWorking from home, also known as telecommuting, has been around for decades but was only adopted by a small group of people because it was not widely accepted or understood.

Are you ready to adapt your career in response to these trends? END`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
