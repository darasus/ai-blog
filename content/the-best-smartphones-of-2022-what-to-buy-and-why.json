  "summary": "The best smartphones of 2022 will feature two screens: one at the front and one on the back. OLED displays will be the preferred display type in favor of its more energy-efficient cousin. Messaging will be more than just a way to communicate with friends and family, they will be a way of communicating with the world. Smartphones will have completely different designs, features and functions than todayâ€™s devices. Dual screen phones have been a sci-fi fantasy for years, but they are finally becoming a reality.",

But by 2022, these devices may seem almost Stone Age in comparison to what comes after them.

Some of the best smartphones of 2018 have massive 6-inch screens or larger, and many of the best smartphones of 2019 and beyond will likely have even larger screens.\nBut the best smartphones of 2022 will buck this trend and offer smaller screens, though they will retain the same large-screen look with perhaps even larger displays thanks to edge-to-edge designs and better screen-to-body ratios.\nThe reasons behind this shift are twofold: First, consumers are indicating they want smaller devices, as evidenced by the success of the iPhone X. Second, smaller screens will be more energy efficient, which will be critical as the world increasingly transitions to renewable energy sources.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Wireless Charging Becomes the Norm\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Smartphones are at their best when they don\\u2019t need to be plugged in. But most devices still require a charger at least once a day, which can be a hassle.\nThis changes in 2022, when wireless charging becomes the standard.\nIn 2022, wireless charging will have moved beyond novelty status, with the best smartphones of 2022 offering built-in wireless charging. It\\u2019s likely that most charging pads will have migrated away from the wall, with charging pads built into tables and couches, and even built into cars and public infrastructure like lampposts.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"OLED Displays Will Be the New Standard\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The best smartphones of 2022 will be packed full of cutting-edge tech, but one of their most basic features will be surprisingly old-school: their displays.\nAir will be the preferred display type in 2022, as OLED has been largely abandoned in favor of its more energy-efficient cousin.\nThis switch will be driven in large part by the adoption of 5G networks, which will require much more energy-efficient devices. OLED screens are also more susceptible to power surges than air-based displays.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"AI Helps Us Find and Organize Our Data\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Smartphones are great for keeping us organized, but there is only so much they can do. They can\\u2019t remind us when to pay bills, track our health or organize our finances.\nAI becomes much more prevalent in 2022, as it is built into everything from our everyday apps to our operating systems.\nWhile most AI will be used to enhance our phones, it will also be used to organize our data. AI will be able to recognize images, and will automatically tag them for easy organization. AI will also be able to understand voice commands and, in the future, written texts.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Messaging Becomes an Operating System\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The best smartphones of 2022 will be more than just a way to communicate with friends and family, they will be a way to communicate with the world.\nThe shift in 2022 is away from apps and toward messaging services, which will be built directly into phone operating systems.\nThis shift is due to a few factors. First, more people are using messaging services like Facebook Messenger rather than downloading individual apps. Second, phone OSes are being designed to support this trend.\nAnd finally, messaging apps are increasingly competing with social networks.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Confirmed: Dual Screen Phones Are Coming\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Dual screen phones have been a sci-fi fantasy for years, but they are finally becoming a reality. The best smartphones of 2022 will feature two screens: one at the front and one on the back.\nThese screens will work together to create an augmented reality that blends virtual images with the real world.\nThese second screens will also likely be built into larger models, as manufacturers like Samsung and Apple have a history of releasing \\u201Cphablets\\u201D with larger screens.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The smartphone is the most important invention of the 21st century, and it is constantly evolving. The best smartphones of 2022 will have completely different designs, features and functions than today\\u2019s devices.\nAnd while these changes will be significant, they\\u2019re also likely to be evolutionary, as smartphone manufacturers don\\u2019t want to make drastic changes that will confuse their users.\nBy 2022, smartphones will be smaller, more energy-efficient and packed with new features that were once only dreamed of.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re shopping for a new phone, it\\u2019s best to wait until 2022 to make your purchase.
