Whatever your reason for investigating coding, Python is an excellent place to start learning about computer programming and creating your own programs.\nCoding is often a seemingly inaccessible skill, reserved for those with a knack for mathematics or sciences. However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding. The key is finding the right resources and a step-by-step learning process that doesn\\u2019t feel like a burdensome chore.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to begin exploring the wonderful world of Python coding, read on to learn more.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so. Let us explore how we can leverage interfaces in our code to make it more modular, reusable, testable and readable.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
