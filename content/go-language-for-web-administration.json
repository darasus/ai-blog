It\\u2019s easy to read and understand and has a much simpler syntax than other programming languages such as C or Java. Its simple syntax, readability, and general ease of use have made Python an extremely popular choice for new programmers. According to the census of programming languages from PYPL, Python is the third most widely used programming language globally with a usage of about 20%. Furthermore, Python was also identified as one of the top 10 fastest growing computer languages. This post will explain why you should learn Python, teach you everything you need to know about this wonderful coding language, and provide some resources for getting started.
