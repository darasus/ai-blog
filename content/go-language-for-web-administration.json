  "summary": "Go is a programming language that was designed by Google engineers in 2007. Go ranks directly behind Java as one of the most popular programming languages used by software engineers. Go is mainly used to build backend services like APIs and microservices, which are software applications that run on one or more computers to perform a specific task. Go can be used to create websites, but it is not the most ideal choice for this purpose. It is an excellent language for creating web applications that are used by engineers within a company to manage data and perform various tasks.",
