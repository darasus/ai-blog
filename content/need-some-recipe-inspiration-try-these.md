## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 1

The first challenge of the series was the Signature Bake, where contestants had to make something inspired by childhood memories.
Bready, fruity and fruity, this recipe is a great one to try with your kids. You can change the flavours to match what your little ones like. It’s a really simple recipe to follow, and it’s perfect for using up any leftover fruit. If you have a muffin tin that’s tin-less, then you can also make these into little tarts; just make sure to put some paper liners in.
Bake this for breakfast or as a snack, and serve with a dollop of yogurt or some crème fraîche.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 2

The Signature Challenge this week was a tray bake; an easy recipe to make with friends and family at home.
Biscuits are one of the best ways to use up any leftover jam. This recipe uses a classic pairing, with a strong strawberry flavour coming through. You can use any jam you like for these, but strawberry is a classic choice.
Biscuits are the perfect recipe to make at home and are great with a cuppa, afternoon tea, or crumbled and stirred into a baked yogurt for a treat.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 3

This week’s Signature Challenge was one of the trickiest yet on Bake Off: the dreaded Pasty Challenge. The contestants had to make a meat and potato pasty — an unusual combination.
The pasty is a Cornish speciality, and these ones are made with beef and hearty spuds. You can make these at home with or without a pasty tin, but a tin makes them easier to shape, and you can also use it to make individual pasties if you want to feed a crowd.
The perfect way to use up any leftover roast beef, these pasties are hearty and delicious. Serve with pickle, or a fresh salad.
