summary: "The Great British Bake Off is back with a new series of baking
  challenges. The first challenge of the series was the Signature Bake, where
  contestants had to make something inspired by childhood memories. This week’s
  Signature Challenge was one of the trickiest yet on Bake Off: the dreaded
  Pasty Challenge. The contestants were challenged to make a meat and potato
  pasty — an unusual combination. They had to create a three-tiered cake
  decorated with a novelty design or feature. These recipes are perfect for
  sharing with friends, family or even even a complete baker."
intro: >-
  Time to fire up that stove again, because this time it’s for cooking! The
  Great British Bake Off is back with a brand new batch of amateur bakers ready
  to tackle tricky challenges. Instead of the usual judges, this time we have
  Prue, Noel and Sandi testing their skills in the kitchen.

  For those who aren’t familiar with the show, The Great British Bake Off is a contest where amateur bakers are tested on their baking skills. Contestants are asked to make pastry-based dishes that often feature unusual or difficult techniques, and are judged on appearance, taste and originality. In each episode they face two different challenges: a Signature Bake where they must create something using a specific ingredient or theme as inspiration; and a Technical Challenge which might see them making croquembouche or another difficult dish.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 1

The first challenge of the series was the Signature Bake, where contestants had to make something inspired by childhood memories.
Bready, fruity and fruity, this recipe is a great one to try with your kids. You can change the flavours to match what your little ones like. It’s a really simple recipe to follow, and it’s perfect for using up any leftover fruit. If you have a muffin tin that’s tin-less, then you can also make these into little tarts; just make sure to put some paper liners in.
Bake this for breakfast or as a snack, and serve with a dollop of yogurt or some crème fraîche.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 2

The Signature Challenge this week was a tray bake; an easy recipe to make with friends and family at home.
Biscuits are one of the best ways to use up any leftover jam. This recipe uses a classic pairing, with a strong strawberry flavour coming through. You can use any jam you like for these, but strawberry is a classic choice.
Biscuits are the perfect recipe to make at home and are great with a cuppa, afternoon tea, or crumbled and stirred into a baked yogurt for a treat.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 3

This week’s Signature Challenge was one of the trickiest yet on Bake Off: the dreaded Pasty Challenge. The contestants had to make a meat and potato pasty — an unusual combination.
The pasty is a Cornish speciality, and these ones are made with beef and hearty spuds. You can make these at home with or without a pasty tin, but a tin makes them easier to shape, and you can also use it to make individual pasties if you want to feed a crowd.
The perfect way to use up any leftover roast beef, these pasties are hearty and delicious. Serve with pickle, or a fresh salad.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 4

Sandi Toksvig was challenged with making a Sweet Pie for this week’s Signature Challenge.
The perfect way to use up leftovers, sweet pies are a delicious dessert. This one is made with blackberries and almonds, but you can use any fruit you like. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or crème fraîche.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 5

This week’s Signature Challenge was a Puff Pastry Bake, with the contestants being challenged to make a colourful dish using vegetables.
Baked vegetables are a great way to eat more vegetables, and these ones are packed with flavour. This is a great meal to serve for guests, and it’s also a fantastic way to use up any leftover vegetables from the week. Serve with a simple salad and some crusty bread.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 6

The contestants focused on baking this week, with the Signature Challenge being to make a Sweet Biscuit. Bake Off fans know that biscuits are a classic way to use up leftovers, and this week’s contestants did just that.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 7

This week’s Signature Challenge was an interesting one: the contestants were challenged to make British Sandwich Recipes.
Sandwiches are a classic British snack and a perfect way to use up any leftovers you may have in the fridge. Use this recipe to make your favourite sandwiches at home.

## The Great British Bake Off — Episode 8

For the final challenge of the series, the contestants were challenged with making a Showstopper. They had to create a three-tiered cake decorated with a novelty design or feature.
