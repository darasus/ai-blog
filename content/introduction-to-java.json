The most fundamental programming language is Java. It\\u2019s one of the most important and widely used languages in the world of computer science. Many other programming languages are built on top of it, making it even more essential for coders.\nIf you want to learn Java, you first need to understand basic coding syntax. A lot of people find coding challenging because it requires fluency in a range of characters and symbols that aren\\u2019t necessarily common words in English. However, once you get past the unusual appearance of these words, you\\u2019ll see that they are actually pretty simple concepts when broken down into smaller parts. Once you understand the basics, everything becomes much easier from here on out!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
