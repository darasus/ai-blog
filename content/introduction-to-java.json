  "intro": "The history of programming languages is littered with abandoned ideas and failed attempts. That’s because creating a new programming language is a challenging process. Creating a language that has its own syntax, parser, compiler, and virtual machine is not easy. \nIt’s even harder to create a programming language that other people want to use. The Java programming language has been around for almost 25 years now, and it’s still going strong. There are many good reasons for this, but one of the most important is that Java doesn’t try to be everything to everyone. Its scope is limited, but its potential is vast.\nThis article will introduce you to the Java programming language so you can understand why it remains one of the most popular languages in the world today.",
  "content": "## Why is Java Still Relevant After 25 Years?\n\nThere are several reasons why the Java programming language still has relevance even after 25 years.\n\nFirst, Java has a massive installed base. It’s installed on billions of devices, is used by millions of businesses, and has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. This means it has a strong network effect; the more people who use it, the more useful it becomes.\nThis network effect is particularly important given the rise of other languages like Python and JavaScript. While these languages are great, they don’t have the installed base or maturity of Java.\nThis means if you want to solve business problems in the enterprise, you’ll likely end up using Java.\nJava also has a strong reputation for security. Many organizations have strict rules about what languages and technologies they allow. In these cases, Java is often the only option.\n\n## A Short History of Java\n\nThe Java programming language is old, but it wasn’t always called Java. In fact, it’s been through three name changes. Here’s a brief history of the language.\n\nIn the late 80’s, Sun Microsystems began a project to create an object-oriented language that could run on any device. That language was known as “Oak” and was designed to be portable.\n\nAt the same time, another group at Sun was working on something called “Green”. Green was designed to be secure, and a natural successor to C.\n\nUltimately, Oak was abandoned and Green was renamed “Java”.\n\nThe first version of the Java programming language was released in 1996 and became hugely popular.\n\nIn 2006, a new version of the Java language was released. This version was designed to be simpler and more secure.\n\nAs of 2019, the latest version of the Java programming language is version 9.\n\n## What Is Java?\n\nJava is a general-purpose programming language that can be run on any device. It’s used to create applications and can be used to build everything from websites to mobile apps to robots.\n\nAt its core, Java is a set of concepts and rules for writing software. A programmer writes code that can be read and understood by a machine. The Java language is a way of writing this code using words and symbols that are easy for people to understand.\n\nWhen a programmer writes code in Java, a software called a “compiler” turns that code into something that computers can read and understand. Because a compiler turns the code into an executable, you can run your code and it will do something.\n\n## The Rise of Java: Good and Bad\n\nThe popularity of the Java programming language was initially driven by its portability. This was a big deal in the 90’s when there were a lot of competing programming languages (C, C++, Perl, etc.). Many of these languages were “specialized” meaning they were designed to solve a specific computational problem.\n\nJava was different. It was designed to be “general-purpose” meaning it could be used to solve many different problems. This portability meant that programmers could create one application and run it on any device.\nThe simplicity and clarity of the language also made it easy to understand and allowed it to be adopted in a wide range of industries.\n\nAt the same time, the rise of the Java programming language was not without controversy. Many saw the language as a “bad thing”. This was particularly true for people working in the C++ community.\n\n## Confusion About Java, Android and JavaScript\n\nWhile Java remains an important and relevant programming language, it’s also the source of some confusion.\nThe most common source of confusion is between Java and JavaScript. They are similar in that they are both programming languages that can be used on the web. However, they are very different languages.\n\nJava is a general-purpose language that can be used to create anything, including websites. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a language that can only be used to write code for websites. You can’t use JavaScript to create mobile apps or robots, for example.\n\nJava has been used to create Android apps since the very early days of the smartphone. Once again, though, there’s some confusion here. The Android operating system is written in the Java programming language, but you can’t use Java to create Android apps.\n\nInstead, you need to use a language called “Android Development”.\n\n## How to Learn Java?\n\nLearning how to program can be challenging, but it’s also a rewarding skill. To become a programmer, you need to understand how to think like a computer and how to express yourself in a language that a computer can understand.\n\nWhen you’re first learning to program, it’s important to focus on one language. Trying to learn multiple languages at the same time will slow your progress. You’ll also confuse yourself and have difficulty remembering what you learned.\nThere are many good ways to learn to program in Java. You can find tutorials online or purchase a book. Popular websites like CodeCademy and Udemy also offer Java tutorials and courses. \nThis article is also a good place to start. It’s intended as a beginner’s guide to the Java programming language.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe history of programming languages is a long and winding road. It’s also one marked with failure and missed opportunities. That’s because creating a new language is a challenging process. Creating a programming language that is easy to understand and has a network effect is not easy.\n\nJava has been around for a long time, but it’s still a relevant and important language. There are many good reasons for this, but one of the most important is that it doesn’t try to be everything to everyone. Instead, it’s a general-purpose language that can solve many different computational problems. This makes it valuable, relevant, and influential."
