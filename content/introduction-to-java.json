While these languages are great, they don\\u2019t have the installed base or maturity of Java.\nThis means if you want to solve business problems in the enterprise, you\\u2019ll likely end up using Java.\nJava also has a strong reputation for security.

This was a big deal in the 90\\u2019s when there were a lot of competing programming languages (C, C++, Perl, etc.). Many of these languages were \\u201Cspecialized\\u201D meaning they were designed to solve a specific computational problem.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Java was different. It was designed to be \\u201Cgeneral-purpose\\u201D meaning it could be used to solve many different problems.
