If you take the time to understand what motivates them and reward them for good behavior, they will respond by trying harder next time.\nIf you're willing to put in the time and effort, almost any dog can be trained to sit on command. It's just a matter of identifying your dog\\u2019s motivation and rewarding him for the behaviors that you like. With consistent training sessions every day or two, your dog will learn how to sit in no time at all.\nTraining your dog doesn\\u2019t have to be difficult or stressful \\u2013 it just requires commitment and patience from both of you. The more straightforward training techniques like marker words, positive reinforcement and treat rewards should get your dog responding obediently within a few weeks.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes.

And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.
