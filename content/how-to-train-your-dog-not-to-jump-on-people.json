Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven\\u2019t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Keep in mind that you don\\u2019t want to accidentally reinforce unwanted behaviors by rewarding them with attention or treats.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Since you are trying to retrain your dog not to jump, the best place to start is with their feet.

What are they doing right before they would jump? Then, use the things you have been rewarding them with to interrupt that behavior. If you have been scratching behind the ear as a reward, do it when they would jump. If they stay calm, reward them again. If they jump, stop the reward and try again later.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Step 3: Ask your dog to sit before greeting people\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the best ways to train your dog not to jump is to ask them to sit before greeting people. Dogs are social animals, but they still need to learn proper etiquette.

Give the sit command and wait for them to sit. Once they are sitting, allow that person to approach and pet them. If they stand up or jump up, stop the petting and ask them to sit again.

However, jumping up on people can be a challenge for both dogs and the people they jump towards. A dog who jumps up on their owners might be over-excited, and a dog who jumps up on visitors may be overly anxious. These behaviours can be annoying for humans and can create problems for dogs. They may be asked to leave public places or even be given away.
