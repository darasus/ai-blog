  "summary": "This training program is meant to help your dog get used to not jumping on people. It’s not a solution to teach them how to greet people appropriately. It's important to remember that all dogs are individuals. What works for one dog might not work for another, so you need to try different methods. There are lots of ways to train dogs not to jump, but there are many ways to do it. Here are some things you can try if the program above doesn’t work for you and your dog.",
  "intro": "Do you have friends who are scared of dogs? Or perhaps you just don’t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven’t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that’s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it’s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don’t want them leaping at or something else nearby).",
  "content": "## The program\n\nThis training program is meant to help your dog get used to not jumping on people. It’s not a solution to teach them how to greet people appropriately. While you can use this program to help retrain your dog not to jump, it’s important to remember that all dogs are individuals. What works for one dog might not work for another.\nMany dogs will progress through the program in about a month. However, keep in mind that it’s a process and every dog is going to progress at a different pace. While you want to try and stay consistent with the program, if it’s taking your dog too long or you’ve hit a wall, it might be time to try a different approach.\n\n## Before you start\n\nBefore you start training your dog not to jump on people, you first need to make sure they are calm and focused around you. You should have a strong foundation of basic commands such as sit, stay, and down, as well as being able to create a positive and relaxed environment. If you don’t have a good foundation, you should take the time to build that up before beginning this program. If you do have a good foundation, you can begin the program with the next section.\n\n## Step 1: Build a foundation of actions your dog enjoys\n\nWhat do dogs like? They like to play and eat, of course. But, they also like to be cuddled, scratched, and petted. This means that you can use those things to reward good behavior. This almost acts like a clicker training approach in that you are marking the behavior you want with a reward. Keep in mind that you don’t want to accidentally reinforce unwanted behaviors by rewarding them with attention or treats.\n\nSince you are trying to retrain your dog not to jump, the best place to start is with their feet. Scratching behind the paw can be a nice reward for standing calmly while being groomed. You can also scratch behind their paw as a reward for standing still while having their nails clipped.\n\nWhen you are cuddling with your dog, try to avoid the head and neck area. If you are scratching around the dog’s ears, you can use the scratch as a reward for them standing calmly while you groom and clip their ears.\n\n## Step 2: Pay attention to triggers and rewards\n\nNow that you have a foundation of rewarding your dog for standing calmly, you need to pay attention to triggers and rewards. What do you want your dog to do when someone comes over? Do you want them to sit and stay or just to stay put? When does this typically happen? Pay attention to your dog’s body language. What are they doing right before they would jump? Then, use the things you have been rewarding them with to interrupt that behavior. If you have been scratching behind the ear as a reward, do it when they would jump. If they stay calm, reward them again. If they jump, stop the reward and try again later.\n\n## Step 3: Ask your dog to sit before greeting people\n\nOne of the best ways to train your dog not to jump is to ask them to sit before greeting people. Dogs are social animals, but they still need to learn proper etiquette. Like people, they don’t want to be crowded, grabbed, or touched by people they don’t know.\nWhen people visit your house, ask your dog to sit before allowing them to greet them. Give the sit command and wait for them to sit. Once they are sitting, allow that person to approach and pet them. If they stand up or jump up, stop the petting and ask them to sit again. Keep practicing this until they have a solid understanding of the sit command.\n\n## Step 4: Try different things and see what works for you and your dog\n\nThere are lots of ways to train dogs not to jump. You may find that one training method works for you and your dog, or you may need to try a few different methods to find one that works. Here are some things you can try if the program above doesn’t work for you and your dog.\n\n- Crate training - Crate training is a great way to retrain your dog to not jump. It gives them a safe space and a way to get their energy out without jumping on people. It can also help with potty training, since dogs are less likely to want to go in their den.\n\n- Ignore the jumping - If your dog is jumping because they are excited, the best way to calm them down is to ignore the jumping. If they are jumping because they are trying to get your attention, ignore them until they stop jumping. You can then reward them by giving them attention.\n\n- Counter conditioning - Counter conditioning is a technique where you pair something your dog doesn’t like with something they do. For example, you can pair your dog’s fear of a person with something they like. You can try this with a clicker or a remote training collar.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nDogs are social animals, and they naturally want to interact with people, including their owners and guests. However, jumping up on people can be a challenge for both dogs and the people they jump towards. A dog who jumps up on their owners might be over-excited, and a dog who jumps up on visitors may be overly anxious. These behaviours can be annoying for humans and can create problems for dogs. They may be asked to leave public places or even be given away. Fortunately, with training, you can help your dog learn to greet people in a calmer and more respectful way."
