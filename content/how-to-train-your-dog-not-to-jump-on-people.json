If not, are you looking for a way to improve? Coming when called is an essential command that most pet owners neglect. When your dog comes when called, it means he will come back to you right away and not run away or chase something else. This will help keep your dog safe, especially if he\\u2019s prone to running away or chasing objects or other animals. It also helps with training and makes everyday interactions much easier than having to constantly chase after your pet.\nBut perhaps the most important reason why you should train your dog to come when called is because it might just save his life one day. In many cases, dogs that run away don\\u2019t get lost, they are just trying to find a way back home. Therefore, knowing how to train your dog to come when called can be the difference between him coming home safe and sound or getting lost forever. And let\\u2019s face it \\u2013 nobody wants that!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
