summary: Pressure cooking uses steam to cook food quickly and efficiently, while
  preserving the nutrients in the food. Pressure cookers come to pressure when
  the water inside it reaches a certain boiling point. You can’t really cook
  food that’s meant to be “boiled” in a pressure cooker. The temperature of the
  pot will range from 100-390F, which is below the boiling temperature of water.
  The pot inside the appliance is called a “dual pressure” pot. This means that
  it can cook food at both low pressure and high pressure.

## Basics of Using an Instant Pot

The first step to any recipe is understanding how to use the recipe’s ingredient! Here are some basic things to understand about using your Instant Pot:

- The pot inside the appliance is called a “dual pressure” pot. This means that it can cook food at both low pressure and high pressure, depending on the recipe.
- The temperature of the pot will range from 100-390F, which is below the boiling temperature of water. You can’t really cook food that’s meant to be “boiled” in a pressure cooker.
- Instead, pressure cooking uses steam to cook food quickly and efficiently, while still preserving the nutrients in the food.
- This is why pressure cookers are also sometimes referred to as “steam” cookers.
- The pressure cooker will come to pressure when the water inside it reaches a certain boiling point. At this point, the steam will push against the lid so hard that the pressure inside the pot builds up until the steam can escape.

## Beans and legumes

Beans and legumes, like black beans and lentils, are a nutritional powerhouse that can be transformed by the magic of the pressure cooker. To make them in your Instant Pot, first soak your beans in water for 8 hours. Then drain and rinse them, and put them in the pot with water to cover by one inch. Set the pressure cooker to “beans” or “lentils” and wait until the timer beeps. You can add onion and garlic to the pot while the beans are cooking, if you like.

You can make a simple black bean salad by mixing together cooked beans, chopped tomato and avocado, lime juice and olive oil, chopped cilantro, and salt and pepper. A simple chili can be made by sautéing together onion and garlic, adding chili powder, cumin, and coriander. Then mix in the beans, water, and tomatoes, and simmer the mixture until it’s hot. You can make a simple vegan baked tofu using the same process as above, but with soy sauce and maple syrup instead of cumin and coriander.

## Eggs and breakfast

For a quick and healthy breakfast, try steaming some vegetables and hard-boiled eggs in your Instant Pot. You can steam vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, and cauliflower in the pot at high pressure for 2 minutes. Then lower the pressure for 2 minutes. For hard-boiled eggs, fill the pot with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Set the pressure cooker to “eggs,” and wait for the timer to go off. You can replace the vegetables or eggs with tofu or potatoes, if you like. You can also make poached eggs using a steamer basket and a bit of vinegar or lemon juice added to the water. Add some chopped vegetables or cheese to make it into a hearty breakfast omelet.

## Seafood

Here’s a simple way to use your Instant Pot to create a healthy seafood dinner. Steam some broccoli until barely tender. Add salmon fillets to the pot with water to cover by one inch. Set the pressure cooker to “fish” or “steaming,” and cook until the timer beeps. You can add a bit of soy sauce or a few slices of lemon to the water, if you like.

You can also make an easy prawn dish with garlic, chili pepper, and butter. Add the prawns to the pot with water to cover by one inch. Set the pressure cooker to “steam” and cook until the timer beeps. Add the garlic, chili pepper, and butter at the end and stir until melted.

## Chicken and meat

For a quick chicken dinner, try this recipe: steam broccoli until barely tender, add chicken breasts to the pot with water to cover by one inch, and set the pressure cooker to “meat/stew.” Wait until the timer beeps, and then add sliced mushrooms, soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil, and pepper, if you like. You can also mix in some chopped green onions.

You can also make a quick and easy chili with ground beef or ground turkey in your pressure cooker. Add the meat with water to cover by one inch. Set the pressure cooker to “meat/stew,” and cook until the timer beeps. Then add beans, tomatoes, chili powder, salt, and pepper. You can also add cumin and coriander for extra flavor.

## Vegetarian dishes

Give quick meals a vegetarian twist by mixing together vegetables with quinoa, rice, or couscous. Use vegetables like broccoli and carrots, and season with salt, pepper, and olive oil. You can also add dried cranberries or chopped almonds. You can also mix together quinoa and vegetables, like broccoli, to make a healthy and filling salad. Another easy recipe is to add beans and chopped vegetables to cooked quinoa, and then add lemon, salt, and pepper. You can also make a simple mac and cheese, where you cook pasta, add a bit of butter and milk, and then top with shredded cheese. You can also add broccoli, peas, or another vegetable for added flavor.

## Conclusion

The Instant Pot can be a great way to get more nutrients and less time spent in the kitchen. It’s also often cheaper than a traditional slow cooker! However, it’s important to understand how to use the appliance correctly, and to choose recipes that are suited to the pressure cooker.

For example, recipes that contain beans, eggs, or fish are quick and easy to cook in a pressure cooker, and are high in protein and other nutrients. They can be transformed into easy and healthy meals, and are great for beginner Instant Pot users.
