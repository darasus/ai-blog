summary: The difference between productivity and being “busy” is that being busy
  is pretty much just being frenzied and frantic with no real direction or
  purpose. Productivity, on the other hand, is the process of taking action
  towards achieving your goals and building a meaningful life. When you make
  time for productivity, you are taking the time to reflect on what your
  priorities are and then scheduling time to work towards those goals. The
  Hidden Benefit of Making Time for productivity is setting aside time to focus
  on what matters most to you.
intro: >-
  Are you one of those people who are always busy? Do you feel like there
  is never enough time in the day? Perhaps your life seems like a non-stop
  stream of errands, appointments and chores. 

  That’s because it probably is. Many of us lead fast-paced and hectic lives where there never seems to be enough time in the day. We are constantly on the go, juggling various responsibilities and appointments. In fact, for many people, “busy” has become a badge of honor—a sign that they are so important and indispensable that they can’t even spare an hour to Netflix or take out the trash without an appointment.

  But being busy isn’t always a good thing. It often means that we aren’t making time for things that are actually important, like building new relationships or dedicating time to personal development. Without making time for these things, we get caught up in the whirlwind of our everyday lives and don’t spend nearly as much time as we should focused on what matters most.

## Productivity Isn’t Just About Being “Busy”

The difference between productivity and being “busy” is that being busy is pretty much just being frenzied and frantic with no real direction or purpose. Productivity, on the other hand, is the process of taking action towards achieving your goals and building a meaningful life.

When people say they are “busy” they are often referring to their general state of frenzied over-scheduling. They are making an effort to fit as much as they can into their days and weeks, but without a clear direction or purpose. When you make time for productivity, you are taking the time to reflect on what your priorities are and then scheduling time to work towards those goals.

## Why People Don’t Make Time For Productivity

Overwhelm - One of the main reasons people don’t make time for productivity is because they are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of things they need to do. They feel like they have too much to do, and they don’t know where to even begin.

Lack of Clarity - Many people also don’t make time for productivity because they are unsure of what to actually do. They know they need to make time for those things that matter most, but they aren’t clear on what those things are.

Time Constraints - Another reason people don’t make time for productivity is due to time constraints. They may genuinely have time to do everything, but they feel like they don’t have the time to do anything well.

## The Hidden Benefit of Making Time for Productivity

When you make time for productivity, you are setting aside time to focus on your goals and what matters most to you. You are taking the time to reflect on your priorities, set goals and plan out how you are going to achieve them. You aren’t just rushing around trying to check items off your to-do list—you are taking the time to really think through what your life is about and what you want it to become.

When you make time for productivity, you can actively work towards making your life a better place. You can set and achieve meaningful goals, and you can make headway towards living the life you want to live. You can start to get in control of your life and gain a greater sense of purpose and confidence in yourself.

## 3 Ways to Make Time for Productivity

There are plenty of ways to make time for productivity. The first thing you need to do, however, is make the decision to do so. You can’t make time for productivity if you don’t decide to do so. Once you’ve made the decision, you can take a few steps to make the most of your time.

Set Your Goals - When you make time for productivity, the first thing you need to do is set your goals. You need to decide what is important to you and what you want to achieve.

Create a Plan - Once you know what your goals are, you need to create a plan for achieving them. You need to decide how you are going to make the most of your time and the best way to utilize it.

Follow Through - Finally, you need to follow through on your plan. You can set goals and make plans all you like, but unless you actually follow through and actively work towards achieving them, they won’t amount to anything.

## Bottom line

Making time for productivity isn’t just about checking things off your to-do list. It’s about taking the time to really think through what your priorities are and how you want to spend your time. It’s about making the decision to actively work towards achieving your goals and making headway towards a better life.

Instead of rushing around, constantly busy and stressed out, make the decision to make time for productivity. Once you do, you can start to take control of your life and make the most of your time and energy.
