## Company History

Apple Inc. was founded in Cupertino, California, U.S. in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The company’s first product was the Apple II computer, which was released in 1977 and was the first mass-produced computer that featured a built-in keyboard, sound and a Wozniak-designed floppy disk drive. After a number of failed attempts to adapt Apple II’s design and software for use in business settings, Jobs was fired from the company in 1985. He was then re-hired in 1996 and helped start a revolution in business and consumer technology with the introduction of the first iPod, which subsequently led to the development of the iPhone and the iPad. In 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO and was succeeded by Tim Cook, who has led Apple since then.

## The Evolution of Apple’s Logo

Apple’s original logo, used from 1976 to 1998, depicted Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. The logo was designed by Ron Wayne, who had only agreed to work with Wozniak and Jobs on the premise that he would retain the rights to the design.
The logo was replaced with the “i” logo in 1998, which was created by a design team led by Jonathan Ive. The new logo was intended to represent the company’s transition into the internet era, as well as the “intelligent” and “imaginative” qualities of its products.

The “i” logo has remained Apple’s branding to date. It has undergone various changes (e.g. the addition of a “G” in 2011 after the company’s name was changed from Apple Computer Inc. to Apple Inc.), but remains the same in concept and design. The logo is widely known for its minimalist design, as well as for the way its different elements come together to form a single “apple”.
