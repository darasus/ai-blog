summary: Apple's Airpods are the best Apple product ever made. They are easy to
  use, convenient and so fashionable that people can’t imagine living without
  them anymore. The company has built an ecosystem around its products, making
  it easy to interconnect and work with each other. The iPhone 8 is rumored to
  have wireless charging, but Apple has fallen behind in terms of wireless
  functionality, so it needs to catch up on this growing market. At $159, the
  AirPods are not exactly cheap, but the high price is expected because Apple
  prices its products higher than its competitors.
intro: >-
  Do you know why most people buy iPhones? Because they can’t stand the
  sight of Android phones. Do you know why most people buy Macs? Because they
  can’t stand the sight of Windows PCs. Do you know why most people buy iPads?
  Because they can’t stand the sight of any other tablet. 

  And do you know why most people will keep buying Apple products? Because they can’t stand the sight of anything else.

  If you think this is a general statement about Apple consumers and not something specific to their products, let us rephrase it for you with further details: Nobody on this planet buys more Apple products than the combined population of China and India. That’s right: The same countries that are portrayed as being obsessed with everything Apple also happen to be home to more poor people than anywhere else in the world.

## Airpods: The Best Apple Product Ever Made

Besides the obvious, there are two reasons why we consider Airpods to be the best Apple product ever made. The first is that these wireless headphones have already become an important part of people’s lives. They are so easy to use, so convenient and so fashionable that people can’t imagine living without them anymore. We’ve already seen people wearing Airpods to the gym, to school, to work, and even to bed. They’re that awesome. The second reason is that they are ushering in a new era of wireless audio.

## Why Are Apple Airpods So Important?

- Audio evolution: Airpods are ushering in a new era of wireless audio. We’ve seen the evolution of several technologies in the last decade, and the audio industry is next in line. Wires will no longer be the standard; they will be reserved for specific use cases like in the business world. This change has largely been made possible by two things: the proliferation of the smartphone, and the growth of Bluetooth.

- The business of streaming: This industry is projected to grow from $19 billion to $36 billion by 2021. With Airpods as the standard, Apple could have first-mover advantage in a new industry. On the other hand, if the Airpods remain wired, the company could lose out on this growing market.

## Why Are Airpods The Best Apple Product Ever Made?

- Apple’s ecosystem: The success of any product starts with its integration into other products. Apple makes it easy to link and use Airpods with other Apple products such as iPhones and iPads. The company has built an ecosystem around its products, making it easy to interconnect and work with each other.

- Wireless charging: Let’s face it: The world has become wireless. It’s not just audio that’s moving away from wires; it’s everything. Everything, that is, but charging. This is especially true of iPhones, which have remained stubbornly wired while their Android counterparts have been wireless for years. This could change with the iPhone 8.

## How Much Do Airpods Cost?

At $159, the Airpods are not exactly cheap. However, the high price is expected because Apple always prices its products higher than its competitors. What’s more important is that the Airpods are worth the price because of their quality.

The Airpods have a five-star rating on Amazon and are listed as “Amazon’s Choice.” This means customers are happy with what they bought, and the product is worth the price.

## Is the iPhone 8 Rumored to Have Wireless Charging?

Yes, we believe the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging. This is because Apple has recently acquired a startup called PowerbyProxi that specializes in wireless charging. This acquisition has led to speculation that Apple will use the technology in its upcoming iPhones.

Apple appears to be working on integrating wireless charging into the iPhone 8. This would be a first for the company, but it also makes sense. When you compare the iPhone to Android devices, it’s clear that Apple has fallen behind in terms of wireless functionality. If the company wants to stay competitive, it needs to catch up.

## Wrapping Up

Thus, it’s clear that Apple’s Airpods are more than just wireless headphones. What makes them the best Apple product ever made is the fact that they will usher in a new era of wireless audio. They’re also the perfect example of how Apple manages to stay ahead of the game by creating products that are easy to use and work with each other.
