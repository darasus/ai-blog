Manufacturers often add preservatives, artificial colors, artificial flavors, etc. These ingredients are usually less healthy than the original foods that they are altering. Unprocessed foods have a shorter shelf life and are often imported from other countries.

However, the word \\u2018processed\\u2019 can be misleading.\nProcessed foods almost always have a shorter shelf life than their unprocessed counterparts. This is because they have been altered in some way to make them last longer and to make them more convenient to consume. Processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy and unprocessed foods aren\\u2019t always healthy.\nProcessing can take many forms. Some examples of processed foods include canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, oils that have been refined or hydrogenated (as in Crisco), salt, sugar and starch that has been extracted from its original source (as in corn syrup or white sugar), spices that have been ground up, protein that has had artificial flavors or preservatives added to it (as in MSG), or food that has had artificial colors added to it (such as Red 40).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There are some nutrients like Vitamin C that are water-soluble. This means that the body can only store a little bit of this vitamin at any given time. When it runs out of its supply of Vitamin C, it takes it from the foods that you eat. Therefore, if you eat a lot of Vitamin C-rich foods, your body will be less likely to deplete its supply. However, if you eat vitamin C-rich foods that have been processed, your body will be less likely to take it from those foods. This means that you will be less likely to get the full amount of Vitamin C that you need.\nTypically, unprocessed foods are more likely to be high in the following vitamins: Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Folate, Thiamin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium and Iron.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"5 Easy Ways to Cut Out Processed Foods from Your Diet\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Plan your meals in advance.
