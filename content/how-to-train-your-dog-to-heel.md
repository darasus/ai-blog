## Start With The Basics

The first thing you need to do is get your dog comfortable. Make him feel secure and happy around you by providing him with a soft bed and some toys. Let him know that this is now his home and he is the king of the castle. Let him know that he is your best friend and that you want to be around him all the time. Once he feels at home and is relaxed, you can start with the basic commands.

These include sit, stay, come, down, and heel. You can start by simply commanding your dog to sit and stay, and then rewarding him with a treat or pat on the head when he gets it right. As you progress, you can extend the time he has to stay in position before he is rewarded.

## Reinforce Good Behaviour

You need to be consistent with your training techniques to ensure that your dog remembers and practices them over and over again without fail. This means you have to make sure that you never reward bad behaviour and always reward good behaviour with a treat.
When your dog sits, stays, or does any other command correctly, you must show your appreciation with a treat. This will help your dog associate the treat with the command and make him learn faster.

## Don’t Forget The Praise

There’s nothing wrong with using a combination of treats and praise to train your dog. In fact, this is often recommended because praise can help condition your dog to want to repeat the behaviour.
While treats are necessary during the early stages of training your dog, you can switch to praise once you have reached a certain point. This will show your dog that he is doing a good job and that you are proud of him.

## Use A Clicker Or Treats

A clicker is a handy tool that can be used during training. You can click the clicker each time your dog does something right. As he gets used to the clicker, he will learn that it means he has done something right and he will repeat the behaviour. At this stage, you can start using the clicker on its own and not with treats.
A clicker is a useful training tool because it is not something that your dog associates with food. This means that your dog won’t be distracted by the fact that you have treats in your hand.

## Don’t Use Choke Or Lead Chains

A lot of people use choke chains or lead chains to train their dogs. This is a very old-fashioned and brutal way of training a dog. Dogs are very sensitive and will feel the pain every time you pull on the chain.
Choke or lead chains are extremely harmful to your dog and should never be used. A much better and more humane way of training your dog is to use a gentle approach. Stick to the tips mentioned above and you will be able to train your dog without inflicting any pain or discomfort on him.

## Conclusion

Taking the time to train your dog is essential. It helps your dog grow comfortable being around you and your family and will reduce the risk of your dog running away or getting aggressive.
Training your dog to heel is not hard and should only take a few sessions with the right techniques. With the right tips and tricks, you can train your dog to heel in no time. 
Make sure to start with the basics, use a clicker or treats, and don’t forget the praise.
