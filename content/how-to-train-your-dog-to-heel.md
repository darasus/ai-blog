Assuming you would like an article discussing how to train a dog to heel: 

One of the first things you need to do when you get a new puppy is to start teaching them the basics of obedience. This includes learning how to heel. Heeling is when your dog walks by your side, keeping their head level with your hip and not pulling on the leash. It may seem like a lot of work at first, but with patience and consistency, you can train your dog to heel in no time. Here are a few tips on how to train your dog to heel:

1. Start with short walks around the block. This will help your puppy get used to being on a leash and walking next to you.

2. Use treats as motivation. Every time your puppy walks by your side without pulling, give them a treat.

3. Be consistent. Dogs learn best when they are given consistent commands. So, if you want your dog to heel, make sure you always use the same word or phrase, such as “heel” or “walk with me.”

4. Be patient. Like with most things in life, teaching your dog to heel takes time and patience. Don’t get frustrated if they don’t get it right away – just keep at it and eventually they will catch on.
