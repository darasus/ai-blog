## The Task

For this challenge you need to create a 1000 word article based on an experience of your own. It could be something that you have done recently or it could be something that has happened to you in the past. You need to write about it in a way that is interesting for readers though. You will also have to choose a title for your article as well as a sub-title that will appear on the search engines. You should choose a keyword for the article as well. Finally, the article should include 3 links to different websites and you need to source 2 images that you can use in the article.

## Why is this task so important?

Creating an article from scratch might seem like an easy task, but the truth is that it requires a lot of work and effort. In fact, it is a perfect way to test your ability to write more complex pieces of content since you will have to account for all of the basic elements of a good article. To create a compelling piece of content, you will have to go through the following steps:

- Pick a topic that interests you - You should want to write the article that you are creating. If you are forced to write about something that you don’t like, it will be very hard to write a good article.

- Create a title and subtitle - You should be able to summarize your article in a few words. The title and subtitle will appear on the search engines, so it is important to choose something that represents your article well.

- Do research on your topic - You don’t have to write everything from scratch. Instead, you can use your own experiences and combine them with findings from other articles to create something new. Researching your topic is a good way to get a better understanding of why you are writing about it and what you want to achieve with it.

- Write the article - This is the most important part of the process. You should try to write 1000 words as if you were writing a novel. You will have to include different sub-points, statistics and stories to create a compelling article.

## How to generate 1000 words in 30 minutes

The most important thing when writing an article from scratch is to really be in the moment. It can be extremely difficult to gather your thoughts and put them into words, so you should try to focus on the process and not get stressed when it doesn’t work all at once. You could, for example, pick up a pen and paper and write down everything you know about the topic. Once you have a few notes, you can start to draft the article and see if it works. If you are writing an article on a computer, you can use a word-processor to draft the article while you are collecting your thoughts.

## Step 1: Decide on your topic and key points

The first step of creating a good article is to pick a topic that interests you and that you know a lot about. You can use your own experiences to create content, but you will have to put yourself in the shoes of the reader to make it interesting. For example, if you have traveled to a lot of different places, you could write a travel-based article series that talks about where to visit, what you should do there and so on. If you have studied a certain subject at school, you could write an article about what you have learned that others might find interesting. It is important to know the topic like the back of your hand because you will have to write about it in a convincing way. You should try to make it as relatable as possible and focus on the benefits of your topic.

## Step 2: Write down everything you know about the topic

Once you have decided on your topic, it is time to really dig into it. The best way to do this is by creating a mindmap or flow diagram. You could also write down everything you know about the topic on a piece of paper. If you are writing the article on paper, it will help to divide the paper into sections so that you can easily move things around. The goal of this step is to create a visible overview of everything you know about your topic. You could also try to add some research you have done about the topic to the notes you have made. This will help you to create an even more thorough overview of your topic with all the different elements of it. It will also be easier to put everything together in your article later since you will have everything in front of you.

## Step 3: Draft the article based on what you already know

Now it is time to put everything you have written down together into a draft of your article. This could be a rough sketch of your article or it could be your final draft. The important thing is to just get the article started. The more you write, the better you can see what needs to be changed in your article. You should try to keep your piece of paper near you while writing so that you can easily transfer ideas from the paper to the computer. If you are typing the article on your computer, it could be useful to save your article with a new name in between writing sessions so that you don’t lose your progress.

## Conclusion

Creating an article from scratch can be a daunting task, but when you break it down into smaller parts, it can be a lot easier to create something useful. When you are writing an article from scratch, it is important to really focus on the topic and the reader that you are writing for. You should try to make your article as relatable as possible and try to keep it as short as possible without losing its meaning. The best way to create a good article is to pick a topic that interests you, write down everything you know about it and then put all of those things together in a rough draft of your article.
