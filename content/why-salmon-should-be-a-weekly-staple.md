Salmon is a delicious and nutritious fish that should be a weekly staple in your diet. Here are four reasons why:

1. Salmon is an excellent source of protein. Each 6-ounce serving of salmon provides about 40 grams of high-quality protein. This is important for maintaining muscle mass, bone health, and organ function.

2. Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats have been shown to reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and improve heart health.

3. Salmon is a good source of several vitamins and minerals. These include vitamin D, selenium, and potassium.

4. Salmon is low in mercury. This is important because mercury can be harmful to the nervous system.

So, make salmon a weekly staple in your diet and enjoy all the health benefits it has to offer!
