summary: Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been
  shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. Salmon is also a good source of the
  amino acid tryptophan, which helps regulate serotonin levels in the brain.
  Salmon can be eaten as part of a salad, sandwich, or in a small serving of
  other fish. When choosing salmon, look for wild salmon that has less than 10%
  of the daily recommended amount of saturated fat per serving. A healthy diet
  rich in calcium can help you maintain strong bones and lower your risk of
  osteoporosis and fractures.
intro: Did you grow up believing that eating fish at least once a week is good
  for you? If so, you’re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including
  reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the
  best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can’t produce on its own
  and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of
  heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain
  in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play
  a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of
  daily living), and Alzheimer’s disease. However, not all types of fish have
  the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of
  your diet.

## It’s a lean protein source

Salmon is a lean protein source, meaning that it has less than 10% of the daily recommended amount of saturated fat. Salmon is a particularly good source of the amino acid tryptophan, which has been shown to help regulate serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters that helps regulate mood, sleep, and appetite. Salmon is also a good source of B vitamins, including vitamin B12, which is needed for nerve and blood cell health.

## It’s rich in heart-healthy fats

Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. Salmon is also one of the best food sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are also known as polyunsaturated fats. Our bodies need a balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fats to help regulate cellular health. But many Western diets have an unbalanced ratio of these fats, with too few omega-3s and too many omega-6s. This can increase your risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. Getting more omega-3s and less omega-6s can help improve your health. Salmon also contains other heart-healthy fats, including monounsaturated fats and the amino acid arginine, which has been shown to help lower your blood pressure.

## It can help you meet your calcium needs

Calcium is a mineral that is essential for healthy bones and teeth. Osteoporosis and fractures are two of the biggest health issues faced by seniors. Salmon is a great source of calcium, and a healthy diet rich in calcium can help you maintain strong bones and lower your risk of osteoporosis. Getting enough calcium is especially important as you age, since your body’s metabolism changes and you may lose bone mass as you get older. Salmon is also a good source of vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption, making it a helpful addition to your diet.

## It’s packed with vitamins and minerals

Fish such as salmon is an excellent source of B vitamins and vitamin D, which are needed for many important bodily functions. These B vitamins are needed for energy production, growth, and proper metabolism. Vitamin D is needed for strong bones and teeth, cardiovascular health, and immune function. Salmon is also a good source of selenium and potassium, which are needed for cardiovascular health, and minerals like iron and zinc, which are needed for a healthy immune system.

## The benefits of salmon don’t stop there!

Salmon is also a rich source of protein and is low in fat and sodium. Protein helps build and repair muscle tissue, making it an essential part of a balanced diet for athletes and seniors. Low-fat proteins like salmon can also help you manage your weight since they’re lower in calories than other proteins. Because sodium is an important electrolyte, most people need more sodium than they’re getting in their diet, especially as they get older. However, too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, which puts you at a higher risk of stroke and heart disease.

## How to eat salmon while maintaining a healthy diet

Salmon can be a great addition to any healthy diet. It can be eaten as part of a salad, sandwich, or baked dish. Salmon can also be eaten on its own or in a small serving of other fish. When choosing salmon, look for wild salmon that has less than 10 grams of saturated fat per serving. Try to avoid salmon with added ingredients, such as a sauce or marinade, since these can add extra sodium to your meal.
