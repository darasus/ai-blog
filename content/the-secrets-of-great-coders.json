Programmers who are focused on the details of the work often find that they are not able to see the big picture. If you are always spending your time thinking about the low-level details of the code, you will never be able to achieve greatness. There are two things you need to do in order to focus on what matters. First, you need to have a vision for your code. What is the overall design? How do the modules fit together? How will the users interact with the code? Second, you must know how to prioritize your work. Some parts of the code will be more important than others. Great programmers know which parts of the work matter and which parts don\\u2019t.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Code With A Purpose\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Great coders are not just people who write code; they are people who write specific code for a specific purpose. Think about the goal of your code. You should be able to write out the goal of your code in one sentence or less. And that sentence should be clear enough that someone who doesn\\u2019t know anything about your project could understand it. So what is the goal of the code? What is the code supposed to do? If you don\\u2019t have a clear vision for the code, you may end up writing something that doesn\\u2019t work. Or, even worse, you may end up writing something that works against the rest of the code base. Great coders write code with a clear and specific purpose.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Be Passionate About Learning\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Most of the best coders are avid readers. They are constantly learning new things and improving their skills. If you want to become a great coder, you must be passionate about learning. Great coders are always reading about new technologies and new programming patterns. They never stop learning. If you want to become a great coder, you must be passionate about learning. You must want to become better every day. You must be excited to learn new things and experiment with new technologies. You must be excited to challenge yourself with difficult problems. Great coders are passionate about the process of learning. They want to learn everything they can about the technologies they are working with. They want to know what other people are doing in their field. They want to know why things work the way they do. This constant learning process is what allows great coders to adapt to new technologies quickly and solve complex problems.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Show Up And Don't Quit\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Great coders show up every day. They don\\u2019t quit when the going gets tough. They know that they need to push through the hard times in order to achieve their goals. There will always be hard times in software engineering. There will be days when you don\\u2019t know what you are doing. There will be deadlines that are looming over you. There will be coworkers who drive you crazy. There will be moments when you feel like everything is going wrong. If you want to become a great coder, you must show up for those hard days. You must push through the hard times and keep going. You must keep going even when it seems like everything is going wrong. It is easy to let go of the tough moments when everything is going right. But it takes real strength to keep going when everything is going wrong. This is the difference between the great coder and the average coder.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Know Your Tools\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Great coders know their tools inside and out.

Great coders know their tools inside and out. They don\\u2019t just know how to use the tools; they know why those tools are designed the way they are. They know the reasons why debuggers break at certain points in the code. They know the reasons why source code control systems behave the way they do. They know the reasons why integrated development environments have certain features. They know the reasons why frameworks are designed the way they are.

If you constantly doubt your ability to get the job done, you will never be productive. If you constantly doubt your ability to get the job done, you will never be productive. If you constantly doubt your ability to get the job done, you will let other people get you down. Great coders are confident in their abilities without being cocky.
