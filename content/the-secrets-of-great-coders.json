Programmers who are focused on the details of the work often find that they are not able to see the big picture. If you are always spending your time thinking about the low-level details of the code, you will never be able to achieve greatness. There are two things you need to do in order to focus on what matters. First, you need to have a vision for your code. What is the overall design? How do the modules fit together? How will the users interact with the code? Second, you must know how to prioritize your work. Some parts of the code will be more important than others. Great programmers know which parts of the work matter and which parts don\\u2019t.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Code With A Purpose\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Great coders are not just people who write code; they are people who write specific code for a specific purpose.

If you don\\u2019t have a clear vision for the code, you may end up writing something that doesn\\u2019t work.

You must want to become better every day. You must be excited to learn new things and experiment with new technologies. You must be excited to challenge yourself with difficult problems. Great coders are passionate about the process of learning. They want to learn everything they can about the technologies they are working with.

There will be moments when you feel like everything is going wrong. If you want to become a great coder, you must show up for those hard days. You must push through the hard times and keep going.
