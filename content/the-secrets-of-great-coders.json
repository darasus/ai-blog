If you are always spending your time thinking about the low-level details of the code, you will never be able to achieve greatness. There are two things you need to do in order to focus on what matters. First, you need to have a vision for your code. What is the overall design? How do the modules fit together?

Great coders are passionate about the process of learning. They want to learn everything they can about the technologies they are working with.

This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another. This is called inheritance in Java. It is one of the cornerstones of OOP programming and something that every serious programmer should know well.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
