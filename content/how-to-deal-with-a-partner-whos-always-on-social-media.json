Because it\\u2019s easy to be rude and inconsiderate when you\\u2019re behind a screen, many people use dating apps as a way to treat others poorly. It can be especially hard to deal with if your partner decides to start dating multiple people at once, and they use these apps to do so.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Even if your partner is respectful and honest when they\\u2019re using dating apps, there are still reasons why you might not enjoy hearing about their experiences.
