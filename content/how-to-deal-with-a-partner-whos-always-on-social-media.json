There\\u2019s shopping, traveling and entertaining to consider. And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful.

If left unattended, this dirt and oil will cause your dog to smell and leave them more susceptible to infections. Grooming your dog regularly can also help you identify any problems they might have with their skin or fur early on. To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every one to three months.\nThe benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence. The process is not only beneficial for the dog but also for you as an owner as it gives you time to build a stronger bond with your pet.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
