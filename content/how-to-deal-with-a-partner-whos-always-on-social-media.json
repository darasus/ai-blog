Figuring out if someone is your soulmate or simply the first step to becoming one isn\\u2019t easy. Even though it can feel like we\\u2019re constantly being bombarded with images of fairy tale love and meet-cute romances, dating in real life isn\\u2019t always so straightforward.

But it\\u2019s not! A relationship coming to an end does not mean there is something wrong with you or that you aren\\u2019t good enough for anyone or that you will never find love again.
