## What is batch cooking?

Batch cooking is the process of making large amounts of healthy food at one time and freezing or refrigerating for future use. This can be done with just about any type of food, but it is most commonly done with stews and soups. All you have to do is make a large amount of your favorite recipe, put it in containers, and store it in the refrigerator or freezer until you are ready to eat it again.
Batch cooking is a great way to make the most of your time while also saving money. Since you are making a larger amount of food at one time, you can save money by buying ingredients in bulk. You can also use your time more efficiently. Instead of spending several hours each week going to the grocery store and squeezing in cooking time around all of your other activities, you can make a week’s worth of food in one or two days.
Batch cooking also helps you avoid the common pitfalls of quick meals. When you make food at home, you can be sure that it is made with healthy ingredients and without preservatives or unhealthy additives. You also have a lot more control over portion sizes when you make food at home.
