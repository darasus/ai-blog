intro: >-
  The process of mediation is the practice of assisting parties in a
  conflict to find common ground and reach a mutually agreeable resolution.
  Mediation isn’t just for couples who are breaking up or divorcing; it can be
  useful in resolving disputes with co-workers, business partners, friends or
  family members.

  Mediation is cost-effective and time-efficient, reducing the potential for long legal battles and the financial and emotional costs that go with them. In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person’s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.

  Additionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial. If you’re interested in learning more about this resolution process as a way to manage your own conflict or as an advisor if you are working with someone who needs help resolving their dispute, read on. Here we will explore some benefits of mediation:

## It Helps You Understand The Situation From All Angles

When you are in the midst of a conflict, it’s easy to get caught up in your own feelings and the emotions of the situation. While it’s important to be aware of your feelings, it’s also important to put yourself in the other person’s shoes. If you were accused of something you didn’t do, you would want the other person to understand your side of the story. Mediation allows you to understand the other person’s story and see if there are any areas of miscommunication.

Mediation is a process that allows each person in the dispute to express their side of the story. The mediator will help each person ask questions of the other person and facilitate conversation between the two of you. With mediation, you will have the time and space to fully share your story, so the other person can understand it completely. You’ll be able to ask questions and clarify any information you don’t understand. You’ll also have the chance to tell your story and understand the other person’s side of the situation.

## Mediation Is In-Person Communication

When people communicate in person, they tend to be more positive, open, and expressive. This communication style is less likely to create a negative reaction than written communication. When communicating in person, you can observe the other person’s expressions and body language to help you interpret the message they are trying to send. This type of communication is less likely to lead to miscommunication or misinterpretation than written communication.

When you are in mediation, you and the other party are able to communicate directly and ask questions of each other. You can see the other person’s nonverbal communication, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. Nonverbal communication can help you understand the other person’s emotions and intentions.

## It Helps Build Relationships

The process of mediation helps you and the other person in the dispute understand each other’s situation and come to a reasonable resolution. It can also help you establish a more positive relationship with the other person by showing that you are willing to compromise and come to an agreement.
While conflict is normal and healthy, it can be difficult to resolve a disagreement. Mediation is an effective way to work through issues and come to a mutually beneficial solution. If you and the other party come to an agreement, you’ll be more likely to follow through with it than you would if you court ordered a settlement.

## It Can Be Confidential And Allows For Handling Issues Privately

Confidentiality is a major benefit of mediation. If you are dealing with a sensitive issue, such as sexual harassment, mediation can help keep the details private. Mediation allows you to discuss sensitive issues in private. If you need to discuss confidential issues, mediation can help keep the information private.

While mediation is often used in family law disputes, it can be used to resolve issues in any field or segment of society. Issues that are better handled confidentially or privately include things like child custody issues or child support, child abuse, sexual harassment, and discrimination. Mediation allows you to discuss these issues in private and reach an agreement that can be implemented without a court order.

## Mediation Is A Fast Process

Depending on the complexity of the situation, a mediation session could end in an hour or two. In the majority of cases, it takes less time to mediate a dispute than it would to take it through the court system.
When you and the other person reach an agreement during mediation, you can end the dispute with one conversation. You don’t have to write a detailed contract or work with a lawyer to draw up and file legal documents. You can sign an agreement at the mediation session and go on with your life.
