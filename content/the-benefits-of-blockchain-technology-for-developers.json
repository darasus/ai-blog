From e-books to login IDs, everything is becoming digital.

The ability to read and understand code as well as develop new software is a skill that won\\u2019t go out of fashion anytime soon. However, there are plenty of other skills that will be even more valuable in the coming years, such as the ability to use emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlmost everyone has heard about blockchain technology thanks to its usage in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . But what exactly is blockchain technology? A blockchain is a digital ledger that allows users to make secure transactions without the need for a third party or intermediary such as a bank or broker.\nLet\\u2019s take a look at some examples of how you can use blockchain technology for development either now or in the future.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is a very useful application of blockchain technology, and it\\u2019s one that many businesses are starting to use. Using a smart contract, you can create terms and conditions for a client and then have that agreement verified by the blockchain and stored in a distributed ledger. This process makes the entire contractual process more secure and transparent while also cutting down on the time and cost of traditional contracting. These smart contracts can also help you to create decentralized apps (DApps).\nIn fact, we\\u2019ve already seen them in action. For example, both the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the token for the decentralized exchange called Etherex have been built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and utilise smart contracts in their functionalities. In the future, we\\u2019ll almost certainly see even more businesses and organizations use smart contracts as this technology improves and becomes more accessible to a wider range of people.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Decentralized Cloud Storage\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A decentralized cloud storage system is one where the data is distributed across a network of computers, usually in different geographical locations. This means that no one entity has control over your data, and they can\\u2019t deny you access to it either. It\\u2019s a concept that\\u2019s core to blockchain technology, and you can use it to create a decentralized storage system that allows people to store information in a secure, encrypted fashion. Some decentralized storage systems are also open source, which means that anyone can make changes to the code and improve the system. This is something that you could build into your decentralized cloud storage system to make it even more secure and robust. If you\\u2019re developing a decentralized file storage solution, it\\u2019s worth considering a system that\\u2019s based on blockchain technology. This can offer you a high level of security, and many decentralized storage systems are also peer-to-peer networks, which means they are completely decentralized and don\\u2019t rely on a single server or computer.

With blockchain technology, you can create a decentralized network that allows people to securely verify their identity. This network could be used by companies conducting KYC checks or by governments who need to track criminals and terrorists. If you\\u2019re creating an identity verification system based around blockchain technology, it\\u2019s important to consider the privacy of the users. After all, you want people to feel safe verifying their identity, but also be aware of the security risks involved.

However, once goods have reached their destination, it\\u2019s possible to track them through this decentralized network to make the entire shipping process more transparent and secure. You can also use this decentralized network to track and record the origin of products such as food thanks to blockchain technology\\u2019s ability to store data and verify each item through a digital fingerprint.

It\\u2019s a system that allows businesses to outsource some of their AI needs, which can help to make the technology more affordable and accessible. These decentralized AI networks also make the system more secure, as there is no single point of failure. If you\\u2019re interested in using blockchain technology to develop AI, it\\u2019s important to know that the technology is still new and unproven in many respects.
