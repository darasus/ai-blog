However, there are plenty of other skills that will be even more valuable in the coming years, such as the ability to use emerging technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlmost everyone has heard about blockchain technology thanks to its usage in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin .

This process makes the entire contractual process more secure and transparent while also cutting down on the time and cost of traditional contracting. These smart contracts can also help you to create decentralized apps (DApps).\nIn fact, we\\u2019ve already seen them in action. For example, both the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the token for the decentralized exchange called Etherex have been built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and utilise smart contracts in their functionalities.

Some decentralized storage systems are also open source, which means that anyone can make changes to the code and improve the system. This is something that you could build into your decentralized cloud storage system to make it even more secure and robust. If you\\u2019re developing a decentralized file storage solution, it\\u2019s worth considering a system that\\u2019s based on blockchain technology. This can offer you a high level of security, and many decentralized storage systems are also peer-to-peer networks, which means they are completely decentralized and don\\u2019t rely on a single server or computer.

This network could be used by companies conducting KYC checks or by governments who need to track criminals and terrorists. If you\\u2019re creating an identity verification system based around blockchain technology, it\\u2019s important to consider the privacy of the users.

However, once goods have reached their destination, it\\u2019s possible to track them through this decentralized network to make the entire shipping process more transparent and secure. You can also use this decentralized network to track and record the origin of products such as food thanks to blockchain technology\\u2019s ability to store data and verify each item through a digital fingerprint.
