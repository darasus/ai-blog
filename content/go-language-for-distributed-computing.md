summary: Go is a language used for general purpose programming and distributed
  computing. It was created at Google, and then open sourced to the public in
  2009. Go is designed to be efficient in terms of memory use and speed. This
  makes it ideal for distributed computing because it relies on the collective
  processing power of many computers at once. Go’s built-in libraries allow
  developers to build machine learning functionality into their apps, making the
  language ideal for use cases like image recognition, natural language
  processing, and more.
intro: >-
  Knowing the right tool for the job is essential to efficiency and
  performance. Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals
  with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with
  them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing
  power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big
  data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
  neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing. 

  A great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it’s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.

## What is Go Language?

Go is a language used for general purpose programming and distributed computing. It was created at Google, and then open sourced to the public in 2009.
Go is a compiled language, meaning that the code you write and the application you create are turned into machine code for the computer to read and then run. Code can be compiled for many different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.
Go is a high-level programming language, meaning that it is designed to be easy to read and write.
It is also considered a compiled, static language (meaning that it does not run on a runtime like Python does). This makes it more efficient as it does not have to parse and re-parse code at runtime like Python does.

## Why use Go for Distributed Computing?

Go is designed to be efficient in terms of memory use and speed. This makes it ideal for distributed computing because it relies on the collective processing power of many computers at once.
Go is a compiled language, and compiled languages are generally more efficient than languages that are interpreted (like Python).
Distributed computing involves breaking down tasks into parts that can be run on different machines at once. Go’s built-in concurrency features make this easy to do.
Go was created by Google, and Google has years of experience with distributed computing. This means that Go is well-suited to distributed computing, and Google’s knowledge can be applied to various distributed computing tasks.

## Go for Machine Learning

Machine learning uses computer algorithms to process and analyze large amounts of data to make predictions or draw conclusions. Go’s efficient memory use and its built-in libraries for distributed processing make it a great language for machine learning.
Go’s built-in libraries allow developers to build machine learning functionality into their apps, making the language ideal for use cases like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
Computer scientists can also use Go to create their own algorithms for machine learning. Since Go is open sourced, and the language is easily readable and understandable, anyone can examine the code and learn from it.
Go’s efficient memory use and distributed processing also make it a great language for big data.

## Go for Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is the study and implementation of computer algorithms that allow computers to interpret and analyze written human language like text and speech. Go’s efficient memory use and distributed processing make it a great language for natural language processing.
Go’s built-in libraries make it easy to implement natural language processing functionality into apps.
Natural language processing can be used for a variety of purposes, including speech recognition, text summarization, language translation, and more.
Those who are creating their own algorithms for natural language processing can use Go to do so. The algorithms created in Go can then be applied to whatever problem the user is trying to solve.

## Go for Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines through algorithms. Go can be used to create the algorithms for artificial intelligence.
Go’s efficient memory use and distributed processing make it a great language for artificial intelligence.
Go’s built-in libraries make it easy to create AI functionality into apps.
Artificial intelligence can be used for a variety of different purposes, including image recognition, weather forecasting, stock market analysis, and more.

## Summary

Distributed computing requires specific tools and technologies. Go is a great language to use for distributed computing because it is efficient in terms of memory use and speed. This makes it ideal for distributed computing because it relies on the collective processing power of many computers at once. Go is a compiled language, and compiled languages are generally more efficient than languages that are interpreted. Distributed computing involves breaking down tasks into parts that can be run on different machines at once. Go’s built-in concurrency features make this easy to do. Go was created by Google, and Google has years of experience with distributed computing. This means that Go is well-suited to distributed computing, and Google’s knowledge can be applied to distributed computing tasks.

Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.
