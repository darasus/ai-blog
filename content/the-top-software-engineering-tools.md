intro: >-
  Software engineering is a dynamic field with a wide range of tools
  available to streamline processes and accelerate productivity. Software
  engineers need to be constantly on the lookout for new tools that make their
  lives easier and their work more efficient.

  If you’re a software engineer, chances are you frequently juggle multiple projects, apps, and codebases — all while keeping track of specific details like version numbers, dependencies, and APIs. It can be challenging to keep all those details straight in your head, let alone find them when you need them again later on. That’s why many software engineers turn to specialized software engineering tools that streamline everyday processes and accelerate efficiency. 

  With so many options out there, it can be challenging to determine which software engineering tools will help streamline your workflow most efficiently. This article covers some of the top software engineering tools from various categories including IDE

## Language support: An essential tool for developers

If you work with a programming language, you’ll likely want to use a language support service. Language support tools, such as linting and code analysis, help you write code that is more consistent, reusable, and standard in format. They also help you avoid syntax and other errors that can get in the way of your work.
These software engineering tools are especially useful if you work with a programming language that requires specific formatting, such as JavaScript ( which is often formatted with a “code convention” called the JavaScript Code Conventions ) or Python. With language support tools, you can format your code according to the convention so that others can understand it easily.

## Code editors

Most developers will have a preference when it comes to the code editor of choice, but there are many benefits to consider when choosing the right one for you. There are a number of key factors to keep in mind when shopping for a code editor including: Source code syntax highlighting and auto-completion - can help ensure your code is formatted and written correctly.

Integrated debugging tools - can help you quickly find and fix bugs.

Project management and collaboration - can help you stay organized and in-the-know with regards to team members’ progress.

Source control integration - can help you keep track of and manage code changes.

## Version control software

Version control software is an essential tool for managing changes to code — particularly on large, collaborative projects. It organizes the process by which developers “check out” code they want to edit and “check in” any changes they make. This way, it’s easy to track changes to code and revert to previous versions if necessary.
For most developers, using version control software is an essential part of their workflow — but it’s important to choose the right tool for the job. Some of the top options include: Git - a popular, distributed version control system that is used for source code management and host the majority of open-source projects.

Mercurial - a distributed system used mainly by academia.

## Continuous integration and delivery tools

Many software engineers choose to integrate continuous integration and delivery tools into their workflow. Continuous integration is a process that involves automatically testing new code as soon as it’s added. You can also use these tools to automatically deploy code once it’s been approved.
There are many different CI/CD tools available, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Some of the most popular include: Jenkins - a continuous integration and continuous delivery server used by many companies that employ a DevOps culture.

GitHub - a centralized platform for managing code repos and integrating CI tools like Jenkins.

## Debugging tools

If you’re more of a “debug as you go” type of person, you might not need dedicated debugging tools. However, if you prefer to iron out bugs as you find them, you might benefit from using debugging tools.
You can use debugging tools to track down bugs and errors quickly and easily. Some of the most popular debugging tools include: Breakpoints - these are used to pause a program so that you can see what’s happening at a specific moment in time.

Logging - these are used to log specific events, errors, and other details.

## API Development Tools

If you work with APIs, you’ll likely want to use API development tools. API development tools, such as API frameworks and code generators, help you create and manage APIs.
They’re incredibly helpful for managing API dependencies and ensuring that your API is properly formatted and easy to navigate. For example, API frameworks like API Builder allow you to create an API without writing the code. API code generators, like Postman, are another helpful way to create and manage APIs. These generate API code based on a request and allow you to test and edit your API without needing to write the code.

## Summing up

When selecting a software engineering tool, it’s important to consider how it will fit into your existing workflow. You should also keep in mind how often you’ll use the tool and how easy it is to integrate into your current processes.
You can also consider how it will improve your team’s workflow — will it help make your team more efficient? Will it help facilitate better collaboration?
You don’t have to choose just one software engineering tool. In fact, it’s often beneficial to use several tools that serve various functions. That way, you can customize your workflow to suit your specific needs.
