intro: >-
  Exercising is definitely not everyone’s cup of tea. In fact, most of us
  would rather stay indoors and avoid sweating at all costs. However, if you
  want to lead a healthy lifestyle, exercising is an essential part of your
  routine. But with so many excuses for not working out, how do you motivate
  yourself to exercise? 

  Citizens of the world are becoming lazier by the day. We spend more time watching TV, browsing the Internet, and playing video games than ever before. And it’s no wonder — these activities are incredibly sedentary and don’t exactly burn a lot of calories or leave you feeling very invigorated afterwards. 

  Exercise can be a tricky thing to get motivated for. There might be days where you feel like nothing can get you off the couch and other days when it feels like the best thing in the world — but how do you find that happy medium between being active and a sloth?

## Know what works for you

Before you can start getting motivated to exercise, you have to know which exercises work for you. What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Which activities leave you feeling invigorated? Which ones leave you feeling exhausted? Keeping a journal of your workouts is a great way to figure out what exercises work for you. It also gives you a place to reflect on your progress and keep track of how you’re improving over time. If you don’t know where to start, you can refer to this article that breaks down the best exercises for every part of your body.

## Start small

Exercising is not something that happens over night. It’s something that you develop a habit of over time as you gradually build up your strength, endurance, and willpower. It’s important that you don’t try to do too much too soon. If you try to push yourself too hard too quickly, you’ll end up burning out and giving up. You’ll also risk injury and that’s the last thing we want. Start small, work up a routine, and go from there.

## Find your exercise “drug”

We all have our vices — things that we habitually do that aren’t exactly good for us — but we don’t have the willpower or drive to stop. You may have a similar thing going on with exercise. Maybe you’re addicted to the way it makes you feel, perhaps you live for the rush you get from a challenging workout, or maybe you feel like it’s incredibly important for your mental health. Whatever it is, find your exercise “drug” and use it to motivate yourself to exercise.

## Set concrete goals

Exercising is something you do to improve your health and fitness levels, but it’s also a goal in and of itself. What are your fitness goals? Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to build muscle? Do you want to run a marathon? Whatever your goal is, don’t let it go. Stay focused on it and use it as a motivating factor to help you get through the hard times. What can you do today to move one step closer to your fitness goal?

## Make it a ritual

Some people meditate. Others read a book. There are tons of different ways to unwind, relax, and de-stress. You may have a ritual that you perform every day — but what about an exercise ritual? What do you do every day (or at least multiple times per week) to get yourself fit? Exercise should always be a part of your routine. 

## Find a running buddy or partner

Exercising with a friend or partner can be a great motivator. If you have a friend or family member who likes to work out, invite them to go with you. Alternatively, you can look online and find a running buddy or partner who shares your interests and motivations. Having someone you can go out and exercise with can make a huge difference when you’re struggling to motivate yourself to work out. It can be incredibly helpful to have someone to talk to and share your experience with.

## Don’t forget why you’re exercising

Finally, don’t forget why you’re exercising in the first place. Why are you working so hard to improve your health? What benefits does it have? Why does it matter if you don’t like exercising? If you can figure out why you’re exercising in the first place, you’ll find it much easier to stay motivated throughout the whole process.

Exercising is a necessary part of any healthy lifestyle. It’s one of the best ways to stay active, improve your mental health, and stay fit as you get older. If you want to lead a healthy life, you have to get up off the couch and start moving. However, getting motivated to exercise can be a tricky thing — but it can be done. Follow these tips, use the advice listed above, and you’ll be fit in no time.
