intro: >-
  In an increasingly digital world, demand for skilled coders is only
  growing. There are now more coding resources than ever before; however, this
  can make it challenging to know where to start learning and developing your
  skills. If you’re interested in coding but aren’t sure where to begin, you’re
  not alone. Many individuals feel the same way about coding as you do.
  Fortunately, there are many great resources to get started with coding and
  continue learning what you need to know. 

  These days it doesn’t take a lot of money or time to learn how to code online, whether at home or as part of a formal education program. You can find free tutorials on websites like Codecademy or Treehouse, or complete courses on platforms like Udemy or Alison. While it can seem overwhelming with so many different options available and no single right answer as to which one is best for you personally, the truth is that all of these resources are great in different ways.

## CodeAcademy

CodeAcademy is a free online coding tutorial that teaches students how to code in a variety of languages, including HTML and CSS. It’s a great place to start if you don’t have any experience with coding at all. The site offers interactive lessons that allow you to type in code and see what happens to it on your computer screen. You can also test your knowledge with exercises. CodeAcademy organizes its lessons by language, which makes it easy to navigate to the things you need to learn. The site also has a helpful blog full of tips and tricks.

What might turn some people off about CodeAcademy, though, is that it doesn’t focus on any one language. Instead, it teaches lots of different coding skills at once. While this might be helpful for you in the long run, it’s not the best place for beginners to start. CodeAcademy might be a better fit for you if you already know a bit of coding and want to expand your skills.

## Codecademy

Codecademy is another free online coding tutorial that teaches people how to code in a variety of languages. The site has interactive lessons that are easy to follow, and it also provides exercises to check your understanding of the concepts. Codecademy organizes its lessons by language, but unlike CodeAcademy, it focuses on teaching one language. While this might make it easier to learn one skill at a time, it might not help people who want to learn several skills at once like CodeAcademy does.

Although Codecademy is a good site for beginners, it has a reputation for being difficult to use. There have been complaints that the site’s interface is confusing and difficult to navigate. There have also been complaints about the difficulty of the exercises. Because of these downsides, Codecademy might be a better fit for people with some coding experience.

## Coursera

Coursera offers a variety of free online coding classes from top-notch universities and other organizations. The site has a wide range of programming languages and topics, including Python and JavaScript. Coursera’s classes are self-paced, which means you can learn at your own pace. Some of the classes also include assessments, which you can use to track your progress. Coursera’s courses are usually similar to what you would find in a real-life college or university course, but often with less content. One drawback of Coursera is that it doesn’t offer a place to practice typing in code. If you want to practice typing, you’ll need to find a different site. Coursera is a great site for people who want to learn real skills and build a portfolio of work they can show off later.

## edX

edX is another online coding class website. It offers a wide variety of coding language classes, including C++ and Python. EdX’s classes are self-paced and free, making it an affordable way to learn. The site also has a helpful online community full of people who are studying the same topics as you are. One drawback of edX is that its course materials aren’t as organized as some other resources, making it difficult to find what you need when you want to learn a skill. EdX is a great place for people who want to learn real skills but don’t want to pay for a full course.

## FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is a free website that teaches people how to code in all different types of programming languages. Unlike many of the other coding websites and tutorials, it doesn’t start out at the beginning. Instead, it assumes that you already have some basic coding experience and starts with more advanced topics. While this can be challenging for beginners, it can also be helpful for people who have struggled with other online tutorials. FreeCodeCamp has a helpful online community, but one drawback of the site is that it doesn’t offer much in the way of online quizzes or assessments to track your progress. If you’re looking for a site that will give you a clear path to building real skills, FreeCodeCamp might be a good option.

## Google Developers Course: Google Codelabs

Google’s website has a wide variety of online coding tutorials that teach people how to code in a wide range of skills. The site has many interactive tutorials, making it easy to understand how to use and apply the skills you’re learning. Google also has a helpful online community where people can share what they’ve learned and get help with difficult concepts. One drawback of Google’s online tutorials is that they often don’t give people everything they need to build a real skill. If you learn a skill from Google and want to show it off to a potential employer, you might need to find outside resources to make it complete. Google’s tutorials are a good place to start learning real coding skills.

## Rookie Up!

Rookie Up! is a free website that teaches people how to code in a variety of different languages. The site’s tutorials are easy to follow and include many interactive elements. Rookie Up! also has a helpful online community that can help you learn new skills and understand difficult concepts. One drawback of Rookie Up! is that it doesn’t offer any assessments or quizzes to track your progress, so it can be hard to gauge how well you’re doing. If you’re looking for a free and easy-to-navigate website where you can learn real skills, Rookie Up! is a good option.
