It\\u2019s a way to request information from a server, usually in the form of a JSON payload. It\\u2019s been around for a while, growing in popularity every year since its introduction in 2015. It\\u2019s been used for everything from apps to websites, and is quickly becoming a standard for API development.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"All of that sounds pretty simple, but like any technology, it\\u2019s more complicated than it appears at first glance. So, let\\u2019s break it down. GraphQL is a data querying language. That means that you use this language to access data from a server. That data is stored in a database, and that database can be anywhere: a server on your company\\u2019s network, a cloud service like Amazon Web Services, or a third-party API.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Use GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems. Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier to find exactly what you\\u2019re looking for and allowing the front-end to specify the exact data it needs. The front-end is usually the user\\u2019s browser, but it could be any app accessing data. If a company\\u2019s marketing team wants to see a list of current customers or current campaigns, they could use GraphQL to request that data with one call instead of logging into several different systems, each with its own interface and its own set of instructions for getting that data.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is GraphQL so great?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One reason is that GraphQL minimizes the server calls needed for a given operation. If you access data using REST, you have to make one call for each thing you want. If you access that data using GraphQL, you only have to make one call for everything. On the surface, that doesn\\u2019t seem like a big difference \\u2013 but it changes everything behind the scenes. Imagine you have a website where the homepage has 10 different widgets: widgets that display data, widgets that let your visitors sign in, widgets that let them log out. With a REST API, your website has to go through 10 different endpoints to get all of those widgets. With GraphQL, it goes through one.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Learn More About GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to get started with GraphQL is to use it.

You can also reach out to developer communities like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow for help.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Wrapping up\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"GraphQL has been growing in popularity for years. It\\u2019s easy to understand, easy to use, and promises to remove many of the headaches inherent in working with data. This is a great time to start learning about GraphQL, whether you\\u2019re a developer or a product manager.

Whatever your reason for investigating coding, Python is an excellent place to start learning about computer programming and creating your own programs.\nCoding is often a seemingly inaccessible skill, reserved for those with a knack for mathematics or sciences. However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding. The key is finding the right resources and a step-by-step learning process that doesn\\u2019t feel like a burdensome chore.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to begin exploring the wonderful world of Python coding, read on to learn more.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so. Let us explore how we can leverage interfaces in our code to make it more modular, reusable, testable and readable.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
