So, let\\u2019s break it down. GraphQL is a data querying language. That means that you use this language to access data from a server. That data is stored in a database, and that database can be anywhere: a server on your company\\u2019s network, a cloud service like Amazon Web Services, or a third-party API.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Use GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems. Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier to find exactly what you\\u2019re looking for and allowing the front-end to specify the exact data it needs. The front-end is usually the user\\u2019s browser, but it could be any app accessing data.

If you access data using REST, you have to make one call for each thing you want. If you access that data using GraphQL, you only have to make one call for everything. On the surface, that doesn\\u2019t seem like a big difference \\u2013 but it changes everything behind the scenes. Imagine you have a website where the homepage has 10 different widgets: widgets that display data, widgets that let your visitors sign in, widgets that let them log out.

With GraphQL, it goes through one.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Learn More About GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to get started with GraphQL is to use it.

However, when it comes to creating an application with Spring MVC, the options are virtually limitless.\nIn this blog post we will take a look at various examples of Spring MVC applications.

In fact, IDC estimates that worldwide public cloud services will grow from $206 billion in revenue in 2017 to $345 billion by 2021. New types of cloud services are also emerging every day.\nA majority of organizations now use cloud services as part of their IT strategy. From handling peak demand to reducing costs and improving availability, cloud-based services have proven their worth for many businesses. Even so, making the move can be challenging for IT professionals and software developers. There are several considerations when choosing which programming language is best for creating software applications for the cloud, including the following:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Working with files in Java can seem a little counterintuitive at first. Once you understand what makes it different from other programming languages, it becomes much clearer.\nWorking with files in Java involves creating, reading, updating and deleting files. Files are stored as strings or bytes. If you have used other programming languages before, this will be familiar to you. In Java, there are two separate ways of working with files: standard streams and the new \"File\" class introduced in version 1.1 of the language. This article explains how to work with files using both methods and also touches on some related topics such New>.../New> tags and Jar archives (self-executable packages).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
