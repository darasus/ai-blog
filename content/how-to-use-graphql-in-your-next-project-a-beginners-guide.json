  "summary": "GraphQL is a data querying language that lets you access data from a server. It’s been around for a while, growing in popularity every year since its introduction in 2015. GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems. Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for and allow the front end to specify the exact data it needs.",

It\\u2019s an alternative to REST APIs that opens up entire datasets instead of just individual endpoints. That means that instead of asking for data about users, their profile, or their account separately \\u2014 as though each piece was in its own locked room \\u2014 you can ask for Users> and get back every user on the site at once with no additional steps or roadblocks. Users> . . . and Profile> . . . and Account> \\u2013 all unlocked at once. And while that sounds like a lot more work, it actually means less work overall because the dataset is so much smaller and simpler than with traditional APIs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s a way to request information from a server, usually in the form of a JSON payload. It\\u2019s been around for a while, growing in popularity every year since its introduction in 2015. It\\u2019s been used for everything from apps to websites, and is quickly becoming a standard for API development.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"All of that sounds pretty simple, but like any technology, it\\u2019s more complicated than it appears at first glance. So, let\\u2019s break it down. GraphQL is a data querying language. That means that you use this language to access data from a server. That data is stored in a database, and that database can be anywhere: a server on your company\\u2019s network, a cloud service like Amazon Web Services, or a third-party API.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Use GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems. Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier to find exactly what you\\u2019re looking for and allowing the front-end to specify the exact data it needs. The front-end is usually the user\\u2019s browser, but it could be any app accessing data. If a company\\u2019s marketing team wants to see a list of current customers or current campaigns, they could use GraphQL to request that data with one call instead of logging into several different systems, each with its own interface and its own set of instructions for getting that data.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is GraphQL so great?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One reason is that GraphQL minimizes the server calls needed for a given operation. If you access data using REST, you have to make one call for each thing you want. If you access that data using GraphQL, you only have to make one call for everything. On the surface, that doesn\\u2019t seem like a big difference \\u2013 but it changes everything behind the scenes. Imagine you have a website where the homepage has 10 different widgets: widgets that display data, widgets that let your visitors sign in, widgets that let them log out. With a REST API, your website has to go through 10 different endpoints to get all of those widgets. With GraphQL, it goes through one.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Learn More About GraphQL?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to get started with GraphQL is to use it. If you\\u2019re building a new site, try implementing GraphQL, or if you\\u2019re working with an existing project, try to see if you can integrate it. You can also check out GraphQL\\u2019s documentation, which is extensive and easy to navigate.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can also check out blog posts and videos from other developers who have learned about GraphQL, as well as podcasts and newsletters. You can also reach out to developer communities like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow for help.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Wrapping up\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"GraphQL has been growing in popularity for years. It\\u2019s easy to understand, easy to use, and promises to remove many of the headaches inherent in working with data. This is a great time to start learning about GraphQL, whether you\\u2019re a developer or a product manager. It\\u2019s a tool that can make your job easier, and it\\u2019s an important part of the future of data management and retrieval.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
