There\\u2019s a lot of information out there on Apple Inc and its products, but not all of it is useful. Let\\u2019s be honest: When was the last time you used an Apple device to learn about the company itself? Probably never. The tricky thing about having so many devices from one company is that it can be hard to find information that applies directly to each device as an individual unit. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve compiled this guide - to show you how to make the most of your Apple device by accessing its hidden features, customizing it to fit your needs, and keeping track of everything important in one place.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.
