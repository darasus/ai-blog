From naming conventions to formatting standards, there are a ton of rules and best practices that experienced programmers follow to make sure their code is clean and easy to read by others. This can feel overwhelming at first. It might seem like there are a million things you need to know before you even get started on your first coding project. However, trust us \\u2013 it\\u2019s not as scary as it may seem! Following coding best practices will not only help you get through future programming classes more easily but also prepare you for a career in software development.

That\\u2019s where Java packages come into play.\nA package in java is a collection of related classes, interfaces, enumerations, and sub-packages under one umbrella. As you may have already understood from the above explanation, packages are a great way to organize your code into logical units that can be reused across projects. Packages help you avoid naming conflicts with other libraries or programs and help keep related things together so they\\u2019re easier to find later on.
