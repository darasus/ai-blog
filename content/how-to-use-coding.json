From naming conventions to formatting standards, there are a ton of rules and best practices that experienced programmers follow to make sure their code is clean and easy to read by others. This can feel overwhelming at first. It might seem like there are a million things you need to know before you even get started on your first coding project. However, trust us \\u2013 it\\u2019s not as scary as it may seem! Following coding best practices will not only help you get through future programming classes more easily but also prepare you for a career in software development. In this blog post, we\\u2019ll explore some of the most important best practices for beginners who are learning to code.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
