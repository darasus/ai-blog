Each has its pros and cons when it comes to the various tasks involved in database management such as creating views and stored procedures, monitoring performance, creating indexes, and auditing user access privileges.\nDBAs should have broad knowledge of different database management systems (DBMS) so they can identify which one is most suitable for each scenario. In general, there are three main types of DBMSs: Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), Document-oriented Database Management Systems (DDMS), and Hybrid Database Management Systems (HDBMS).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don\\u2019t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
