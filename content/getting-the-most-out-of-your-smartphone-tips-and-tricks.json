The digital age has made it possible for people to work from virtually anywhere at any time. As a result, more people are leaving the office behind and working remotely or taking up independent contracting gigs, which is why we\\u2019re seeing so many young professionals ditch cubicles for coffee shops and other remote-friendly offices.\nWorking from home, going independent, or collaborating with coworkers online means millennials have given rise to what some have called \\u201Cthe gig economy.\\u201D It\\u2019s also prompted a shift in the types of companies people choose to work for and what skills they need to get hired in those roles \\u2014 regardless of where they do that work.

It won\\u2019t succeed. Not because of technical superiority of other operating systems, but because Microsoft has betrayed user trust.\nThe latest version of Windows betrays user privacy by default, as well as through aggressive telemetry data collection, browser tracking, and ad injection. Users who upgrade to Windows 10 can no longer trust their computer or the software that runs on it.\nWhen you use Windows 10, Microsoft collects personal information about you, your device usage habits, and apps that you install; all of which is transmitted back to the company in an unencrypted format.
