  "content": "## Use Battery-Saving Apps\n\nMost smartphone users aren’t aware that their devices have extensive power-saving settings built in. The first thing you should do is make sure you are familiar with your device’s battery-saving options. There are probably several battery-saving apps available in your app store, but you may want to consider the top-rated ones. You can also find some handy tips on how to reduce your phone’s battery consumption by turning off certain features that eat up power unnecessarily.\n\nYou can also tweak your device’s brightness settings to extend battery life. Keep in mind that brighter screens consume more power than dimmer ones, which means that you can extend your phone’s battery life by keeping the brightness on the lower end. You can also turn off certain features that eat up a lot of power, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, location services and screen brightness.\n\n## Lock Important Apps\n\nSmartphone owners frequently forget to lock their devices when they put them away. If you want to keep your phone safe, you should make sure all of your apps are locked when you aren’t using them. To lock apps on your device, follow these steps: Find the app in your phone’s settings, then toggle on “Lock.” Once you’ve locked the app, a lock icon will appear on the app’s icon. To unlock the app, just open your device’s settings and toggle off “Lock.”\n\nIf you’re worried about forgetting to lock an app, you can use an app such as AutoLocky to automatically lock all your apps when your device is idle. AutoLocky works on both Android and Apple devices.\n\n## Adjust Your Screen’s Brightness\n\nKeeping your screen brightness as low as possible will help extend the life of your device’s battery. You can also reduce the amount of blue light coming from your screen at night, which can interfere with your circadian rhythms and make it difficult to sleep. To lower the brightness on your device, open your settings and select “Brightness.” To adjust the blue light setting, navigate to “Display.”\n\nYou can also set your screen to automatically dim or change its brightness level based on the time of day. To do this, navigate to “Brightness” and toggle on “Automatic brightness” settings.\n\n## Organize Your Apps Using Folders\n\nIf you’ve amassed a ton of apps on your device, you may want to consider organizing them into folders. Folders make it easier to find apps and keep your device’s home screen tidy. To create a folder, open the app drawer and drag one app icon on top of another. To rename a folder, open the app drawer, tap the folder and select “Edit.”\n\nSome devices let you create multiple folders and even label them, which is useful if you want to create separate folders for work-related apps versus apps that you only use for fun. Some devices also let you change the order in which apps appear on your device’s home screen.\n\n## Back Up Photos Automatically\n\nIf you take a lot of photos on your device, you should keep them backed up to avoid losing them if you ever switch devices or lose your phone. To automatically backup photos on your device, follow these steps: Navigate to your device’s settings and select “Photos.” Next, select “Automatic upload” and select the backup service you’d like to use, such as Google Photos or iCloud. You can also set your device to automatically import any new photos that you take. To do this, navigate to your device’s settings and select “Photos.”\n\nIf you use the Google Photos app, you can set it to automatically add new photos to your library without having to manually import them. Just make sure that you’ve selected the “High-quality” option in your Google Photos settings.\n\n## Download Music And Videos For Offline Viewing\n\nIf you like to listen to music or watch videos on your device, you may want to consider downloading those files for offline viewing. This means that you’ll be able to listen to your music and watch your videos even if you don’t have an internet connection. To download music or videos from your device’s app store, select “Download” and choose “Download for offline use.”\n\nIf you have a subscription to streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, you may be able to download select shows and movies to your device. To do this, select “Download” and select “Download for offline use.”\n\n## Rotate Your Screen During Phone Calls\n\nIf you regularly conduct phone interviews or simply like to conduct phone conversations with the screen facing away from you, you may find it useful to rotate your screen during phone calls. This way, you can rest your phone against a table and face your screen away from you. To rotate your screen, open your device’s settings and select “Accessibility.” Next, toggle “Auto-rotate screen” on and select “Always.” You can also manually rotate your screen by double-tapping the “Rotate” button on the corner of your screen.\n\n## Turn On Smart Alerts For Apps You Use Most Often\n\nIf you struggle to stay on top of your calendar, consider turning on smart alerts for the apps you use most often. For example, if you use the Google Calendar app on your phone, you can set it to send you an alert when you have an upcoming meeting. To turn on smart alerts for your apps, navigate to your device’s settings and select each app to open its settings menu. Select “Notifications” and choose “Smart notifications” to turn on this feature for each app.\n\n## Summing up\n\nSmartphones can do a lot more than most people think. Those tiny devices packed with a dizzying array of features are also virtual Swiss Army knives, able to adapt to almost any situation. That’s because your phone is actually an “intelligent” device, as opposed to just being another way to check email or browse social media. Smartphones have the ability to learn and grow based on your usage habits, which means that if you know what you’re doing, your phone can do even more than you think.\n\nIn this post, we will share some tips and tricks that will help you get the most out of your smartphone. Keeping your phone charged, keeping your apps organized, keeping photos backed up, and many other helpful tricks can help you use your phone more efficiently."
