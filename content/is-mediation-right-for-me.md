summary: Mediation is a great way to resolve your disputes without going to
  court. Some disputes are too contentious or have too many conflicting
  interests for mediation to succeed. The role of the mediator is to help the
  parties come to an agreement that is fair and mutually beneficial. Mediation
  may be more burdensome on the parties than other dispute resolution
  mechanisms. If you have significant assets that will be impacted by a court
  decision, or if one of the parties is not interested in a mediated settlement,
  then mediation may not be the best option.
intro: Mediation is a great way for parties to resolve their disputes in an
  amicable environment. It is also a less expensive, private and confidential
  process that can help the parties reach an agreement quickly. While mediation
  works best when both parties are willing to negotiate and compromise, it does
  not always work out that way in real life. Some cases require the help of a
  neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement
  agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator
  will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they
  can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution
  process. So if you are involved in a dispute and want to avoid the stress,
  expense, and time consuming legal proceedings while keeping your relationship
  with your family members intact then mediation may be right for you

## Find Out If Mediation Is Right For Your Situation

Mediation is a great way to resolve your disputes without going to court. However, it is important to remember that not all disputes are appropriate for mediation. If you have significant assets that will be impacted by a court decision, or if one of the parties is not interested in a mediated settlement, then mediation may not be the best option.

In addition to these considerations, you must decide whether mediation is the right choice for your particular dispute. You must first decide whether settlement is an option in the dispute—while there are many cases that are appropriate for mediation, some disputes are too contentious or have too many conflicting interests for mediation to succeed.

## The Role Of Mediator

The role of the mediator is to help the parties come to an agreement that is fair and mutually beneficial. The mediator’s role is to facilitate communication and offer neutral guidance to help the parties find common ground.

The mediator does not take sides and does not make decisions for the parties. The parties make all the decisions. The mediator’s goal is to help the parties find a solution that is acceptable to both parties. The mediator does not have any authority to impose a solution on the parties.

## Benefits Of Mediation

Confidentiality - Mediation is a private process. The mediator will not disclose anything discussed in the mediation session.

Saves Time - A mediated settlement can be reached quicker than a court decision.

Cost Effective - Mediation is less expensive than going to court and will not accrue any legal fees.

No Unpleasant Surprises - Parties can control the outcome of their decision and do not have to worry about being surprised by a judge’s decision.

## Limitations of Mediation

Limited Jurisdiction - If one of the parties is not interested in a mediated settlement, then mediation may not be the best option.

Limited Authority - The mediator does not have any authority to impose a solution on the parties.

Burden on Parties - Mediation may be more burdensome on the parties than other dispute resolution mechanisms.
