summary: Dogs who are well-trained are less likely to be destructive or
  aggressive when they are bored or left home alone. Training can reduce your
  dog’s anxiety by giving them something productive to do, and it allows you to
  spend quality time with your dog. Having control over your dog will help them
  (and you) avoid unwanted confrontations with other people and their pets if
  your dog is not well-behaved. Training your dog can also help keep them
  mentally stimulated, which can help with boredom and depression.
intro: >-
  In this digital age, many dog owners are finding new and innovative ways
  to keep their dogs occupied. Occupational dog toys are designed to help keep
  your dog mentally stimulated so they don’t get bored and start chewing on your
  shoes or digging up the yard. But even with all of these fantastic
  innovations, most dogs will eventually get tired of playing with their toys
  and will look for something more interesting. This is where training comes in!

  To train your dog means to instruct them in some behavior that you want them to repeat consistently in different situations. Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like “sit” or “stay,” or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard. Whatever your level of experience, there are numerous benefits to training your dog.

## It Helps Build A Strong Bond

Dogs who are well-trained are less likely to be destructive or aggressive when they are bored or left home alone. Training can reduce your dog’s anxiety by giving them something productive to do, and it allows you to spend quality time with your dog. Having a well-trained dog can also help you feel more confident around other people and their pets, especially if you have a mixed breed who may not have been properly trained. There’s nothing better than the sound of confident, happy barking!

There are many different types of training available, and whichever one you choose, both you and your dog will benefit. Some dogs enjoy learning using treats and positive reinforcement, while others may prefer clicker training. Whatever works best for your dog, having them trained can help you feel more confident and connected to your dog.

## It’s Good for Your Dog’s Health

Some dogs who are overweight may be less likely to lose weight if they eat a strict diet. In order to lose weight, they must burn more calories than they take in, which is easier to do if they are active. Dogs who are obese are more likely to develop health issues like heart disease, joint problems, diabetes, and arthritis. Having your dog on a strict diet can be difficult and taxing for both of you if your dog is constantly begging for food or treats. Having your dog well-trained will give them something to do, which will make it easier for you if you decide to put your dog on a diet. Training your dog can also help keep them mentally stimulated, which can help with boredom and depression.

## It keeps your dog from jumping on Guests

One of the most easily avoidable behaviors many dogs do is jump up on people as they enter the house. This is often because they are excited to see their owner and don’t know when to stop. As a dog owner, you know that this is a sign of disrespect, and it’s something you should work to avoid. By training your dog to sit down by your side, it will be much easier to keep them seated and avoid this unwanted behavior. It’s important to start training this behavior as early as possible. With the right technique, even puppies can learn to sit by your side.

## It Helps You Have Control Over Your Dog

One of the biggest reasons to train your dog is so you have control over them in public. This will also help you avoid any confrontations with other people and their pets if your dog is not well-behaved. Having control over your dog will help them (and you) avoid unwanted confrontations. Do you ever wish you could make your dog stop barking when they are outside? You don’t want them to disturb the neighbors, but you can’t seem to get them to stop. Training your dog to respond to certain commands will help you avoid issues like this.

## Teaching your dog to stay or come when called is one of the most important things you can train.

One of the most important things you can train your dog to do is come when called. Unfortunately, this is one of the first things that many people forget to train when they get a new dog. This is a very important thing to train, both for your dog’s safety and your own. It is crucial that your dog comes back to you, even if they are chasing after a squirrel or another animal. If your dog doesn’t come back to you when called, they could get lost, hit by a car, or get into a fight with another animal.

## Tips For Training A Dog To Stay

The first thing to do is find a quiet place to train your dog. You want to be able to focus on your dog and not be distracted. Make sure there aren’t any distractions around, including other dogs or people. You might want to consider training your dog during their napping time if they like to sleep a lot. It’s also important to make sure that you are ready for the training. Make sure you have the proper mindset, and you are prepared for what comes next. It’s best to start this when your dog is young. This will make it easier for them to learn. Additionally, younger dogs have fewer distractions and fewer things to get in the way of their learning.

## Steps to Train a Dog to Stay

Start by standing still and holding a treat at your side. When your dog looks at the treat and tries to reach for it, say “stay” and move it just out of their reach. Repeat this a few times, and when your dog is starting to understand what you want, you can start moving around. Don’t move too far away, or your dog may lose focus. Keep this exercise relatively short, and don’t push your dog too hard. Remember that they are just learning a new skill, so this might take a while.

## More Advanced Techniques to Train a Dog to Stay and Come When Called

Try a Clicker Training Method: This involves clicking a small clicker (or a spoon, or even a hand click!) and giving your dog a treat as soon as they look at you, even if they don’t sit down. Once they are looking at you, you can ask them to sit again and give them another treat. This is a very effective way to train dogs, especially if you have a dog who is easily distracted. You can also use a method called tethering. With this method, you tether your dog to you with a short leash. When your dog tries to get up, they end up getting pulled back down by the leash. This method is a little controversial, so if you choose to use it, make sure you are careful not to overuse it.

## Bottom Line

Training your dog can be a lot of fun, and it can be very rewarding to see your dog learn new things and respond to commands. It’s important to remember that dogs don’t learn like humans do. They learn through repetition, and they need a lot of patience and care when being trained. It can take a while, but the end result will be worth it.
