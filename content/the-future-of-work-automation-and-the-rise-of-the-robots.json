It can also be used to create a feedback control system to regulate the temperature of a chemical reactor.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Robotics in manufacturing\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Robots are programmable machines that automate physical processes. These machines are often used to perform repetitive tasks in industries such as electronics, food and beverage, car manufacturing, and healthcare. For example, in a car manufacturing plant, robots would be responsible for removing engines from a conveyor belt and fitting the engine into a car. The use of robots in factories solves the problem of finding specialized labor that is needed to operate highly technical machinery. Robots can also be programmed to do tasks with greater precision and consistency than humans. The robots used in the manufacturing industry are generally classified into two categories: collaborative robots and automation robots. Collaborative robots are designed to work with humans and are suitable for light work environments. They are easy to program and operate, and can be programmed to conform to the movements of workers. Automation robots, on the other hand, are programmed to perform repetitive tasks on their own. They are ideal for environments where workers have to wear protective gear as they do not have the ability to adapt to the movements of humans.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Benefits of Automation and Robotics in Manufacturing\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Increased production and output: Automating production processes can increase overall output by at least 25%.
