intro: "In recent years, Apple has become known for its beautiful designs and
  attention to detail. This is particularly true of the company’s laptop
  offerings, like the MacBook Pro. These computers are sleek, powerful, and
  packed with features that make them stand out from their Windows-based
  competitors. But as great as these features may be on paper, not all Macbook
  Pros are created equal. Even if you get a high-end model with all of the bells
  and whisters that you want and need, it won’t last forever. Even the sturdiest
  of laptops will break down eventually. What’s important is how well equipped
  you are to handle these breakdowns when they happen. If your computer starts
  acting weird or giving you red flags about its performance, it’s probably time
  to take action sooner rather than later. Here are 3 reasons why your Macbook
  Pro may be lying to you:"

## The battery may be dying

The one component in a laptop that you can’t technically replace is the battery. This is because it’s actually integrated into the rest of the computer itself. And as such, it will have a finite lifespan. With regular use, your battery will start to degrade to the point where it’s no longer capable of holding a charge for very long at all. Once this happens, your computer will lose what is arguably its most useful feature: mobility. If your Macbook Pro’s battery has been in use for more than a couple of years without being properly maintained, it’s a sign that it’s reaching the end of its life cycle. It’s important to note that the condition of the rest of your laptop isn’t necessarily reflective of the battery itself. This is because the battery’s functionality is responsible for powering many of your laptop’s features. If the battery has degraded too much it could be preventing your computer from even booting up at all.

## Your hard drive is failing

It’s not uncommon for Macbook Pro hard drives to go bad. Perhaps you’ve been running an intensive workload for a long time, or you’ve been storing too many different types of files on your computer. Whatever the reason, a hard drive failure can have a devastating impact on your computer’s operation. Most of the time, you won’t even know that your hard drive has failed until it’s too late. You might notice that your computer is taking longer than normal to boot up. Or it may be running abnormally slow while you’re trying to perform everyday tasks. There are a few ways to tell if your hard drive is failing. One of the easiest ways is to hit Command+Shift+Period on your keyboard. If you’re prompted with a message indicating that there is a problem with your hard drive, you’re in trouble. If your Macbook Pro is giving you red flags about a hard drive problem, it’s best to have it looked at by a professional as soon as possible.

## MacOS has stopped supporting your model

Apple typically releases new laptops every year. While these new models are packed with new features and technologies, they’re also designed to be backwards compatible with older MacOS versions. This means that you can keep using your same computer for a few more years even after a new version of MacOS comes out. But, there are certain models that are no longer compatible with the latest MacOS. In these cases, your computer will give you a warning whenever you try to boot it up, explaining that it can’t do so because of a lack of support. This is a clear sign that your Macbook Pro has outlived its usefulness. If you see this message on your computer, it’s time to start shopping for a new laptop.

## Conclusion

When it comes to electronics, it’s better to be safe than sorry. And the sooner you can address the issues with your Macbook Pro, the better. Even if your computer is still working correctly, these issues could worsen and become even more costly down the line. Before you know it, you may find yourself in the market for a new laptop.

With so many great options available on the market, it can be difficult to know where to start. The best way to find a laptop that’s a good fit for your work and lifestyle is to first understand your current needs. Once you know what you’re looking for, you’ll be able to find a laptop that suits you perfectly.
