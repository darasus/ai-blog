Did you know that there are even studies that show getting less than five hours of sleep for two weeks straight can lead to hallucinations and other warning signs of declining mental health?\nThat might be a little bit scary for some people, but the truth is: You need to make sure you\\u2019re getting enough rest if you want to remain productive throughout your workday.
