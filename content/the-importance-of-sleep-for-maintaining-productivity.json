But it\\u2019s also meant that the role of work is changing faster than ever before. The future of work is changing fast too. As we enter into the digital age, there are new opportunities and challenges for jobs as we know them today. New jobs are being created, some old ones are disappearing, and many more will be influenced by technology in years to come. How will different industries adapt? What skills will be required in 10 years\\u2019 time? And what implications does this have for education today?\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
