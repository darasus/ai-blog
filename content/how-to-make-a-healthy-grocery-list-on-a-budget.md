  When it comes to eating healthy, the cost of good nutrition can shock
  even the most frugal shopper. Given that healthy food is generally more
  expensive than junk food, many people find it difficult to eat well on a
  budget. In fact, a recent study found that American families with incomes
  below $40,000 spend about 11 percent of their income on groceries. That’s
  almost double the amount spent by households that earn more than $80,000 a
  year.

  Fortunately, eating right doesn’t have to be an expensive proposition. With some planning and diligence, you can create cheap grocery lists on a regular basis and keep your household in peak nutritional condition while doing so. The first step is making smart shopping choices when you go to the store. Here are some tips to help you stock up on cheap groceries:

## Know Where To Shop

A big part of eating well on a budget is knowing where to shop for your groceries. Depending on your needs, it might make more sense to buy from a specialty store than from a big chain. Specialty stores often carry a greater variety of organic and health foods at lower prices than conventional grocery stores. Be aware that some of these stores charge a premium for the convenience of their products and services.

Specialty grocery stores include farmers’ markets, health food stores, and discount grocers such as Aldi and Save-A-Lot. Discount grocers often have great prices on healthy staples like whole grains, legumes, and produce. Health food stores, on the other hand, often carry higher-priced specialty items.

## Shop Only At Discount Grocery Stores

If you are serious about cutting costs without cutting corners when it comes to nutrition, then it might be a good idea to shop only at discount grocery stores. These retailers often sell produce, meat, and dairy products significantly below the prices of conventional stores. If you’re willing to do a little research, you can find a number of great stores in your area.
There are a few things to keep in mind when shopping at discount grocers. First, you’ll need to do some planning and come up with cheap grocery lists. Discount grocers typically don’t have the same selection as full-service grocery stores, so you’ll have to stick to the staples. Second, you’ll need to be careful with the fresh food you buy.

## Buy In-Season Produce

One of the easiest ways to reduce the cost of healthy eating is to buy produce in season. This will significantly reduce your grocery bill since out-of-season produce is usually expensive and may not be as nutritious.
You can track produce prices and availability online. Some produce databases even let you filter your results by location, letting you know which produce is in season in your area. For example, if you want to buy apples, you might see that they’re in season from September to March.
A word of advice: don’t assume that certain foods are always in season. For example, while tomatoes are in season during the summer months, they’re not typically in season in the winter.
If you have a garden, there’s no easier way to save money on food than by growing your own. You can grow many different types of produce, including tomatoes, strawberries, and herbs. Planting a garden takes time, but it’s a fun activity that can get you and your family outside.

## Don’t Be Afraid Of Frozen Foods

Some people shy away from frozen produce when they’re on a tight budget, but there’s no need to do so. Frozen produce can be very healthy, especially when it’s frozen soon after it’s harvested.
There are many advantages to buying frozen produce. For starters, frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh produce. Frozen fruits and vegetables are processed at their peak ripeness, which means they have more vitamins and minerals than their fresh counterparts. Plus, frozen produce comes with a long shelf life, so you can store it in your pantry. That can be helpful if you forget to go to the store.

There are a few things to keep in mind when buying frozen produce. First, not all frozen vegetables taste the same, so you’ll want to read product reviews before you buy. Second, not all frozen produce is created equal. Frozen vegetables tend to be lower in vitamins and minerals than frozen fruits.

## Know What You’ll Eat And What You Won’t

A good way to save money on healthy groceries is to buy foods you’re likely to eat. If you buy a ton of kale, but you don’t like kale, you’re just going to waste money. Before you plan your next shopping trip, think about the types of foods you like to eat.
Take into account anything that’s in season, and any special events that may call for certain foods. This can help you buy only the items you need and avoid buying a lot of items you don’t need or won’t eat.

## Conclusion

The best way to eat healthy on a budget is to not let cost be a factor. Instead, focus on nutrition and make healthy eating choices that fit your budget. Once you make healthy eating a priority, you’ll be surprised at how many low-cost options you have available to you.

For example, beans are extremely nutritious and cost less than $1 per pound. Nuts, seeds, and whole grains are also very healthy and inexpensive. These foods make healthy eating easy on any budget.
