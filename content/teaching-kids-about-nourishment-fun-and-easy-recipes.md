## Teaching kids about nutrition with food games

One fun way to teach your kids about the different types of nutrients in food is to use a food game. One example is to play a game of "go fish" with different foods. You can choose foods that have certain benefits, such as foods rich in iron for growing kids, or foods that are high in protein for active kids. You can also play a game with cards that have pictures of different types of nutrients on them, such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Another fun game to play is "edu-quiz", where you test your child on what they’ve learned about different foods and nutrients. You can also challenge your child to come up with their own questions about healthy eating, and see if they know the answers.

## Cookie dough bites

Next up, we have a recipe for cookie dough bites. While it’s probably not good to eat this all the time, kids will love the idea of making cookie dough without actually baking anything. This is a great recipe for kids who are interested in cooking, and want to try out new things in the kitchen. This is also a great recipe for kids who are curious about baking, but may not be old enough to actually do it yet.
These bites are made with vanilla wafers and peanut butter, and you can switch up the flavour by using different types of cookies. The best part about this recipe, is that you can make them as big or as small as you want, so they’re perfect for kids of all ages.

This means that you’re getting a ton of different nutrients and vitamins out of one smoothie.
This recipe also doesn’t require any cooking, and you can use frozen fruit to make it even easier to make. The best part is that you can change up the recipe based on the ages of your kids, and add more or less of each fruit based on what they like best.
