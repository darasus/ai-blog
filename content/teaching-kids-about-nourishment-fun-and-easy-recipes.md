summary: Kids need to be exposed to vegetables as early as possible, but if
  you’re doing this at the wrong time or in the wrong way, it can actually make
  things worse. Whole grains contain more fiber than refined grains, and they
  also contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Healthy fats are an
  important part of a balanced diet, but it can be easy for kids to overlook
  them because they don’t come in the form of a tasty treat or snack. You should
  start feeding your baby vegetables sometime between the ages of 6 and 9
  months.

## Don’t be afraid of vegetables!

Vegetables don’t have to be boring! With the right recipes, your kids will be requesting broccoli and cauliflower just as much as they do macaroni and cheese. Put vegetables on the kids’ menu once a week, and have them try a new recipe every time. For example, you could try baked zucchini, broccoli with cheese sauce, spinach with apples, and homemade coleslaw. Switch up the ingredients and the recipes all the time to keep things interesting and make vegetables a source of fun rather than a source of boredom.

If your child doesn’t like vegetables, you’ll need to make a few adjustments before you introduce them. Kids need to be exposed to vegetables as early as possible, but if you’re doing this at the wrong time or in the wrong way, it can actually make things worse. At the same time, you don’t want to wait too long or your child will never develop a taste for vegetables. In general, you should start feeding your baby vegetables sometime between the ages of 6 and 9 months (or as soon as you notice him/her showing interest in food).

## Get the whole grains

Whole grains contain more fiber than refined grains, and they also contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Including a couple servings of whole grains in your child’s diet is an easy way to get more nutrition into their diet without them even realizing it. You can use whole grains to make a variety of different foods, including baked goods, casseroles, and even side dishes.

One easy way to get your child to eat more whole grains is to swap out white pasta for whole wheat pasta. Your child may not even notice the difference. You can also use whole wheat flour to make cookies and cakes, and you can serve whole grain rice or corn with meals. You can even use whole wheat pita pockets for sandwiches or pitas for tacos.

## Healthy fats are important too

Healthy fats, such as the fats found in lean meats, nuts, seeds, and avocados, are an essential part of a healthy diet. They are important for growth and development, and they help the body in many different ways. Healthy fats are an important part of any balanced diet, but it can be easy for kids to overlook them because they don’t come in the form of a tasty treat or snack.

While you may not be able to get your kids to eat healthy fats in large amounts, you can add them to foods that your kids already love. For example, try mixing nuts into baked goods or topping tacos with avocado or guacamole. Another option is to use healthier fats to replace unhealthy fats in your child’s favorite recipes. For example, use olive oil instead of butter when you’re sautéing vegetables, or use low-fat dairy instead of whole milk or heavy cream in baked goods.

## Play with protein

Getting enough protein is important for growing kids, but it can be difficult to get enough in the diet. If your child is vegetarian, this can be especially tricky. One easy way to get protein into your child’s diet is to add beans to your diet. Kidney, black, and pinto beans are full of protein and are easy to add to any meal, especially chili and tacos.

If your child is not a fan of beans, try loaves made with beans or lentils instead. You can also find protein-rich alternatives to your child’s favorite treats and snacks. For example, you could make protein bars or protein-packed muffins, add nuts and seeds to your child’s favorite trail mix, or top your child’s yogurt with nuts, seeds, or dried fruit.

## Stay away from junk food

Junk food does not have any nutritional value, which means that it has nothing for your child’s body. As a matter of fact, most junk foods are filled with preservatives and other chemicals that are very harmful to your child’s body. This type of food makes it even harder for your child to grow and stay healthy, so it’s important that you keep your child away from it as much as you can.

If your child is old enough, you can have a real talk about the negative impact of junk food. If your child is a little too young for a serious talk, you can use more humorous and silly methods. You can also use positive reinforcement to help keep your child away from junk food. For example, you can let your child pick out their favorite toy or gift at the end of each week if they eat healthy all week long.

## Conclusion

Kids are picky eaters by nature, and they can be reluctant to try new foods. That doesn’t mean that you can’t help your child learn about the benefits of healthy foods. In fact, even the littlest of kids are capable of grasping basic concepts about nutrition and how certain types of food make them feel.

Whether or not your child is a picky eater, these nutrition tips will help them understand why it’s important to eat fruits, veggies, whole grains and other wholesome foods. You can also use these tips to come up with fun recipes they won’t soon forget.
