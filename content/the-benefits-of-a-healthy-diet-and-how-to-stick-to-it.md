## Change Your Environment

You don’t have to become a hermit, but you might want to reconsider your dining options. Eating out is often a bad idea for those on a healthy diet, since it gives you very little control over your food choices. However, if you must eat out, try eating at places that offer healthier options.
Most restaurants now offer healthier menu items and can cater to a wide range of dietary needs, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and low-sugar options. It may take a little research, but you can often find healthier options on menus.
Try packing your lunch when you can, or eating at a friend’s house rather than going out. These changes to your routine can help you avoid unhealthy snacking and dining choices.

## Plan Ahead

It’s easier than you might think to have a healthy day. Simply plan ahead and try to avoid being caught off guard by hunger or cravings.
Plan your meals and snacks in advance, and they will come easily. This helps you not only stay away from unhealthy options, but it also helps you get a healthy amount of each food group in your diet. It can also be helpful to keep a food journal so you can track what you’re eating daily.
A healthy meal plan is the best way to prevent the pitfalls of unhealthy eating. By planning what you’ll eat, you’ll avoid eating too little or too much; you’ll make sure you’re eating the right foods; and you’ll avoid wasting money on unneeded food. Meal planning is a simple way to make sure you get everything you need from your diet.

## Track What You’re Eating

If you’re really serious about staying on track with your diet, keep a food journal. Food journals are often used as a way to track and modify diet patterns, and can be very effective at helping people lose weight. A food journal can be as simple as writing down what you ate every day. Or, it can be more complex and involve calculating the calories, vitamins, and minerals of each meal.
A research study found that people who consistently track their food intake lose more weight than those who don’t. This is likely because people who consistently track their food intake are more mindful of what they’re eating.
When you’re diligent about writing down everything you eat, you’ll likely make better choices. You’ll be more aware of how much of each food group you’re getting, and you’ll be less likely to overeat.

## Eat Plenty of Protein

Most diets will include some amount of protein, and for good reason. While protein is present in all foods, high-protein foods include meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products.
While protein is essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of your muscles, it also has many other health benefits. Protein can help you lose weight, prevent disease, improve your mood, and even extend your life.
In fact, diets that contain a high amount of protein have been shown to lead to significantly more weight loss than diets that are lower in protein.
With so many benefits, it’s no wonder protein is a staple of many healthy diets.

## Eat Lots of Vegetables

Vegetables are packed with nutrients and vitamins that keep your body strong and healthy. Eating a healthy amount of vegetables every day can help prevent many diseases, including heart disease and cancer.
Vegetables are also low in calories and high in fiber, which can help you feel full and maintain a healthy weight.
It’s recommended that adults eat five servings of vegetables per day. However, some people, such as those who are pregnant, need even more.
You don’t need to eat vegetables plain and alone. There are plenty of ways to get your daily vegetables. Soups, casseroles, salads, and stir-fries are just a few examples.

## Don’t Forget the Fruits

Fruits can be just as healthy as vegetables, but many people neglect their daily servings of fruit. While fruits are generally higher in sugar than vegetables, they can still be an important part of a healthy diet if eaten in moderation.
Fruits contain many essential vitamins and minerals and can be very helpful in your weight loss journey if eaten in moderation.
They also contain lots of fiber and can help you feel full.
Many people are surprised to learn that a healthy diet may include some fruit, but it’s true. If you aren’t sure how much fruit to eat, consult your doctor to determine your specific needs.

## Don’t Forget the Whole Grains

Whole grains are packed with vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and B vitamins, which are essential to a healthy diet.
They are also high in fiber and protein, which can help you feel full and maintain a healthy weight.

Whole grains are any grain whose bran (outer layer) and germ (inner part) are intact. This includes wheat, rice, oats, corn, barley, and rye. Whole grains are significantly more nutritious than refined grains, which have had their bran and germ removed.
There are many benefits associated with eating whole grains, including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Unfortunately, many people in the United States don’t eat enough whole grains.

## Bottom Line

A healthy diet is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. Eating well can help you lose weight, stay healthy, and enjoy life more. A healthy diet can also help prevent disease and extend your life.
Try changing your environment, planning ahead, and keeping track of what you eat. Focus on eating plenty of protein, vegetables, and whole grains. Don’t forget the fruits, and don’t forget the whole grains. With these tips and a little effort, you can easily start eating a healthy diet.
