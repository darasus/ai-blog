  "summary": "The blockchain is a digital distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and decentralized manner. Because the blockchain is distributed across thousands of computers, it is extremely difficult to hack. The data can also be traced to its origins. It is poised to be a game changer especially in product supply chains where provenance and authenticity are critical. It can be used to design and deploy financial products, such as investing, lending, insurance, and savings, in a peer-to-peer manner. Small businesses can therefore cut down on the costs and fees associated with financial transactions and cross-border payments.",
