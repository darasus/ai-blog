  "content": "## What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that was first outlined in a white paper published in 2008 and began being traded as an investment option in September 2017. It’s the first example of a cryptocurrency, an asset that can be easily transferred between users (or \"adapters\") and also has a fixed supply. This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.\n\nThe creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\n\n## How do you buy Bitcoin?\n\nThere are a number of ways you can buy Bitcoin. You can purchase them on an exchange using your desired currency or you can use a broker like Coinbase to purchase them using a credit card.\n\nOnce you’ve purchased Bitcoin, you can store them on an exchange or in a wallet.

You can sell them back to exchanges that allow you to exchange your Bitcoin for your desired currency or you can sell them to a broker like Coinbase.\n\nFinally, it’s important to note that Bitcoin and altcoin prices can be extremely volatile. This means that the price of your holdings can fluctuate significantly from day to day, so it’s important to make sure you’re willing to take on this level of risk before investing.\n\n## Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform developed in 2014 by the company behind Bitcoin, with the goal of reducing some of the restrictions associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain. The Ethereum network supports a variety of decentralized applications, including decentralized autonomous organizations and various types of smart contracts.\n\nThe Ethereum network has a token called Ether that is used as payment for network fees and also as a method of voting on and activating new decentralized applications.

There are also a number of Ethereum funds that are available to investors.\n\n## Ripple\n\nRipple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed in 2012 that uses blockchain technology. It’s designed to offer a fast and inexpensive method of transferring funds between financial institutions. The current market cap of Ripple is $36.3 billion.\n\nThe Ripple network allows for the transfer of various different types of assets and can also be used for real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.
