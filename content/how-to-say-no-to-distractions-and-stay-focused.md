summary: Have a clear plan for how you want to spend your time and what you need
  to do to stay focused. Turn off notifications from apps on your phone or
  computer, messages from social media, and even alerts from software you use
  for work can all be a source of constant distraction if you don’t turn them
  off. If you find yourself getting distracted by certain websites or apps on a
  regular basis, you might want to consider blocking them. Use music or audio
  books to help you stay focused on what you’re doing and prevent yourself
  getting caught up in other distractions.
intro: >-
  Everyone who’s ever had more than one task to complete at the same time
  knows how hard it can be to stay focused and get things done. 

  Everyone has their own methods for keeping distractions at bay, but staying focused often requires a constant battle with your own impulses. 

  In an increasingly connected world, it can be almost impossible to avoid distraction. Even so, most people also have a much harder time keeping themselves from getting caught up in everything that tempts them away from their primary objectives.

  There are many ways you can keep yourself on track and maintain concentration even when there are so many distractions coming at you from all angles. The trick is in knowing what they are and where they tend to come from — and then arranging your environment accordingly to prevent them before they have a chance to catch you unawares.

## Have A Plan

Before you even start tackling your daily objectives, you need to have a clear idea of what they are. This means knowing not just what tasks you have to complete, but also why you have to complete them.
If you don’t have a clear plan for how you want to spend your time, you will struggle to stay focused on anything because you won’t know what to prioritize above anything else.
Without a plan, the challenge of staying focused becomes about resisting whatever urges to distraction are strongest at any given time. Even if you do manage to resist the distractions that come at you, though, you won’t have a clear plan for how to use your time productively.

## Outline What You Need To Get Done

One of the best ways to stay on track when you’re trying to avoid distractions is to go over what you have to get done and what you need to do to get there.
This can help you get a clear picture of your objectives and see if you’re focusing on the right things in the right way. If you find yourself drifting away from your main goals or getting distracted by side projects that aren’t important enough to divert your attention, you can redirect your focus accordingly.
This approach also helps you set realistic expectations for yourself. If you know what has to be done and what you need to do it, you’ll be able to prioritize tasks more effectively and avoid getting overwhelmed by everything you need to do.

## Turn Off Notifications

One of the biggest sources of distraction in modern life is notifications — even if you don’t actually end up looking at or reading the content of the notifications you receive.
Notifications from apps on your phone or computer, messages from social media, and even alerts from software you use for work can all be a source of constant distraction if you don’t turn them off.
If you don’t turn off notifications, you’ll constantly feel the urge to check for messages, alerts, and updates — even if you know none of them are important. Instead of being able to stay focused on what you’re doing, you’ll be constantly pulled out of your own headspace by urges to look at your device or click on whatever app icon just lit up.
Not only that, but even when you do check your notifications, you’ll often be interrupted and pulled out of what you’re doing. 
You might want to look at the content of a message, or you might want to respond right away. In either case, though, you’ll be pulled out of the task you’re trying to complete.

## Block Websites And Apps

If you find yourself getting distracted by certain websites or apps on a regular basis, you might want to consider blocking them. This can help you stay focused on whatever you’re trying to do and resist the temptation to open the app or visit the site just because you can.
If you have a lot of social media accounts, you might consider blocking them all. Even if you only block certain sites, though, you can still use your browser to prevent yourself from opening certain pages.
If you have work-related tasks you have to complete, you also might want to block certain sites that can be a source of constant distraction.
If you’re writing a report, for example, you might not want to be able to access social media or your email account just in case you get distracted by something there and want to respond to it.

## Use Music Or Audio Books

If you find yourself getting distracted by sounds or other things going on in your environment, you might want to consider using music or audio books to block them out. This can help you stay focused on what you’re doing and prevent yourself from getting caught up in whatever else is going on around you.
When you’re trying to stay focused, you want to make sure everything around you that could potentially distract you has been removed or has been reduced to the point where it can’t break your concentration.
When you’re in a noisy coffee shop and trying to get work done, for example, you might want to put on a pair of headphones and listen to a book or a music playlist on your phone to block out the sounds of people talking and other distractions.

## Take Short Breaks

Finally, you should know that you don’t have to fight against distraction continuously. In fact, you can actually use distraction to your advantage.
When you’re working on a challenging task, you might want to take breaks now and again to help you stay focused on the task and prevent yourself from burning out.
Distraction isn’t always a bad thing. If you know that you’re more effective when you’re taking short breaks, you might want to set a timer and take breaks every so often just to give your brain a bit of a break.
Taking breaks can actually help you stay more focused overall by giving your brain a chance to recharge and come back to your work with a fresh perspective.
Too many breaks, though, can actually have the opposite effect and make you less effective. If you’re taking frequent breaks, you should make sure they’re short so you don’t lose momentum.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, there is no real way to completely eliminate distractions. You can only do your best to minimize distractions and make yourself productive. There are actually a lot of ways to combat distractions if you know how to manage your time wisely. The best way to achieve a distraction-free environment is to stay organized, create a to-do list, and prioritize your tasks based on their importance. And if you do find yourself being distracted, just remember that it's not the end of the world. You can always start fresh whenever you're ready!
