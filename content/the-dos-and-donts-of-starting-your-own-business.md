summary: Starting your own business is a big decision, and not one you should
  make on a whim. Don’t try to do everything yourself - instead, be organized
  and delegating as much as you can to other people. Plan out your expenses as
  thoroughly as possible, and be sure to hire part-time employees to help you
  out. Dictating your business plan will also help you understand what you're
  getting yourself into and how much money you're going to need in the short and
  long term.
intro: >-
  Starting your own business can be an incredibly exciting prospect. In
  theory, running your own company appears to offer you a great deal of freedom
  and flexibility - allowing you to tailor your working hours around childcare
  or other obligations, while also giving you the opportunity to develop a brand
  new career path.

  Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different. As with any job, starting your own business involves a significant amount of hard work and dedication. It isn’t easy, and many prospective entrepreneurs give up before they even begin. However, with the right guidance and support network in place, it also doesn’t need to be as difficult as most people imagine. To that end, if you’re currently exploring the idea of starting your own business - either as a sole proprietor or as part of an organisation - we have some handy advice on what not to do:

## Don’t try to do everything yourself

Starting your own business isn’t a quick and easy way to make a quick buck. It’s a lot of hard work, and a lot of sacrifice. This is especially true when you’re just starting out, and you need to do everything within your powers to get your company off the ground.
Don’t try to do everything yourself - instead, be organized and delegating as much as you can to other people. This might be by hiring some part-time employees to help you out, or outsourcing various tasks to freelancers or remote workers. Alternatively, you might prefer to join forces with other like-minded individuals - be it to create a joint business venture, or simply to exchange skills and experience with like-minded individuals.

## Don’t quit your job without a plan

Starting your own business is a big decision, and not one you should make on a whim. Before you quit your job and dive headfirst into starting your own company, you need to have a clear business plan in place.
With your business plan, you can not only help potential investors gain a better understanding of your company and the products or services it offers, but also help yourself to understand what you’re getting yourself into. It will also give you a clearer idea of the amount of time and effort you’ll need to invest in order to make your business a success.
Don’t quit your job without a plan, and don’t quit your job without a fallback plan either. If you’re going to quit your day job to focus on your own company full time, you need to be able to support yourself financially until your business is generating enough profit to become sustainable.

## Don’t spend too much too quickly

Starting a business is expensive, but that doesn’t mean you should spend all of the money in your bank account on start-up costs. When you’re first starting out, you’re going to have to invest a significant amount of money in order to set-up your business. However, that doesn’t mean you should spend all of your savings on doing so.
Don’t spend too much too quickly, and be sure to plan out your expenses as thoroughly as possible. Not only will this help you to avoid making costly mistakes, but it will also give you a clearer idea of how much money you’re going to need in the short and long term.

## Don’t underestimate the amount of work involved

Starting a business is hard work - it isn’t something that you can do in your spare time on the side, and it isn’t something you can do on the weekends. You need to dedicate yourself to your business 100%, as well as find ways of making your business as sustainable as possible.
Don’t underestimate the amount of work involved, and don’t treat your business as a part-time hobby. Instead, try to find ways of making your company as profitable as possible, while also finding ways of making your working hours as efficient as possible. This might involve learning basic time management skills, or setting strict targets for how much work you’re going to get done each day. Whatever the case, you need to be as efficient as possible - both for your sake, and for the sake of your business.
Don’t treat your new start-up as a hobby or something you can do on the side. Instead, dedicate all of your waking hours to making your business successful.

## Bottom line

Starting your own business is incredibly challenging, and it isn’t something that all people are cut out for. With that in mind, don’t rush into starting your own company - instead, make sure that you fully understand what is involved, and that you’re ready for everything that comes with it.
Don’t try to do everything yourself, don’t quit your job without a plan, don’t spend too much too quickly, and don’t underestimate the amount of work involved. With those points in mind, you’re well on your way to starting a successful business venture.
