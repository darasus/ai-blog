  "summary": "You donâ€™t need to spend hours training your dog, but you do need to be consistent. Start by picking one area of your garden and telling your dog to toilet there on a regular basis. Reward your dog with praise or playtime if they do their business there. If your dog has an accident inside, you need to ignore it and act as if it didn't happen. Spray vinegar or bitter spray around the garden to discourage your dog from using it. This is the best way to train a dog and it is something that should continue to do throughout their life.",
