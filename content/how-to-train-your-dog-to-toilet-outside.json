It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.

You pay for it either directly by paying the mediator or indirectly by paying the lawyers. But how much does mediation cost?\nMediation costs will vary depending on where you live, the nature of your dispute, and the reputation of the mediator or firm you choose to take on your case.\nWhile some attorneys may offer their clients a choice between litigation and a certain number of hours of mediation at a reduced rate as an alternative to litigation, most attorneys charge their standard rates for mediation services.\nThe hourly rate for a private mediator may range from $100 per hour to $300 per hour or more; however, most mediators will have standard market rates that fall within that range. Many corporations and nonprofit organizations negotiate group discounts when contracting with third-party mediation services. In general, expect to spend $200 to $500 per party for a one-day mediation session with two neutral mediators and an independent arbiter.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
