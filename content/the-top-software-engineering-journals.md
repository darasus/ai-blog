summary: There are many software engineering conferences all over the world,
  many of which are free to attend. Conferences are a great way to network with
  other software engineers in your field, as well as find out about interesting
  research. Each conference publishes papers related to a specific topic within
  software engineering. If you want to be a successful software engineer, you
  need to keep up with what’s going on on what is published in journals related
  to your field. All of the recommendations below are available for free to read
  for anyone.
intro: >-
  Software engineers constantly have to stay up-to-date with new research,
  trends, and techniques in their field. The most common way for software
  engineers to do this is by reading research papers published in journals.
  These journals are almost exclusively found online. Many of them are available
  for free, but some are behind paywalls for non-subscribers. Fortunately, you
  don’t need to subscribe to every single one of these journals if you’re a
  software engineer—just the ones that publish articles related to your specific
  interests and career goals as a software engineer. 

  Read on to learn more about the top software engineering journals so that you can pick which ones will help you excel as a software engineer!

## Editor’s note: At the time of writing this, all of the recommendations below are free to read for anyone. However, it’s worth noting that some of these publications do have paid subscriptions with additional benefits like access to their vast digital libraries and automatic downloads of articles for reading off-line. If you want to read more about software engineering journals in general, check out the “Why You Should Read Scientific Journals” section at the end of this article. END editor's note>

## Software Engineering Conferences

As you can see from the list of journals, conferences are probably a better way to go than journals for keeping up to date with the latest research in your field. Conferences are much more timely than journals, since they publish the papers delivered at their events fairly soon after the conferences conclude.

There are many software engineering conferences all over the world, many of which are free to attend. Conferences are a great way to network with other software engineers in your field, as well as find out about interesting research going on in your field. You can also present your own research at conferences if you have any worth publishing!

## IFIP International Conference on Software Engineering

The IFIP Conference is held every two years in a different location all over the world. The conference has been published in a journal since its inception in 1970, with the first volume of the journal published in 1971. The journal is published by Springer, which means that it is accessible to most people online. The editors of the journal accept papers in a variety of topics related to software engineering, including business aspects of software engineering, formal methods, and requirements engineering.

## IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering

Unlike the IFIP conference, the IEEE conference is held annually. The conference has been published in a journal since the late 1980s. The journal is published by the IEEE Computer Society, which means that the journal is only accessible to subscribers to the society. The IEEE conference publishes papers on a variety of topics related to software engineering, with a special focus on systems engineering and software product engineering.

## ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Engineering Practices

The ACM SIGSOFT conference publishes papers every other year that focus on research in software engineering practices. The conference has been published in a journal since 2006, and is published by ACM. The journal is accessible to some people online, but the vast majority of readers must be subscribers to the journal. The journal publishes papers on a variety of topics related to software engineering practices.

## IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security

The IEEE conference publishes papers every two years on a variety of topics related to software quality, reliability, and security. The conference has been published in a journal since 1992, and is published by IEEE. The journal is accessible to most people online. The journal publishes papers on a variety of topics related to software quality, reliability, and security.

## IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)

The IEEE conference publishes papers every two years on a variety of topics related to computer software and applications. The conference has been published in a journal since its inception in 1960, and is published by IEEE. The journal is accessible to most people online, but it is behind a paywall. The journal publishes papers on a variety of topics related to computer software and applications.

## IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Secure and Trustworthy Computing

The IEEE conference publishes papers every two years on a variety of topics related to dependability, security, and trust in computing systems. The conference has been published in a journal since 1993, and is published by IEEE. The journal is accessible to most people online. The journal publishes papers on a variety of topics related to dependability, security, and trust in computing systems.

## IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security

The IEEE conference publishes papers every two years on a variety of topics related to software quality, reliability, and security. The conference has been published in a journal since 1992, and is published by IEEE. The journal is accessible to most people online. The journal publishes papers on a variety of topics related to software quality, reliability, and security.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are many software engineering journals out there. Each publishes papers related to a specific topic within software engineering. If you want to be a successful software engineer, you need to keep up with what’s going on in your field. One of the best ways to do that is to read articles published in journals related to software engineering.
