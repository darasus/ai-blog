## What is SEO?

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving your website’s ranking so it appears higher in organic search engine results. SEO is made up of four factors: technical SEO, content SEO, backlinks, and social media. Technical SEO refers to making sure your website is optimized for search engines. For example, you may want to include your keyword in your page title, add alt text to images, and use your preferred font.

Content SEO includes creating and publishing high-quality content on your website such as blog posts and articles. To rank higher in search engines, these pieces of content should be optimized for certain keywords and be between 80-500 words in length. Backlinks are hyperlinks that take people from one website to another. Some examples of backlinks include: linking to other websites, creating a blog, or writing a press release. Finally, social media can help you grow your brand and gain new followers. It’s important to note that not all social media platforms are created equal. For example, images and videos rank higher than just copy on Facebook.

## Why is SEO important for businesses?

First, we should understand the benefits of SEO, and why it’s essential for businesses to have a strong online presence. SEO brings in more leads and sales. This means that people will find your website through search engines, which will result in them clicking on your website and purchasing your products or services. More traffic to your website. As mentioned before, people will find your website through search engines.
For example, if you have a bakery and you want to sell sourdough bread, you can create a blog post about sourdough starter. You can use keywords such as “sourdough starter” or “sourdough recipe.” This way, people will find your website through Google and click on the article to read it. This will result in more traffic to your website.

## Start with a plan

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of SEO, you need to make sure that you have a solid plan in place. First, decide on your website’s purpose. What do you want people to take away from your site? Do you want your site to be informational? Or, do you want to drive people to a sales process?
Once you’ve decided on your site’s purpose, make sure that you’re speaking to the right audience. If your goal is to create an informational website, try to avoid using jargon or words that are too technical. The best way to do this is by conducting some research on who your target audience is. You can also try surveying your friends and family to see what words they use when searching for information.

## Producing high-quality content

Next, we’ll discuss how to create high-quality content for your website. First, you have to understand what makes a piece of content high-quality. This content must have a clear message, be engaging, and be easy to read.
For example, if you own a bakery, creating a recipe article is a great way to create high-quality content. You can also create an article about the health benefits of eating sourdough bread.

Remember, you want to create content that is useful and relatable. Once you’ve determined what type of content you’d like to create, write down three topics that you would like to cover. Next, choose one topic and write a short paragraph about it. Try to use your keyword at least once per paragraph. This will help you keep track of your keyword so that you don’t overuse it.

## Keyword research

Next, we will discuss keyword research. This is an essential part of creating high-quality content for your website. Keyword research is when you find the terms people are searching for online, and then create content around those terms.
Some ways you can find these keywords are by using tools such as Google’s Keyword Planner or a keyword research tool such as Keyworddit.

You can also use Google Trends to find out what people are currently searching for. The best time to do research is in the beginning stages of your website. This way, you have time to create content around your findings.

## Imported Content and Authored Content

Next, we will discuss imported content and authored content. Imported content is when you take an article or content from another website and repost it on your own website. This is a quick way to create content, but it’s not recommended because search engines don’t like it. They will see that you copied the content and may penalize your website.

Authored Content is when you create unique content just for your website. This means that you are not copying any content from other websites and you are citing your sources. For example, if you are writing a recipe article, you should use your own ingredients and your own instructions for making the recipe.
