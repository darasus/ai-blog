Sourdough starter is a fermented dough used to make sourdough bread. It is made from a combination of flour and water and contains natural yeast and bacteria.

To make your own sourdough starter, mix equal parts flour and water in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and set it in a warm, draft-free place. Allow the mixture to ferment for 24-48 hours.

After 24-48 hours, the mixture should be bubbly and have a sour smell. At this point, you can use it to make sourdough bread or store it in the refrigerator for future use.

To store your sourdough starter, mix equal parts flour and water in a jar. Cover the jar tightly and store it in the refrigerator. The starter will keep for several weeks.

When you are ready to use your sourdough starter, remove it from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature. Then, mix it with an equal amount of flour and water. Allow the mixture to ferment for another 24-48 hours before using it to make sourdough bread.
