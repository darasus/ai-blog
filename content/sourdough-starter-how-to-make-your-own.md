## What you’ll need

For those of you who want to get started straight away, we recommend buying a starter kit that includes everything you’ll need to create your own healthy sourdough starter. Starter kits come with a glass jar and rubber seal, a measuring spoon and a fermentation guide to walk you through the process of creating a healthy and active sourdough starter. The starter kits are really easy to use, and make creating your very own sourdough starter a breeze. If you’d prefer to make your starter from scratch, you’ll need to purchase some sourdough starter powder or a live sourdough culture.

You can buy sourdough starter powders from baking supply stores and online. They will come with instructions on how to use them to make your starter. Alternatively, you can purchase a live sourdough culture online, which is a pea-sized piece of a mother sourdough starter. The mother will come in its own jar with a little bit of flour and water, ready for you to feed and grow.

## How to make sourdough starter

The process for making sourdough starter is very similar to the method for creating a yeast-based starter. You’ll need a large jar – we recommend a 2-litre glass jar, and a wooden spoon or potato masher. You can use any type of jar, but try to make sure it’s large enough so that the starter doesn’t spill over as it expands. Make sure it is clean and dry, and that you sterilise it before you make your starter (see below for instructions).
First, add half a cup of organic wholemeal flour and half a cup of water to your jar. Mix the contents of the jar together completely. Then, cover the jar with a tea towel and leave it somewhere warm – but not too hot – for 24 hours.
Next, add another half a cup of flour and half a cup of water to your starter, replacing the tea towel and leaving it in the same warm spot.
Repeat this process every day until the starter has doubled in size and it is bubbling away (this will take around 5 days).
You can now use your starter to make sourdough bread, or keep feeding it and growing it until it is ready to be used as a mother starter.

## Store your sourdough starter

The easiest way to store your sourdough starter is in the jar you made it in. If you don’t have the space for a 2-litre jar, you can transfer it to a smaller jar. Once it is fully mature, cover it with a tea towel, seal the jar with a lid or put it in a plastic bag, and store it on the fridge. Sourdough starter can be kept up to a few months, as long as it is fed regularly and kept out of direct sunlight.

If you have too much starter to fit in one jar, you can pour it into smaller mason jars, seal them and keep them in the fridge. When you want to use your starter again, take it out of the fridge and leave it on the counter for a few hours so it is nice and warm when you use it.

## How to use your sourdough starter

If you have been feeding your starter and growing it until it is ready to be used as a mother starter, you’re now ready to use it to make sourdough bread. If you have a ready-made starter, skip to the next section.

To use a ready-made starter, you will need to ‘feed’ it regularly so that it remains active and healthy. If you have a live starter, keep feeding it with fresh flour and water as you did when you created it. Transfer a small amount of starter from the jar into a bowl and replace the jar with fresh flour and water. Feed the jar with starter every day until it has doubled in size again.

## Tips for making and storing a sourdough starter

- Make sure your starter has the correct level of acidity – You can test the pH level of your starter using a pH strip. Sourdough should be between a pH level of 4.6 and 5.6. If your starter is too acidic, you can add more flour to balance it out. If it is too alkaline, you’ll need to add more water.
- Make sure your starter gets enough food and water – Feed your starter twice a day to keep it growing and healthy, and store it in a warm place.
- Use the best quality ingredients you can – Sourdough starter is alive and active, so it needs the best possible food to grow. Use organic, wholemeal flour and filtered water when feeding your starter.
