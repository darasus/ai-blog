summary: "Alan Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist who broke the
  Enigma code. He was convicted of \"gross indecency\" for being gay and
  chemically castrated as punishment. Turing created the first “artificial
  intelligence” machine: a computer that could simulate a person’s intelligence.

intro: >-
  In 1937, Alan Turing was born in Northern England. He would go on to
  become a war hero, pioneer of computer science, and one of the greatest minds
  of the 20th century. In 1951, he was convicted of “gross indecency” and
  chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with
  cyanide. This is his story.

  Turing was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed "Codebreaking Castle"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests –- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.

## Deciphering the Enigma

In the early 20th century, the German military used Enigma machines to encrypt secret communications. They used the machines to send messages and orders to commanders and soldiers at all fronts -- so that, in theory, the British couldn’t intercept the messages. But Turing and his colleagues in the “Cryptanalytic” department at Bletchley Park were able to crack the code.
Most of Turing’s team worked with machines that had been modified from commercial typewriters. Through trial-and-error, they discovered that the types of letters and spacing on the Enigma machine were identical to those of the typewriter. So, the team used a machine that could type letters on a paper “band” and then lift them off one-by-one for analysis.

## Artificial Intelligence

As part of his work, Turing created the first “artificial intelligence” machine: a computer that could simulate a person’s intelligence.
By feeding this machine information about a person, he could then feed it information about another person and have it simulate how the first person would react to the second.

## Music and the Brain

One of the most interesting aspects of Turing’s life was his interest in music and how it affects the brain.
During the war, Turing created machines that could play music automatically. These machines were designed to help create music by following a set of instructions. Turing also created a machine that could scan a person’s brain and measure the amount of oxygen in their blood. He used this machine to detect whether a person was experiencing a headache or other pain.

## The Computing Machine That Is “Turing”

The Turing machine is a concept that combines a computing machine and a programming language. The idea is that the user writes a program on paper by creating a series of boxes for each step.
Using this programming language, you can program a computer to perform a task and then repeat it as many times as needed. Turing’s machine was a revolutionary idea that would later influence the creation of all modern computers.

## Turing’s Test for Human Consciousness

In 1950, Turing published “Computing machinery and intelligence,” in which he famously proposed a test to determine whether a computer or human was expressing genuine intelligence.
If a human was talking to a computer and was unable to distinguish whether it was a computer or human being on the other side of the conversation, Turing believed it would be proof that the computer was intelligent. This has been called “Turing’s test.”

## Conclusion

In 1936, Alan Turing was born in the UK. He was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist who broke the Enigma code during WWII. During the 1950s, he was convicted of "gross indecency" for being gay and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide.
This is his story.
