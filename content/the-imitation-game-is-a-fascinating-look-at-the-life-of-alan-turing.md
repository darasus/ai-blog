The Imitation Game is a fascinating look at the life of Alan Turing, one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century. Turing was a mathematician, computer scientist, and codebreaker who helped crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II. After the war, he was convicted of homosexuality and chemically castrated. He committed suicide two years later.

The film, directed by Morten Tyldum, stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. Cumberbatch gives a brilliant performance, conveying the genius and pain of a man who was ahead of his time. The film also stars Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Turing's fellow codebreaker and only friend.

The Imitation Game is a must-see for anyone interested in history or in the life of one of the most fascinating and tragic figures of the 20th century.
