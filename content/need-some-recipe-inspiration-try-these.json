The first challenge of the series was the Signature Bake, where contestants had to make something inspired by childhood memories. This week’s Signature Challenge was one of the trickiest yet on Bake Off: the dreaded Pasty Challenge. The contestants were challenged to make a meat and potato pasty — an unusual combination. They had to create a three-tiered cake decorated with a novelty design or feature. These recipes are perfect for sharing with friends, family or even even a complete baker.",

The Great British Bake Off is back with a brand new batch of amateur bakers ready to tackle tricky challenges. Instead of the usual judges, this time we have Prue, Noel and Sandi testing their skills in the kitchen.\nFor those who aren\\u2019t familiar with the show, The Great British Bake Off is a contest where amateur bakers are tested on their baking skills. Contestants are asked to make pastry-based dishes that often feature unusual or difficult techniques, and are judged on appearance, taste and originality. In each episode they face two different challenges: a Signature Bake where they must create something using a specific ingredient or theme as inspiration; and a Technical Challenge which might see them making croquembouche or another difficult dish.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
