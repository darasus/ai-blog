In fact, the organic food market is growing faster than any other segment of the food industry. According to the Organic Trade Association, sales of organic foods increased by almost 10% in 2017 alone. And given that more and more consumers are becoming aware of what they\\u2019re eating and where it comes from, that isn\\u2019t going to change anytime soon. Which begs the question: Are all those new organic options worth it? Do they really taste better than conventional alternatives? Are they healthier for you? And most importantly, is the cost worth it?\nIf you read through all the information on different types of organic foods and their benefits, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed right now. That\\u2019s totally normal! But don\\u2019t fret\\u2014we have you covered with everything you need to know about whether or not organic is worth its hefty price tag.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

That\\u2019s because carbohydrates are a source of sugars known as \\u201Csimple carbs\\u201D (also called digestible or digestible natural sugars). These simple carbs are quickly broken down by the body and raise your blood sugar level quickly.\nIf you consume more than 20g of carbohydrate per day, that\\u2019s considered high intake. High intake of carbohydrates can lead to an excess production of glycogen in the liver, which is converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue, particularly around the belly. Once these fats reach dangerous levels they trigger the production of stress hormones like cortisol which has been linked to insulin resistance, high cholesterol, obesity and fatty liver disease.\nHowever, not all carbs are bad for you \\u2013 in fact some types are essential for good health.
