## Know the menu selection options in advance

Eating out at a restaurant or a cafe is often a spur-of-the-moment affair, but knowing a little about the menu selection in advance can make a huge difference in how healthy your choice is. Popular restaurants like Applebee’s, Chili’s, and others serve burgers, steaks, and other typical “American fare” that is packed with calories, fat, sodium, and carbs. Ordering a salad may be a healthier choice, but keep in mind that many eateries toss the lettuce with a high-calorie, high-fat salad dressing that quickly turns your otherwise healthy choice into something extremely unhealthy.
In this case, ordering a salad is still a better option than a burger or steak, provided you order it without the dressing and ask for olive oil and vinegar as dressing substitutes. Asian and Indian restaurants are another good option to consider, as most feature “light” versions of traditional meals. Chinese restaurants are another good bet, as many feature dishes that are low in calories and sodium, but don’t skimp on taste.

## Go for protein and veggie-based dishes

The first thing you should do is to choose a protein-based meal, such as fish, chicken, or tofu, as the primary component of your meal. Most restaurant menus feature salads, soups, and other healthy table side dishes that all feature either protein or veggies as the primary source of calories. If you choose a protein-based meal, you’ll get a healthy helping of veggies as well.

Now, if you’re having a meal with a significant other or friends, you don’t want to order a plain and uninspiring piece of grilled or boiled chicken. Instead, order a protein-based meal that also has a healthy side dish, such as a grilled salmon with a side of steamed broccoli. You’ll get a healthy dose of protein from the salmon and broccoli, and the broccoli will help negate some of the potential negative effects of consuming a fair amount of protein.

## Check the calories in advance

While you’re at the restaurant, check the calories in advance to make sure that you’re not ordering a meal that would significantly exceed your daily calorie intake. Many restaurants now have their menu items listed with the number of calories for each dish, which can make the selection process much easier.
Finding the “Nutrition” or “Calories” section on the menu will greatly simplify this process. Be sure to check the serving size, too, as that may be far less than you expect. A good example of this is the serving size of rice at many Asian restaurants, which is rarely a full serving. Another potential pitfall is the number of calories in drinks, especially those that are fruity and contain a lot of sugar.

## Go for healthy side dishes or add-ons

At most restaurants, you can get a side dish that comes with the meal. Many of the healthy side dishes are starchy, such as rice or a baked potato. If you’re trying to avoid the starches, though, you’ll have to go for some of the healthy side dishes that don’t contain starch as a primary source of calories, such as vegetables, green beans, etc.
In addition to the healthy side dishes, you can also ask the server if you can get some olive oil, vinegar, lemon, or any other healthy condiment to go with your meal. You may also want to ask if you can get a half-portion of the meal if you’re not overly hungry. This will allow you to choose from the healthy side dishes and avoid eating too much of the main portion.

## Order a helping of steamed veggies

If you want to go for a healthy choice, but don’t feel like you’ll enjoy the vegetables that come with the meal, then you can order a helping of steamed vegetables as a side dish. A good example of this is an Asian meal like shrimp lo mein or Chinese stir-fry with a side of steamed broccoli. The broccoli will provide a good dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, while the lo mein or stir-fry will be a good source of protein.
In addition to broccoli, you can also order a side of green beans, carrots, or any other vegetable that you enjoy and consider healthy. You can even ask if you can get a side of fruit or a small bowl of rice pudding for dessert if you feel like you need a sweet treat after your meal.

## Turning baked goods into savory meals

Many restaurants also bake fresh breads each day and serve it with their meals. While there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a piece of bread with your meal, it often contains a significant amount of calories and fat. If you want to enjoy the bread, but don’t want to take in a large amount of calories, you can ask the server if you can get the bread to be made into a savory dish, such as breadcrumbs baked into a breaded chicken breast or fish.
Breadcrumbs baked into a breaded chicken breast or fish is usually served with a side of vegetable rice, another healthy choice. If you don’t want to get a side dish, you can always ask the server to leave out the vegetable rice.

## Bottom line

Eating out is a great way to let yourself relax and enjoy a meal without having to do the cooking and cleaning up. The challenge, though, is to find a healthful option on the menu that won’t break your calorie bank. By following the tips in this article, you can make healthier choices when eating out so you can enjoy your meal without feeling guilty about it.
