Moreover, it means you can plan around any dietary restrictions you may have.\nFor example, if you know you\\u2019re going to be away from home between meal times, you can pack healthy snacks to avoid feeling pressured into making unhealthy choices. This can help you avoid making bad food choices simply because you\\u2019re hungry.\nAdditionally, if you plan your meals in advance, it becomes easier to avoid overspending at the grocery store.

Fruits and vegetables are also packed full of essential vitamins and minerals, as well as being low in calories.\nIn addition, many fruits and vegetables also contain fibre, which can help you to feel fuller for longer when you include them in your diet.

Specifically, if you want to eat a healthy diet, you should combine different types of food.\nThis is because you need to get a variety of nutrients in your diet to stay fit and healthy.

This is a good rule of thumb for making healthier choices generally, and is even more important when you\\u2019re hungry.\nFor example, if you are craving a snack, ask yourself why you are craving it.
