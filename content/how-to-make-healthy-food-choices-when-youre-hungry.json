The pace of modern life means that most people spend more time commuting, at work and in front of screens than ever before. As a result, the number of times people feel hungry but have no convenient food options to hand has increased.\nThis has led to a culture where people tend to eat whenever and wherever they can, almost irrespective of what they are consuming or how healthy it is. However, while being hungry is never a bad thing, overeating at any time \\u2013 let alone all of them \\u2013 isn\\u2019t great either.\nIf you\\u2019re reading this article right now because you struggle with hunger often and want some ideas on how to make healthier food choices when you\\u2019re hungry, we think you\\u2019ll find some useful pointers here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

When you know exactly what you\\u2019re going to have to eat at each mealtime, it becomes far easier to make healthy choices.\nThis is because you have time to think about what you\\u2019re going to consume and consider how it will affect your overall diet. Moreover, it means you can plan around any dietary restrictions you may have.\nFor example, if you know you\\u2019re going to be away from home between meal times, you can pack healthy snacks to avoid feeling pressured into making unhealthy choices. This can help you avoid making bad food choices simply because you\\u2019re hungry.\nAdditionally, if you plan your meals in advance, it becomes easier to avoid overspending at the grocery store. This is because you can make a list of everything you need, and stick to it when you\\u2019re shopping.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t Be Afraid Of Fruit And Vegetables\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`For many people, eating a healthy diet means eating a lot of meat, fish and eggs. Indeed, for many people the phrase \\u2018eating healthy\\u2019 means \\u2018eating more meat\\u2019. However, a good rule of thumb is that if something was around a lot longer than human beings, eat it!\nThis means that you should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, as these are some of the oldest foods in the world. Fruits and vegetables are also packed full of essential vitamins and minerals, as well as being low in calories.\nIn addition, many fruits and vegetables also contain fibre, which can help you to feel fuller for longer when you include them in your diet. This can help to reduce the risk of overeating when you\\u2019re hungry.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Combine Proteins And Carbohydrates\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Another way to make healthy food choices when you\\u2019re hungry is to combine proteins and carbohydrates in your meals. This is because the combination of these two types of food is extremely common in modern meals. For example, sandwiches, burgers, tacos and pasta are all meals that combine carbohydrates and proteins.\nEncouragingly, research shows that this type of combination is extremely common in healthy eating. Specifically, if you want to eat a healthy diet, you should combine different types of food.\nThis is because you need to get a variety of nutrients in your diet to stay fit and healthy. If you only eat one type of food, you aren\\u2019t getting everything you need.\nHowever, if you combine different types of food, you get a more well-rounded diet.

Healthy fats are essential for the human body, and can help to protect against many diseases.\nHowever, it can be easy to miss out on healthy fats when you\\u2019re hungry. This is because many foods that are high in healthy fats are also high in calories. For example, nuts, seeds, avocado and certain types of fish are great sources of healthy fats.\nHowever, people who are looking to slim down generally avoid these foods because they are high in calories. If you\\u2019re trying to make healthy food choices when you\\u2019re hungry, you should try to include healthy fats in your diet.\nThis can help to keep you fuller for longer, as well as providing you with important nutrients that protect your body from diseases.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Weigh Up The Pros And Cons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`When you\\u2019re hungry, it can be easy to make poor food choices.

This is a good rule of thumb for making healthier choices generally, and is even more important when you\\u2019re hungry.\nFor example, if you are craving a snack, ask yourself why you are craving it. Do you really need the snack, or are you just hungry? If you\\u2019re just hungry, you should find something healthier to eat.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don't Forget About Snacking!\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the best ways to make healthy food choices when you\\u2019re hungry is to make sure you\\u2019re snacking between meals.\nWhen you snack between meals, you give your body the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and active.
