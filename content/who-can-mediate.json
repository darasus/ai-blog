  "content": "## What Can You Mediate?\n\nYou may be able to mediate many different types of disputes, including those involving real estate, employment, family law, and insurance issues. Also, mediation is a great way to resolve contractual disputes. For example, if you have a contract dispute with a business, you can use mediation to try to resolve the issue. Even if you aren’t sure what type of dispute you have, it’s worth asking if mediation can help you resolve your issue.\n\nYou may be able to mediate conflicts that aren’t a typical lawsuit. For example, you may be able to mediate if you’re dealing with issues surrounding disputes with neighbors, disagreements between tenants and landlords, or even issues with your family. You might also be able to mediate your child’s or spouse’s school disciplinary issues or disputes with your insurance company over a claim.\n\n## Age and Income Requirements\n\nYou may need to meet an age requirement or an income requirement to participate in mediation. For example, the Legal Aid Society in New York City has a mediation program for low- or middle-income residents who have a housing-related dispute, such as a landlord-tenant matter.\n\nIf you’re applying for a mediation program that has an income requirement, you might be required to sign a waiver to be exempt from paying the program’s fee. Be sure to check the program’s website or contact it directly to learn more about any age or income requirements.\n\n## Legal Status Requirements\n\nYou may need to meet a legal status requirement to participate in mediation. For example, the Center for Dispute Settlement in California has a mediation program for tenants who have a dispute with their landlords. Only tenants who have a dispute with their landlords can participate in the program.\n\nIf you’re applying to a mediation program that has a legal status requirement, you might be required to sign a waiver to be exempt from meeting that requirement. Be sure to check the program’s website or contact it directly to learn more about any legal status requirements.\n\n## Program-Specific Requirements\n\nSome mediation programs have other requirements that you need to meet in order to participate in the program. For example, the Center for Dispute Settlement in California has a mediation program for tenants who have a dispute with their landlord, but participants must be on the waiting list for housing assistance.\n\nIf you’re applying to a mediation program that has program-specific requirements, you might be required to sign a waiver to be exempt from meeting those requirements. Be sure to check the program’s website or contact it directly to learn more about any program-specific requirements.\n\n## Who Can Mediate a Real Estate Dispute?\n\nIn some cases, you may need a real estate agent or lawyer to mediate your real estate dispute. For example, the Center for Dispute Settlement in California has a mediation program for landlords and tenants. Landlords have the right to choose which mediation program they want to use, and their tenants have the right to choose their own mediator. Tenants can choose any mediator, but landlords must choose a mediator who is a real estate agent or a lawyer.\n\nIf you’re applying to a mediation program where one or both parties must be a real estate agent or lawyer, you might be required to sign a waiver to be exempt from meeting that requirement. Be sure to check the program’s website or contact it directly to learn more about this requirement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMediation is a great way to resolve your legal dispute, but it’s not for everyone. If you’re eligible to mediate, that might depend on the type of case you have and who you are. For example, there may be other requirements that you meet to qualify as an eligible candidate.\nMediation eligibility can differ depending on whether the dispute resolution program requires participants to be from a certain income level or has other prerequisites such as being a homeowner or having a specific legal status. You should also keep in mind that some programs may require mediation only when parties can’t agree on a settlement and not necessarily as an initial step in their process for resolving disputes."
