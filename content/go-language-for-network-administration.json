It was intended to be easy to read and understand, even for developers who were not experienced with programming. The designers of Go also wanted the language to be able to handle the huge scale of Google\\u2019s infrastructure.

The language has been designed so that the majority of bugs that cause systems to crash or behave unexpectedly are caught by the compiler or the type system.

People can then use your code in their projects by simply adding a few lines to their code and typing \\u201Cimport \\u201D at the top of the file.\nYou can also use Go to create programs that run on your computer instead of a server.

It\\u2019s easy to read and understand and has a much simpler syntax than other programming languages such as C or Java. Its simple syntax, readability, and general ease of use have made Python an extremely popular choice for new programmers. According to the census of programming languages from PYPL, Python is the third most widely used programming language globally with a usage of about 20%. Furthermore, Python was also identified as one of the top 10 fastest growing computer languages.
