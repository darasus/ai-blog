It was intended to be easy to read and understand, even for developers who were not experienced with programming. The designers of Go also wanted the language to be able to handle the huge scale of Google\\u2019s infrastructure. Go was designed to be statically typed, which means that each variable is assigned a type when the program is written and cannot be changed.

The language has been designed so that the majority of bugs that cause systems to crash or behave unexpectedly are caught by the compiler or the type system.

People can then use your code in their projects by simply adding a few lines to their code and typing \\u201Cimport \\u201D at the top of the file.\nYou can also use Go to create programs that run on your computer instead of a server.
