Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques.

It was created as a response to the growing complexity of these languages and the difficulty of finding developers who could work in them.\nThe design of Go was inspired by previous languages, such as C and Pascal. It was intended to be easy to read and understand, even for developers who were not experienced with programming. The designers of Go also wanted the language to be able to handle the huge scale of Google\\u2019s infrastructure. Go was designed to be statically typed, which means that each variable is assigned a type when the program is written and cannot be changed. This makes it easier to catch mistakes when a program is written.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Should Network Administrators Learn Go?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Go is a simple language that\\u2019s designed to solve a very specific set of problems. To make sure that it only solves these problems and doesn\\u2019t also introduce new ones, the language is kept as simple as possible. This simplicity is what makes it such a great choice for network administrators.\nThe main advantage that network administrators get from using Go is that it is easy to write reliable code. The language has been designed so that the majority of bugs that cause systems to crash or behave unexpectedly are caught by the compiler or the type system. This means that the chance of your code breaking once it\\u2019s been deployed is much lower, which makes it a great choice for long-term software projects.\nIf you\\u2019re a network administrator, this is great news as you\\u2019ll spend less time debugging and more time deploying features that help your users.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Can Network Administrators Use Go?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Go is an open source language, so anyone can use it for free. There are public repositories where network administrators can find other people\\u2019s code and pieces of code that they can use in their own projects.\nWhen you\\u2019re writing code in Go, you can share it with other people using a hosting service called GitHub. People can then use your code in their projects by simply adding a few lines to their code and typing \\u201Cimport \\u201D at the top of the file.\nYou can also use Go to create programs that run on your computer instead of a server. This can be done by creating a binary file that can be run directly on your computer.

However, if you want to get the most out of your learning experience, you should consider joining a coding bootcamp or taking an online course. Bootcamps offer more immediate feedback on your progress and help you to build a network of like-minded individuals that can support you long after the course ends.\nAdditionally, many bootcamps offer scholarships or other financial aid if you show that network administration is your career goal. Online courses are also a great way to accelerate your learning process and make sure that you\\u2019re learning the right skills.
