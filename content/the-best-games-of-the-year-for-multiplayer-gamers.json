In 2018, we saw new entries in long-running series like Red Dead Redemption, Assassin\\u2019s Creed, and Halo as well as brand new IP such as Monster Hunter: World, Into the Breach, and A Way Out. It was a year that saw game developers pushed by streaming services like Twitch and YouTube continue to experiment with new ideas and designs while also returning to their roots with older properties.\nThat being said, not all games are created equal. There are excellent games and then there are... others less so. To help you sort through the deluge of new releases this year, Gamers Central has compiled a list of our top ten favorite titles coupled with an even longer list of disappointments that you may want to avoid entirely or at least wait for a sale before picking up.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
