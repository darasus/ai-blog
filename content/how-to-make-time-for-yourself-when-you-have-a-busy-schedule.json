When you have a clear idea of when you have some time for yourself coming up, it will be easier for you to plan out your activities and make time for yourself.\nFor instance, you might know that you don\\u2019t have any evening commitments for the next couple of weeks.

It\\u2019s also about eating the right types of food in the right quantities to ensure you get all the nutrients your body needs.\nIt won\\u2019t come as a surprise to most of you, but the way you eat can have a big impact on how much weight you gain or lose, and what type of health risks you might face.
