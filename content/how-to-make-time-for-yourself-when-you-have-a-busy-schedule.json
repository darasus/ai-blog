You can\\u2019t expect to suddenly be able to make time for yourself when you feel like you have no time at all.\nFor starters, you can actually look at your calendar (or the calendar of your work) and see when you have some free time. When you have a clear idea of when you have some time for yourself coming up, it will be easier for you to plan out your activities and make time for yourself.\nFor instance, you might know that you don\\u2019t have any evening commitments for the next couple of weeks.
