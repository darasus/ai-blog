Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server. Furthermore, we\\u2019ll discuss why blockchain technology is particularly well suited to meet this challenge with enhanced security measures and increased transparency.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is made possible by the use of cryptographic keys that allow users to authenticate themselves. The keys authenticate users by confirming their identity based on unique identifiers such as their email address or phone number. Once a user has been authenticated, he or she can interact with the blockchain network to securely store data.\nThe blockchain network operates autonomously without an intermediary by using smart contracts to automatically execute the terms and conditions established by the parties involved in the transaction. The decentralized design of the blockchain network means that there is no single entity to whom users must outsource trust.

This type of automation could save time and resources, as well as reduce opportunities for fraud.\nSimilarly, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that manage confidential data. These contracts can specify the terms and conditions by which data owners can transmit their data to third parties. Smart contracts can also specify the terms and conditions by which data owners can request that third parties return their data.\nBy using blockchain technology to establish smart contracts that manage access to confidential data, businesses can provide assurances to their data owners that their information will be secure.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Limiting Access to Confidential Data with Smart Contracts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`When managing confidential data, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that limit access to only those parties that have authenticated themselves. The contracts can also specify the terms and conditions under which those third parties can access the data.\nBy limiting access to only authenticated users, businesses can protect confidential data from malicious actors who may try to impersonate legitimate users. Furthermore, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that unlock access to data once the parties involved have fulfilled the specified terms and conditions. For example, a healthcare company might use blockchain technology to create a smart contract that ensures that a computer at a specific location will only release a user\\u2019s medical data to a healthcare provider after the user has signed a consent form and paid their medical bill.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Auditing and Tracking Confidential Data with Blockchains\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Blockchain technology can also be used to audit and track the provenance of confidential data.

This information is logged on the blockchain ledger and can be verified by anyone who has access to the ledger.\nBy logging the provenance of data, businesses can provide assurances to their clients that they are being transparent about how they are using the data. This could be especially important where sensitive data is concerned, such as in the healthcare sector, where consumers may be wary of giving out their data.\nBy auditing and tracking data, businesses can also be held accountable for their actions. If, for example, a healthcare company were to misuse a patient\\u2019s data, the blockchain ledger would make it clear when and how the data was accessed, as well as who accessed it.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Shoring up Security with Strong Encryption Practices\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Finally, blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the security of data by using strong encryption practices.

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!

It\\u2019s the first example of a cryptocurrency, an asset that can be easily transferred between users (or \"adapters\") and also has a fixed supply. This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.\nThe creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\nThere are a number of factors that could continue to drive demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
