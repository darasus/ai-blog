Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server.

This type of automation could save time and resources, as well as reduce opportunities for fraud.\nSimilarly, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that manage confidential data. These contracts can specify the terms and conditions by which data owners can transmit their data to third parties.

This could be especially important where sensitive data is concerned, such as in the healthcare sector, where consumers may be wary of giving out their data.\nBy auditing and tracking data, businesses can also be held accountable for their actions.
