Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before.
