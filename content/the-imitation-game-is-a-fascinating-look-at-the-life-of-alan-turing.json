Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

The Korean sextet has made a name for itself as not just another boy band but one that plays its own instruments and has choreographed dance routines that are so intricate they sometimes require special stage lighting.\nArmed with these weapons, BTS has twice cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart with its Love Yourself series. And the latest installment of this series \\u2014 which doubles as its sixth EP \\u2014 is no exception.\nFurthermore, it\\u2019s the strongest of the bunch.\nIt\\u2019s impossible to talk about BTS without mentioning their massive following beyond Korea: Vivid, obsessive ARMYs (as they call them) who follow their every move and buy everything associated with them. This is why many people assume they are only famous because of social media and pandering ads (which is true). However, anyone who listens to their music will tell you that they deserve all this success. \\u201CLove Yourself: Tear\\u201D proves it once again.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives. The result is something like a documentary on human development \\u2014 funny, sad, awkward, and everything in between \\u2014 presented through the lens of an intimate cinematic experience.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
