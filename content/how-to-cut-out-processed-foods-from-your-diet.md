If you're trying to eat healthier, you may be looking to cut out processed foods from your diet. But what exactly are processed foods? And how can you avoid them?

Processed foods are defined as foods that have been altered from their natural state. This can include adding or removing ingredients, as well as changing the physical form of the food. Processed foods are often high in sugar, salt, and fat, and can be lacking in important nutrients like fiber and vitamins.

So how can you avoid processed foods? Here are some tips:

1. Read labels carefully. When shopping, take the time to read the labels on food packages. Look for items that are made with whole, unprocessed ingredients.

2. Shop the perimeter of the grocery store. The outer edges of the store are typically where you'll find the freshest and most unprocessed foods.

3. Make meals from scratch. Cooking at home allows you to control exactly what goes into your food. Avoid processed ingredients by making meals from scratch using fresh, whole ingredients.

4. Avoid convenience foods. Foods that come in boxes, bags, and cans are often highly processed. Instead, opt for fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

5. Plan ahead. It's easier to avoid processed foods when you have a plan. Meal planning and prepping ahead of time can help you make healthier choices when you're short on time or hungry.

 following these tips can help you cut out processed foods from your diet and make healthier choices for your overall health.
