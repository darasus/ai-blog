## Why You Should Ditch The Processed Foods

There are many reasons why you should ditch the processed foods. First of all, they are almost always less nutritious than their unprocessed counterparts.
In order to make them last longer, manufacturers often add preservatives, artificial colors, artificial flavors, etc. These ingredients are usually less healthy than the original foods that they are altering.
Another important reason to ditch processed foods is that they are generally more expensive than unprocessed foods.
This is because they have a shorter shelf life and are often imported from other countries.
Processed foods also tend to be higher in sodium and lower in fiber than unprocessed foods, which can adversely affect your health if you consume them regularly.

## Nutritional Benefits of Eating Unprocessed Foods

Another reason to switch to eating only unprocessed foods is that you will be getting more nutrients. There are some nutrients like Vitamin C that are water-soluble. This means that the body can only store a little bit of this vitamin at any given time. When it runs out of its supply of Vitamin C, it takes it from the foods that you eat. Therefore, if you eat a lot of Vitamin C-rich foods, your body will be less likely to deplete its supply. However, if you eat vitamin C-rich foods that have been processed, your body will be less likely to take it from those foods. This means that you will be less likely to get the full amount of Vitamin C that you need.
Typically, unprocessed foods are more likely to be high in the following vitamins: Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Folate, Thiamin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium and Iron.

## 5 Easy Ways to Cut Out Processed Foods from Your Diet

- Plan your meals in advance. When you know what you are going to be eating, you’ll be less likely to succumb to the temptation of buying and eating processed foods.
- Keep the healthy alternatives to processed foods at the front of your pantry. If you are always in front of the processed foods, you are much more likely to eat them.
- Be aware of the ingredients in your snacks. Many processed snacks contain ingredients that are harmful to your health. Be particularly aware of high fructose corn syrup and MSG, as these are added to a lot of processed foods.
- Write down a list of reasons why you want to avoid processed foods and put it where you will see it. If you can’t see the reasons, you are less likely to avoid them.
- Finally, don’t get discouraged if you eat a processed food once in a while.

## 6 Tips for Choosing Healthy Unprocessed Foods

- Shop in the produce section. This is where the majority of unprocessed foods are located.
- Avoid foods that come in cans, boxes or jars. This includes things like pasta, baked beans, peanut butter, etc.
- Stay away from foods that contain a lot of added salt, sugar or starch.
- Check the label to see where the food comes from. If it doesn’t say, it is probably processed.
- Pay attention to the price of the food. If it is ridiculously low, there is usually a reason why.
- Read the ingredients list. If you don’t know what something is, you probably shouldn’t eat it.

## Conclusion

The difference between processed foods and unprocessed foods is more than just the length of their shelf life. Eating unprocessed foods is more likely to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to function properly, along with the vitamins and minerals that help promote good health. The best way to make sure you are eating healthy unprocessed foods is to plan your meals in advance and make sure you always have healthy snacks on hand.
