## Plan Your Meals

The first step to eating a healthy diet is planning your meals. You can’t expect to eat a healthy diet if you don’t know what you’re going to eat. Plan your meals around whole ingredients, and try to avoid processed foods as much as possible.
When planning your meals, think about what’s available in your local grocery store – don’t just rely on processed foods because they’re easy to grab. If you plan your meals using whole ingredients, you can also save some money on your grocery bill.
To make sure you have a healthy, balanced diet, make sure to eat a variety of foods from all of the different food groups. 

## Shop The Perimeter

Every grocery store has a “perimeter” – an area where all the fresh produce, dairy, and meats are located. Shop this area as much as possible, and avoid the aisles where you’ll find things like bread, breakfast cereals, and snack bars.
Most processed foods are found at the center of the store, so by shopping the perimeter, you can avoid as many of these foods as possible.

If you’re buying canned or packaged foods, make sure to check the ingredients list. Look for products with as little added sugar, salt, and preservatives as possible.

## Make Whole Grains The Priority

Whole grains are an important part of any healthy diet. They’re loaded with fiber, minerals, and B vitamins, and they can help keep your blood sugar more balanced.
If you’re not used to eating whole grains, it might take some time to get used to the change.
If you want to incorporate more whole grains into your diet, start with breakfast. Switch from eating pancakes or cereal made with refined grains to a bowl of oatmeal.

## Watch Out For Hidden Sugars

Some people might be under the impression that eating healthy means avoiding all sugars.
That’s simply not the case. All carbohydrates (including sugars) are broken down into glucose, which is the body’s main source of energy.
A healthy diet includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are naturally full of sugars. The problem is that some processed foods also contain lots of added sugars – but those sugars aren’t as obvious.
To avoid added sugars, it’s important to read the nutrition facts on the back of the food packaging. There are also mobile apps that help you identify which ingredients are in your food.

## Watch Out For Artificial Ingredients

Some foods contain a lot of added ingredients that you might not expect.
Take a look at the back of some of your favorite cereals. You might be surprised to find that many of them contain artificial flavors and dyes – two ingredients that you probably don’t want to eat regularly.
You should also check the list of ingredients in some of your favorite snacks. Many potato chips and crackers contain partially hydrogenated oils – which are linked to heart disease.

## Conclusion

A diet rich in processed foods and unhealthy fats is linked to a number of health problems. The best way to avoid this type of food is by eating whole foods instead of processed or packaged ones.
Every person is different, and what might not agree with one person won’t necessarily have the same effect on another. Some people thrive on a high-protein diet, while others do much better with more complex carbs like those found in fruits, veggies, and whole grains.
However, there are some general guidelines that work for almost everyone: Avoid processed foods as much as possible and focus on fresh ingredients whenever you can. This article will outline some tips that can help you cut out processed foods from your diet.
