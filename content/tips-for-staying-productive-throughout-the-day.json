Even the most experienced founders will often launch a new business and see it fail, sometimes several times over. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the risks involved with launching a startup by testing your idea as early as possible with inexpensive methods.\nStartup failure is an unfortunate but inevitable part of the startup process. Even if you have great ideas and the best team possible, not every company is going to succeed. In fact, according to research from Harvard Business School, about two-thirds of all startups fail within the first five years. However, that doesn\\u2019t mean that launching a startup is a risky venture that you should avoid at all costs.\nIf you\\u2019re thinking about starting your own business and feel like your idea could be a profitable business venture in the long-term, read on to discover some common reasons why startups fail so that you can take measures to avoid those pitfalls in your business plan before it\\u2019s too late.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
