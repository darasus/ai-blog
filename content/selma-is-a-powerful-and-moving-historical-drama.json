Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents.

In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Rather than any superficial discussion of how many different kinds of people there are or whether one kind is better than another, it is an examination of what it means to be an individual in society by exploring the challenges that arise when one appears to be something they are not.\nThe plot follows the life and loves of two women; poor southern waitress Nora (Lilac) and her daughter Sarah who is being raised by her business-minded father George (Thomas). Nora\\u2019s light-skinned daughter falls for local boy Harry (Swayze), who does not know she also has darker blood. Meanwhile, George falls for Vida (Stapleton), a rich blonde socialite who will only marry him if he passes as white.\nImitation of Life offers commentary on racial identity, classism and even pansexuality through these characters, providing insight into their experiences and highlighting inequality wherever it exists.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
