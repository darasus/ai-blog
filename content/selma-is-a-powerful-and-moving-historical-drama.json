This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

The only question is when?\nThis was the sentiment that drove much of popular culture throughout the 70s and 80s. Films like \\u201CMad Max\\u201D and \\u201CThe Road Warrior\\u201D were cautionary tales about the future of mankind brought on by a series of devastating natural and man-made disasters; \"Mad Max\" being set during a prolonged drought, and \"The Road Warrior\" taking place after a catastrophic failure of an oil refinery leads to widespread pollution and destruction as well as a shortage of gasoline (which is what inspired the term \\u201CRoad Warrior\\u201D).\nIn these movies, there are also factions that have arisen to take advantage of these new conditions: In \"Mad Max\", we see gangs whose primary function is to steal fuel from other scavenger tribes; In \"The Road Warrior\", we see roving bands that are essentially highwaymen that prey upon small towns using their road-warrior combat skillset; And in both movies we see heroes who fight against evil not because they want to be evil but because they are good people trying to save those they love in terrible times.\nThese subtexts have been explored time and time again throughout history through literature such as The Bible`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before. In fact, it can be incredibly exciting when musicians dig into who they were as teenagers, young adults and beyond.\nIf you need convincing, just take a listen to Foster the People\\u2019s latest album \\u2013 \\u2018Sacred Hearts Club\\u2019 \\u2013 which is Led Zeppelin meets Weezer with hints of Pink Floyd and other psychedelic influences.
