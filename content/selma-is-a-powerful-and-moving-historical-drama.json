This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

An unhinged social experiment?\nPerhaps all of these things. Let\\u2019s break it down.\nThe \\u201CIn My Feelings\\u201D challenge basically involves someone standing in a public place and dancing along to Drake\\u2019s new song, \\u201CIn My Feelings.\\u201D If they are not at home or in their own car, they will have to record this dance and post it online for all their followers to see.

These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before. In fact, it can be incredibly exciting when musicians dig into who they were as teenagers, young adults and beyond.\nIf you need convincing, just take a listen to Foster the People\\u2019s latest album \\u2013 \\u2018Sacred Hearts Club\\u2019 \\u2013 which is Led Zeppelin meets Weezer with hints of Pink Floyd and other psychedelic influences. Here are five reasons why this LP is proof positive that going back home is the perfect way for any artist to get inspired again.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory.\nThis is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it\\u2019s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse \\u2014 instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.\nA few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete \\u2018A Brief History of Time\\u2019 which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold.

It's also a film about performance, but it's not a concert movie. It is, however, an electrifying and exhilarating portrait of the world of jazz drumming: its practice; its professors; its players; its perfectionists. It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
