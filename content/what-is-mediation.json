Mediation is a voluntary process, and anyone can choose to engage or not to engage. Mediated is a confidential process because it is important to have the freedom to talk openly and honestly. The mediator may be an impartial third party who facilitates the discussion and makes sure the parties are able to explore their issues fully, to exchange information and to negotiate an agreement.
