  "summary": "A mediator facilitates a conversation between two parties in conflict by encouraging them to talk directly to each other and negotiate a resolution. Mediation is a voluntary process, and anyone can choose to engage or not to engage. Mediated is a confidential process because it is important to have the freedom to talk openly and honestly. The mediator may be an impartial third party who facilitates the discussion and makes sure the parties are able to explore their issues fully, to exchange information and to negotiate an agreement. In arbitration, a third party hears both sides of the story, makes a decision and orders the parties to follow the decision.",

The practice of mediation has continued to evolve over time and today there are many different types, including: family mediation, dispute resolution, community mediation, transformative mediation and collaborative law. However, they all have the same core elements and are intended to achieve the same goals: finding common ground between two parties in conflict; preserving personal relationships; and resolving problems constructively by using active listening techniques.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Mediation is a voluntary process, and anyone can choose to engage or not to engage. The mediator does not make a decision for you; rather, the mediator\\u2019s role is to facilitate the conversation and help each party understand each other\\u2019s positions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Depending on the type of mediation, the mediator may be an expert in the subject matter of the dispute. In other cases, the mediator is an impartial third party who facilitates the discussion and makes sure the parties are able to explore their issues fully, to exchange information and to negotiate an agreement.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Confidentiality\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation is a confidential process because it is important to have the freedom to talk openly and honestly. It is a place where people can explore their feelings, interests and needs without fear of judgment or retaliation. However, confidentiality does not mean that the parties are required to agree or that the mediator will not help them to reach a resolution. In fact, mediation is most often successful when parties are able to talk about the issues that are important to them and explore solutions that work for everyone. The mediator will assist them in exploring their interests, exploring options and coming to an agreement that works for everyone.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Confidentiality also means that everything discussed during mediation stays between the parties and the mediator. Unless the information is relevant to the court or other decision-maker, it stays within the mediation process.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Problem-Solving Process\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Most mediations begin with each party presenting their positions and the issues they want to resolve. The mediator may ask questions to help each person understand the other\\u2019s position and may encourage them to ask questions of one another. This is a critical step in mediation because it allows people to explore their interests, understand each other\\u2019s needs and come up with solutions that work for everyone.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Problem-solving also includes brainstorming options for resolving the issues and coming up with ideas about how the parties can work together to implement their solutions. Depending on the situation, mediators may be creative and come up with solutions that have never been tried before.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Mediate?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It may seem counterintuitive to put yourself in a situation where you have to discuss sensitive issues directly with the person you are in conflict with. However, mediation allows everyone to express their feelings and interests without fear of being judged or punished. It is an opportunity for people to talk about what happened, explore their differences, find areas of common ground and create solutions that work for everyone.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mediation vs. Arbitration\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In mediation, both parties come to an agreement that works for them. In arbitration, a third party hears both sides of the story, makes a decision and then orders the parties to follow the decision. Arbitration is voluntary in that the parties can choose to have the arbitrator decide their dispute or they can have the arbitrator make recommendations for their resolution.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation is a voluntary process in which the parties themselves come to an agreement. Mediation can occur before or after a dispute has arisen. Arbitration is typically used after a dispute has arisen and a dispute resolution professional makes a decision that both parties must follow.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mediation vs. Collaborative Law\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In mediation, you and the other party discuss the issues that are important to you and come to an agreement that works for everyone.

Mediation can also be used at any stage in the dispute resolution process. It can be used as a first step in problem-solving to help people see their interests and needs. It can also be used as a final step in dispute resolution to help people agree to a solution and end their dispute.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to determine if mediation is right for you is to talk to a neutral third party and ask questions. What is the process? Who will facilitate the discussion? What will happen if one or both of the parties are not satisfied with the outcome?

It is a chance to talk directly with the person you are in conflict with and come to an agreement that works for you both.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
