Here are some effective ways to make this happen sooner rather than later.\nIf you\\u2019ve recently broken up with your partner or dating partner, it can feel like the end of the world. But it\\u2019s not! A relationship coming to an end does not mean there is something wrong with you or that you aren\\u2019t good enough for anyone or that you will never find love again. Your heart is broken at this moment because you cared deeply about this person - now you just have to understand why and how things went south so that it doesn\\u2019t happen again in your future relationships`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
