For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further.

As a result, more people than ever before are learning how to code as a secondary career option or as a means to break into the tech industry.\nUnfortunately, there are so many coding languages out there that it can be difficult to know where to start. Luckily, we\\u2019re here to help!\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages in existence today with an abundance of demand for qualified programmers. And as one of the most commonly used programming languages for statistical analysis and data science, Python is also extremely useful for web developers looking to branch out from other coding languages like JavaScript or Java.\nKeep reading to discover everything you need to know about Python and why you should learn it!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Whatever your reason for investigating coding, Python is an excellent place to start learning about computer programming and creating your own programs.\nCoding is often a seemingly inaccessible skill, reserved for those with a knack for mathematics or sciences. However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding. The key is finding the right resources and a step-by-step learning process that doesn\\u2019t feel like a burdensome chore.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to begin exploring the wonderful world of Python coding, read on to learn more.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
