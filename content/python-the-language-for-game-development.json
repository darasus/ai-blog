You know that there are many different programming languages out there and that they can be used for different things, but which one is the best one to learn first? Well, you might be surprised to learn that it\\u2019s Python. Why? Because it\\u2019s the language of tomorrow.\nNow you might be thinking: Why does that make it the language of tomorrow? After all, shouldn\\u2019t we be focusing on learning languages like COBOL that will help us in our future career as an accountant or something like that? Well\\u2026 perhaps. But maybe not so much. See, while those other programming languages are great for some things, they aren\\u2019t so great for others. And when we take a look at what other programming languages won\\u2019t be able to do in the future because of their limitations (or maybe just their age), we see why programmers today are saying that Python is going to be the dominant language of tomorrow. Let\\u2019s dive into why by taking a look at several reasons why Python is a fantastic first programming language to learn today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
