intro: >-
  Diversification is one of the most important principles in investing.
  Diversifying your portfolio helps you manage risk and reduce the negative
  effects of a single investment falling dramatically in value.

  If you invest your money in only one stock, mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you’re exposed to the risk that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket. If that stock plunges in value, so does your entire investment. But if you diversify across different types of investments, it’s more likely that at least some of your holdings will not suffer a similar fate.

  A well-diversified portfolio includes numerous asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash; several sizes and types of companies; and perhaps even real estate and alternative assets like private equity or venture capital trusts. Read on to learn more about how to build a diversified investment portfolio.

## Asset Allocation: The key to effective diversification

The most important factor in diversifying your portfolio is asset allocation. This refers to the way you divide your assets among the different types of investments in your portfolio. Your asset allocation should be based on your personal financial situation, investment objectives and risk tolerance.

Common types of investments that comprise a well-diversified portfolio are stocks, bonds and cash. You can also diversify by investing in real estate and alternative assets, such as private equity, venture capital trusts and commodities. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds and cash in various proportions, based on your risk tolerance and time frame for when you’ll need the money.

## Diversify by type of investment

Stocks: There are different types of stocks to choose from, including large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, emerging market stocks, international stocks, value stocks and growth stocks. A diversified investment portfolio should include a mix of all the various types of stocks.

Bonds: Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments, companies or other entities. A diversified investment portfolio should include both government and corporate bonds. A mix of short-, medium- and long-term bonds is also recommended.

Cash: While cash is not a type of investment, it plays two important roles in a diversified portfolio. First, it’s used to pay for the other types of assets in your portfolio. Second, cash can be used to diversify your portfolio by investing in short-term investment vehicles like Treasury bills, commercial paper and money market funds.

## Diversify by size and sector of the company

Size matters when it comes to diversifying your investment portfolio. Large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks are all part of a diversified portfolio. A large-cap company has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion. A mid-cap company has a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion, and a small-cap company has a market capitalization under $2 billion.

Industry sectors: When it comes to diversifying by size and sector, it’s important to choose companies in different industries. A diversified investment portfolio includes a mix of companies in various industries such as biotechnology, healthcare, tech, telecommunications and financial services.

## Diversify by geography and country

Geography: A diversified investment portfolio includes investments in companies based in various regions of the globe. This might mean investing in large-cap companies headquartered in the U.S., mid-cap companies in Asia, small-cap companies in Latin America and emerging market companies in Africa. You can also choose to invest in companies based in different regions outside of North America, such as Europe or Asia.

Country: A diversified investment portfolio also includes stocks of companies based in various countries. This means investing in multinational companies whose business is conducted in different countries. You can also choose to invest in companies based in the same country.

## Don’t forget about cash

While cash is not a type of investment, it plays an important role in a diversified portfolio. Cash can be used to pay for the other types of assets in your portfolio. Moreover, cash can be used to diversify your portfolio by investing in short-term investment vehicles like Treasury bills, commercial paper and money market funds.

## Summary

The most important factor in diversifying your portfolio is asset allocation. Your asset allocation should be based on your personal financial situation, investment objectives and risk tolerance.

To truly diversify your investment portfolio, you should invest in different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, cash and real estate. You should also diversify by size, industry sector and geography. Don’t forget about cash, which can be used to diversify your portfolio and provide liquidity.
