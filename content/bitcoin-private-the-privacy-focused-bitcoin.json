As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base.

In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called \\u201Cpartial fungibility\\u201D: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority.
