In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner.

Online communities have grown to be more accessible and responsive than ever before, leading to speedy innovations and a high level of trust among users. At the same time, new technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and virtual reality are changing the ways we think about apps, projects, and processes moving forward.\nWith so many different factors at play, it can be difficult for startups to know where they should focus their efforts first. Many companies have taken an interest in blockchain technology recently because its decentralized nature makes it an appealing option for creating secure online communities without the risk of a single entity having too much control over members or their data.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
