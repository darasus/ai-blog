Unfortunately, this is not done by default. Instead, it relies on certain precautions being taken, such as using a wallet that obscures IP addresses and using a special protocol that mixes the user\\u2019s \\u2018tumbler\\u2019 inputs with the inputs of other users. Unfortunately, these precautions are not foolproof. While they are enough to remain largely anonymous in casual use, they are insufficient for frequent use.

As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bitcoin transactions need to be verified by a network of distributed nodes, many of which are not incentivized to do so. In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called \\u201Cpartial fungibility\\u201D: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority. This had the added effect of making the system less private without any added benefit.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does Bitcoin Private fix the privacy problem?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin Private was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Similar to Zcash, Bitcoin Private uses a \\u201Czk-SNARK\\u201D type of proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

There is a general feeling that something big is about to happen. The Internet as we know it is changing, and new ways to use data are being invented every day. In this rapidly shifting landscape, blockchain technology stands out as one of the most disruptive innovations.\nBut what exactly is blockchain technology? In a nutshell, it\\u2019s a decentralized ledger that stores information in places called blocks. Whenever someone wants to add information or a transaction to the ledger, they first need to verify themselves by supplying proof of identity. Each block also has its own unique identifier known as a hash. These identifiers help track information easily without having to store an entire copy of each block, which reduces space significantly and speeds up data transfer speeds significantly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
