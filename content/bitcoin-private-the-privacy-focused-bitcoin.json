It was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The fork was airdropped to Bitcoin and ZClassic holders and gave them 1 BTCP for every 1 BTC and ZCL they held when the snapshot was taken.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"A short history of Bitcoin and the privacy problem\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a decentralized digital cash system that could make online payments more convenient, cheaper and more accessible. But as the network and virtual currency grew, Bitcoin\\u2019s lack of privacy became a problem.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A lack of privacy is a serious threat to all financial networks, but it is especially dangerous in a decentralized system like Bitcoin. With no controlling authority, the network must rely on users to report malicious activities. However, if users\\u2019 identities can be linked to their actions, reporting becomes much more difficult.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In Bitcoin, privacy is achieved by obscuring both the sender and recipient of every transaction. Unfortunately, this is not done by default. Instead, it relies on certain precautions being taken, such as using a wallet that obscures IP addresses and using a special protocol that mixes the user\\u2019s \\u2018tumbler\\u2019 inputs with the inputs of other users. Unfortunately, these precautions are not foolproof. While they are enough to remain largely anonymous in casual use, they are insufficient for frequent use. As a result, frequent Bitcoin users\\u2014such as those who use it for online purchases\\u2014have had their identities and wallets linked to their activities.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is Bitcoin not private by default?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin was originally created to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital cash system that could make online payments more convenient, cheaper and more accessible.

A compromise between scalability, decentralization, and privacy.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin\\u2019s privacy issues are rooted in its scalability issues. As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bitcoin transactions need to be verified by a network of distributed nodes, many of which are not incentivized to do so. In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called \\u201Cpartial fungibility\\u201D: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority. This had the added effect of making the system less private without any added benefit.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does Bitcoin Private fix the privacy problem?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin Private was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Similar to Zcash, Bitcoin Private uses a \\u201Czk-SNARK\\u201D type of proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
