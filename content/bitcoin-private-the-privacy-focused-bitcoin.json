However, if users\\u2019 identities can be linked to their actions, reporting becomes much more difficult.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In Bitcoin, privacy is achieved by obscuring both the sender and recipient of every transaction. Unfortunately, this is not done by default. Instead, it relies on certain precautions being taken, such as using a wallet that obscures IP addresses and using a special protocol that mixes the user\\u2019s \\u2018tumbler\\u2019 inputs with the inputs of other users. Unfortunately, these precautions are not foolproof. While they are enough to remain largely anonymous in casual use, they are insufficient for frequent use.

As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bitcoin transactions need to be verified by a network of distributed nodes, many of which are not incentivized to do so. In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called \\u201Cpartial fungibility\\u201D: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority. This had the added effect of making the system less private without any added benefit.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does Bitcoin Private fix the privacy problem?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Bitcoin Private was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Similar to Zcash, Bitcoin Private uses a \\u201Czk-SNARK\\u201D type of proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
