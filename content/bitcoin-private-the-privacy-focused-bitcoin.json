As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bitcoin transactions need to be verified by a network of distributed nodes, many of which are not incentivized to do so. In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called \\u201Cpartial fungibility\\u201D: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority.

It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an earlier version of the blockchain code named \\u201CC Haskell\\u201D and later changed to \\u201CCardano\\u201D. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
