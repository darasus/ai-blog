summary: Oatmeal is another great source of protein and fiber, making it a very
  healthy breakfast option. Eggs contain a decent amount of cholesterol, so if
  you’re at high risk for heart disease, you may want to avoid them. If you're
  worried about the cholesterol in eggs, pair them with foods that lower your
  cholesterol, like chia seeds or flaxseeds. A high-protein diet can help you
  feel full for longer and reduce cravings for sugary snacks. A protein shake is
  a quick and easy way to incorporate more protein into your diet.
intro: >-
  With so many people operating on tight schedules, the majority of us skip
  breakfast. If you find yourself falling into this category, you’re not alone.
  In fact, skipping meals is one of the most common diet pitfalls. Skipping a
  meal or two can lead to an increase in your blood sugar and make it more
  difficult to lose weight. 

  Incorporating healthy breakfasts every day will help keep your metabolism running more efficiently and reduce cravings later on in the day. High-protein breakfasts are especially helpful if you’re trying to lose weight or build muscle. Here are some great ideas for incorporating healthy breakfasts into your regular routine.

## Eggs

Eggs are a great source of protein and are often recommended as a healthy breakfast option. Plus, they’re cheap and easy to prepare. The only potential downside to eating eggs is that they contain a decent amount of cholesterol, so if you’re at high risk for heart disease, you may want to avoid them. When you’re choosing eggs, opt for the ones that are pasture-raised or cage-free.

If you’re worried about the cholesterol in eggs, pair them with foods that lower your cholesterol, like chia seeds or flaxseeds. Chia seeds have a fluffy texture and add a nutty flavor to many dishes. Flaxseeds are a bit crunchy and have an earthy flavor. Both can be added to a variety of dishes and are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.

## Oatmeal

Oatmeal is another great source of protein and fiber, making it a very healthy breakfast option. Plus, it’s very easy to make and can be eaten cold or hot. One downside to eating oatmeal is the high level of sugar found in many brands. To avoid this, try stirring in some natural sweeteners, like honey or maple syrup, to taste.

Be sure to use steel-cut oats as opposed to rolled oats, which are often processed and less nutritious. Steel-cut oats are a whole grain food that take longer to cook, but they’re well worth the wait. Unlike rolled oats, steel-cut oats are minimally processed, so they retain most of their fiber and nutrition.

## Whole grain cereal

Many people think of cereal as a quick and easy breakfast, but most brands aren’t very nutritious. To avoid the sugar-laden varieties, choose whole grain cereal, which contains more fiber and less sugar than its grain-based counterparts. If you’re worried about adding more fiber to your diet, drink a glass of milk with your cereal. Studies show that the calcium in milk helps moderate the blood-sugar-regulating effects of fiber.

If you’re trying to lose weight, be sure to read the nutrition label. Look for low-sugar varieties and select a high-fiber cereal with fewer than 10 grams of sugar per serving. You can also try mixing your own cereal by combining the crunchy parts of different types of cereal.

## Greek yogurt

Yogurt is a great source of protein and calcium, making it a healthy choice for a breakfast. The trick with yogurt is to choose a low-sugar variety. Many brands add a lot of sugar, which isn’t good for your health or your waistline. You can also make your own yogurt by adding a few tablespoons of plain yogurt to a small bowl with a few tablespoons of warm water. Stir well and place in a warm place. It will be ready in a few hours.

If you’re trying to lose weight, fiber is your friend. Look for yogurts with a high amount of fiber and low amount of sugar. Additionally, choosing a yogurt with a high protein content will help you feel full for longer and reduce cravings for sugary snacks.

## Lean protein shake

A quick and easy way to incorporate more protein into your diet is to drink a protein shake. There are many brands on the market, so be sure to read the nutrition facts to find one that fits your dietary needs.

If you’re trying to lose weight, a high-protein diet can help. Protein takes longer to digest than other macronutrients, like carbs and fat, and can help you feel full for longer. Be sure to avoid sugary protein shakes as they’re full of empty calories. Instead, try a protein shake made with almond milk.

## Fruit and veggie shake

Fruit and veggie shakes are another quick, easy and healthy way to start your day. You can make them by adding any combination of the following: bananas, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, kiwi, apples, pears, oranges, carrots, beets, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumbers.

If you’re trying to lose weight, incorporate these into your breakfast rather than adding a high-protein shake. Vegetables and fruits are full of fiber, vitamins and minerals, and won’t leave you feeling hungry. Plus, adding fresh ingredients to your shake is a nice, easy way to add more fresh fruits and veggies to your diet without having to eat them plain.

## Conclusion

Breakfast is often overlooked when people talk about healthy diets and lifestyles, but it’s important to start the day off right with a nutritious meal. There are plenty of options available, so you’re sure to find something that works for you.

Whether you want something savory or sweet, there’s something for everyone. If you’re looking to improve your health, start your day with a healthy breakfast. It’s the easiest way to set yourself up for success.
