intro: >-
  In the 20th century, a group of nations came together to form the Soviet
  Union. This union of communist states collapsed in 1991 and left many people
  wondering how such a powerful alliance could fall apart so quickly. The answer
  lies in the complex nature of the Soviet Union as a union of independent
  states that also operated as part of a centralized government. When combined
  with pressures from outside forces, this unique structure led to the collapse
  of the Soviet Union. 

  The rise and fall of the Soviet Union can be traced back to Vladimir Lenin and his Marxist ideology. In 1917, Lenin led the Bolshevik Revolution and gained control over Russia. At this time, he also introduced policies that would help establish communism throughout Russia and other areas – known as “the fourth partition” – controlled by his Red Army. These policies included state ownership of land and businesses; heavy taxes on landowners; centralization; and controls on trade, production, wages, prices, accounting, exchange rates and foreign currency transactions.

## The Soviet Union after Lenin

After Lenin’s death in 1924, the Soviet Union was led by a group of five men called the “troika,” which included Stalin, as well as Leon Trotsky and Lev Kamenev. After the troika’s falling out and subsequent execution of Trotsky, Stalin emerged as the leader of the Soviet Union. With Lenin’s New Economic Policy, which included private ownership of businesses, now over, Stalin began to centralize and industrialize the Soviet Union. He bought or nationalized all foreign-owned property and created a five-year economic plan for the Soviet Union. This plan included the forced labor of millions of people and the confiscation of grain from the farmers in order to provide food for the cities. The Soviet Union also expanded by invading neighboring nations, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.

## The Rise of Stalin

After Lenin’s death, Stalin’s rise to power was a long and brutal one. Using his control over the party, he eliminated his opponents, including Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, whom he had tried and convicted at the first Moscow show trial in 1936. Stalin also executed his right-hand man, Leon Trotsky, who had fled to Mexico, and then his second right-hand man, Nikolai Yezhov, who had led the main Soviet security agency, the NKVD, at the time of the Great Terror. After these murders, Stalin was the uncontested leader of the Soviet Union. Stalin’s rule brought about some of the worst atrocities of the entire 20th century, including the Holodomor, the Great Terror and the forced marches that led to the death of millions of people, including many Ukrainians who perished during the Holodomor.

## The Brezhnev Era

After Stalin’s death in 1953, the Soviet Union was led by a series of elderly men, including Georgy Malenkov, who served as the prime minister, and then, after his death, Nikita Khrushchev, who led the Soviet Union for more than a decade. In 1964, the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, took control. His rule was marked by a period of general stagnation called the “Brezhnev Era.” During this time, agriculture declined and industry, especially the heavy-polluting mining industry, was allowed to pollute the land and water. Life in the Soviet Union could be characterized as stagnant and uneventful, largely due to the government’s censorship of art, literature and music.

## Drying up the Golden Egg

One of the major problems that plagued the Soviet Union was the declining productivity of its economy. From the 1950s onward, the grain harvest decreased, gradually reaching a point where it was insufficient to feed the entire country. At the same time, the Soviet Union’s economy was becoming more industrialized, so it needed more grain to feed its livestock and support its growing cities. The only solution was to import grain from the U.S. and other countries that had large reserves and were willing to trade it for Soviet oil. In this way, the Soviet Union was able to provide itself with enough grain to feed its people until 1986. But times changed. The Soviet Union fell into debt to the West and began losing money due to the constant need to import grain. Finally, the Soviet Union decided to deal with this problem once and for all by increasing productivity in its agricultural sector.

## Collapse of Belief in the System

After World War II, the Soviet Union occupied many countries of Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary. These countries were occupied by Soviet troops and were therefore called the “satellites.” The Soviet leaders hoped that the people of these countries would see how well the Soviet Union was doing, and eventually want to emulate their example. But the satellite countries did not want to be part of the Soviet Union. They wanted to become independent. The Soviet Union found itself in a difficult situation. If it let the satellite countries go, then it would lose control over them. If it tried to hold on to them, then it might set off a war that could destroy the Soviet Union.

## Endgame: How the Soviet Union Fell Apart

The Soviet Union began to falter in the 1980s due to a mixture of economic, political and social problems. The government failed to respond to the rising needs of its people, which created a growing dissatisfaction. The people of the country had grown tired of the lack of progress, the poor quality of goods and services, and the continued censorship of art, literature and music. The government also failed to meet its production targets, and the Soviet economy went into decline as its debts mounted. There were also internal conflicts between the central government in Moscow and the governments of the satellite states. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, he tried to improve the economy, but his efforts led to a breakdown of the Soviet Union because he did not take account of the leaders in the satellite states. In the end, the Soviet Union fell apart because its structure was based on the idea that all the member states were equal, even though they were not. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, when the people of the satellite states declared their independence.
