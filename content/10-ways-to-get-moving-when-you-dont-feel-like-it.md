1. Just get started. Sometimes the hardest part is just getting started. Once you get your body moving, you'll often find that you have more energy and motivation to keep going.

2. Find an activity that you enjoy. If you don't enjoy the activity you're doing, you're much less likely to stick with it. Find an activity that you look forward to, whether it's going for a walk in nature, playing with your dog at the park, or taking a dance class.

3. Set some goals. Having specific goals to work towards can help give you the motivation you need to keep moving. Whether you're training for a race or trying to lose weight, setting goals will help you stay on track.

4. Make it a habit. The more you do something, the easier it becomes. Try to make physical activity a part of your daily routine so that it becomes second nature.

5. Find a workout buddy. Having someone to workout with can make the experience more enjoyable and help keep you accountable.

6. Join a group or class. There's strength in numbers! Joining a group or class can make working out more fun and motivating.

7. Take it outside. Getting some fresh air can do wonders for your energy levels and motivation. If possible, try to take your workouts outdoors.

8. Make it fun. If working out is a chore, you're much less likely to stick with it. Find ways to make it fun, whether that means listening to music, watching your favorite TV show, or playing a game on your phone.

9. Reward yourself. Give yourself something to look forward to after a workout. Whether it's a healthy snack, a new workout outfit, or some quality time with your favorite people, find something that will motivate you to keep moving.

10. Remember why you're doing it. It's important to keep in mind why you're working out in the first place. Whether it's for your health, your happiness, or something else entirely, remind yourself of your goal and let it keep you going when you don't feel like it.
