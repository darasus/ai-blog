intro: >-
  Did you know that those little brown bag lunches we made in elementary
  school are now a thing again? Super cool, right? Well, sort of. If you’re like
  most adults and teens, you probably don’t have time to pack your own lunch
  every day. Instead, many of us rely on fast food or convenience stores for our
  midday meal. While this can be an affordable and convenient option, these
  places often offer unhealthy food loaded with salt and fat. 

  Fortunately, there are more healthy options out there than you might think. These days there are many drive-through restaurants that serve much healthier versions of the standard fast food menu items. Cafeterias in offices, schools, libraries and other public places also tend to offer healthy choices as well as salad bars and other stations where you can make your own healthy salads or sandwiches.

## The best part? You can make a healthy lunch in only five minutes.

With a little practice, you can even master the art of making your own sandwich in only one minute! Your lunch doesn’t have to be boring either. There are lots of easy ways to make your food more exciting without adding too many calories or fat. By adding just a few simple ingredients and condiments, you can transform just about any sandwich or salad into something that is both delicious and nutritious.

Don’t go hungry!    

If you’re hungry when you sit down to eat, you’re more likely to choose unhealthier foods. Avoid this temptation by eating something light, like a piece of fruit, before you start your lunch break. This will help you to avoid the mid-afternoon slump that often leads to poor food choices.

Watch out for mayo and creamy dressings    

Most creamy salad dressings and sandwiches are high in fat and calories. Instead, try using vinaigrette, a vinegar-based salad dressing, or just plain olive oil. Parmesan cheese, croutons and other crunchy toppings are a great way to add flavor without a lot of calories.

Go for whole grains whenever possible    

Whole grains, like whole wheat bread, are healthier than refined grains, like white bread. Try using whole wheat pita bread or even lettuce wraps instead of bread. You can often find low-sodium versions that are healthier than standard white bread.

Brighten up your sandwich with crunchy toppings    

Vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers are great for adding crunch to a sandwich. Sliced apples, raisins and even nuts are other tasty crunchy toppings. Avoid high-fat ingredients, like fried foods and cheese, that can make your lunch less healthy.

Add some greens to your meal    

Dark, leafy greens, like spinach or kale, are packed with nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Most restaurants will let you add a side salad to your meal. You can also buy bagged salad and other greens that don’t require much prep.
