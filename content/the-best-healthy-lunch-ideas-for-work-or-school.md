Don’t go hungry!    

If you’re hungry when you sit down to eat, you’re more likely to choose unhealthier foods. Avoid this temptation by eating something light, like a piece of fruit, before you start your lunch break. This will help you to avoid the mid-afternoon slump that often leads to poor food choices.

Watch out for mayo and creamy dressings    

Most creamy salad dressings and sandwiches are high in fat and calories. Instead, try using vinaigrette, a vinegar-based salad dressing, or just plain olive oil. Parmesan cheese, croutons and other crunchy toppings are a great way to add flavor without a lot of calories.

Go for whole grains whenever possible    

Whole grains, like whole wheat bread, are healthier than refined grains, like white bread. Try using whole wheat pita bread or even lettuce wraps instead of bread. You can often find low-sodium versions that are healthier than standard white bread.

Brighten up your sandwich with crunchy toppings    

Vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers are great for adding crunch to a sandwich. Sliced apples, raisins and even nuts are other tasty crunchy toppings. Avoid high-fat ingredients, like fried foods and cheese, that can make your lunch less healthy.

Add some greens to your meal    

Dark, leafy greens, like spinach or kale, are packed with nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Most restaurants will let you add a side salad to your meal. You can also buy bagged salad and other greens that don’t require much prep.
