intro: >-
  Microsoft’s new Windows 10 operating system is the company’s attempt to
  reclaim market share lost to Apple and Google. It won’t succeed. Not because
  of technical superiority of other operating systems, but because Microsoft has
  betrayed user trust. 

  The latest version of Windows betrays user privacy by default, as well as through aggressive telemetry data collection, browser tracking, and ad injection. Users who upgrade to Windows 10 can no longer trust their computer or the software that runs on it. 

  When you use Windows 10, Microsoft collects personal information about you, your device usage habits, and apps that you install; all of which is transmitted back to the company in an unencrypted format. These practices are unacceptable and have triggered class-action lawsuits and government inquiries around the world.

## Windows 10: A loss of user trust

Microsoft’s new privacy terms are unacceptable to users who once put their trust in the company. The new Windows 10 privacy policy is written broadly, allowing the company to collect information about you and your device usage that goes beyond what would be necessary for basic functionality. The policy also has a catch-all section that allows Microsoft to take any action necessary to protect its business.
In the age of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, this type of language has no place in a privacy policy.

The company’s practices for Windows 10 data collection are also worrisome. Microsoft has implemented a data collection opt-out process that makes it difficult for users to protect their privacy. Some users have complained that it’s not possible to opt out of all of the Windows 10 data collection.

## Microsoft’s ad injection and browser tracking

The latest version of the Windows 10 operating system tracks user browsing activity and injects adware into Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
This browser tracking and ad injection is done without the consent of the user. It is a violation of the user’s privacy and also a breach of trust between the user and the software vendor.

The Windows 10 ad injection and tracking is implemented using Windows Dynamic Delivery. This tool can be used to serve different versions of an application to users based on their environment. It can also be used to inject ads into the code of an application or website.
What’s troubling is that Dynamic Delivery can be used to inject ads into Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The two open-source browsers maintain their integrity, but the browsing experience is disrupted due to the unwanted ads.

## Windows 10 device telemetry data collection

The Windows 10 operating system collects telemetry data on a device’s operation. This data includes information about installed applications, device driver versions, and application crash logs.
This data collection is done by default on Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro devices.
This data collection is triggered by the installation of software, use of device features, and the installation of software updates.
Telemetry data can be uploaded to Microsoft’s servers as often as every hour.

## Automatic Windows 10 upgrades

The Windows 10 operating system can be configured to automatically download and install updates. This functionality is convenient for users who don’t want to manually check for updates.
Most Windows 10 users have installed the feature that allows the automatic installation of updates. The problem is that the updates are not being tested thoroughly enough before release.
This has led to a series of updates that have caused many issues for users. The most recent Windows 10 October 2018 update caused so many problems that Microsoft had to halt its rollout due to incompatibilities with certain hardware and software.

## Windows 10 safety features that are turned off by default

Some of the new Windows 10 safety features are turned off by default. There are many settings in Windows 10 that can be used to improve privacy, but they have to be enabled manually. Here are a few examples:
By default, Microsoft has turned on the SmartScreen Filter, which blocks executable files from being downloaded from the internet. This is a useful feature, but it is also a privacy concern because it can block legitimate files from being downloaded.
The Windows Defender Security Center is a management console for Windows 10 safety features. If you want to turn off the SmartScreen Filter, you’ll have to visit the Windows Defender Security Center and turn off the feature from there.
This level of separation is problematic because many users are not aware of this management console, and others don’t know how to navigate to it.

## Conclusion

Microsoft’s new Windows 10 operating system is the company’s attempt to reclaim market share lost to Apple and Google. It won’t succeed. Not because of technical superiority of other operating systems, but because Microsoft has betrayed user trust.
The latest version of Windows betrays user privacy by default, as well as through aggressive telemetry data collection, browser tracking, and ad injection. Users who upgrade to Windows 10 can no longer trust their computer or the software that runs on it.
