There is nothing more disheartening than setting high expectations and then falling short of achieving them. If you are new to the idea of productivity, it’s important to keep in mind that it doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a lot of trial and error involved, but don’t give up! When it comes to productivity, it’s all about finding the right system for you.
When it comes to productivity, it’s all about finding the right system for you.

You might find it helpful to think of productivity as a pyramid. At the base is your digital self and at the top is your state of mind. The digital self has to be strong so that you can tap into your state of mind and be truly productive.

## It All Begins With A Morning Routine

Having a productive morning routine is the key to getting your day off to a great start. If you’re not sure how to create one, the good news is that there are a few tried-and-tested ways to kick-start your morning and make sure you are feeling your best throughout the day.

- Wake up 30 Minutes Earlier - It might sound like a tall order, but waking up 30 minutes earlier can make a huge difference to your productivity. This is because you’ll be able to take care of your daily tasks before you are overtaken by the rush hour traffic or the hectic pace of the workplace.
- Plan Your Day - Every productive morning routine should begin with planning your day. Whether you choose to use a pen and paper or your notes app on your smartphone, getting your thoughts down on paper is a great way to get organized before your day begins.
- Set Your Intentions - It might sound a little New Age-y, but setting your intentions at the beginning of each day can help you redirect your focus and set you up for a successful day.

## How To Develop A Productive Morning Routine

Starting your day with a productive morning routine is the best way to get the most out of each and every day. It sets you up for success by helping you to establish good habits that will be beneficial to your productivity and overall well-being.

- Wake Up 15 Minutes Earlier - Waking up 15 minutes earlier than usual is a great way to start your day with a productive morning routine. There are a few reasons for this. First, it gives you a full 30 minutes to prepare for the day, which will allow you to tackle your to-do list with precision.
- Eat A Balanced Breakfast - Make sure you have a healthy breakfast on the table before you hop out of bed. Eating a balanced breakfast can help to fuel your body before you begin your day. It can also help to regulate your blood sugar, which can help to reduce stress.
- Prep Your Workspace - One of the best ways to make sure you are productive throughout the day is to prep your workspace the night before. This will ensure that you are ready to tackle each task with confidence because you will know that you have everything you need right at your fingertips.

## Plan The Day Before

Have you ever found yourself wondering how the rest of the day is going to play out? If so, you are definitely not alone. It can be easy to lose track of time when you are rushing from one task to the next. This is why it’s a good idea to plan the day before it begins.

- Write Down Your Tasks - Before you begin your day, write down all of the tasks that you need to complete. This will help to keep you focused on the present, while giving you a clear plan of action for the day ahead.
- Write Down Your To-Do List in Reverse - This might sound a little confusing at first, but it’s actually a great way to minimize the risk of procrastination. Writing down your to-do list in reverse order (finishing with the big tasks first) can help to boost your productivity because you will feel as though you are closing out the day with a sense of achievement.

## Make Your Workspace Work For You

Whether you work from home, in an office, or at a coffee shop, you need to make your workspace work for you. This means setting up your desk with everything you need before you begin to tackle your tasks for the day.

- Create A To-Do List - Make sure your desk is stocked with a notepad and pen so that you can keep track of all the tasks you need to complete for the day.
- Keep Your Desk Organized - Having an organized workspace can help to minimize distraction and allow you to stay focused on the task at hand. This makes it easier to keep track of your smaller tasks throughout the day so that you can close out your to-do list with confidence.
- Add A Little Color - Adding a splash of color to your workspace can help to keep your attention focused on the task at hand.
- Use A Timer - Setting a timer for 15 minutes can be a great way to stay focused on a task. This can be helpful when you are tackling a particularly challenging task or working on a project that requires a lot of concentration.
