## Plan your route in advance

The more prepared you are, the less stressed you’ll be. And that’s true for your commute as well. Planning your route in advance will allow you to be more prepared for any traffic issues that could arise. And if you do hit any traffic, you’ll be in a better place to handle it. You might also consider planning when you need to leave for work in advance so that you don’t have to rush. This will allow you to leave with plenty of time to get to work without feeling rushed.

If you’re able to, avoid driving at rush hour. This will allow you to avoid the worst traffic and keep your stress levels low. Keep in mind that you might be able to avoid rush hour by taking public transportation to work.

## Don’t feel obligated to answer work emails or take calls

If you’re commuting to work, you don’t have to feel obligated to answer work-related emails or take calls. If you don’t have time or the bandwidth to take work calls, it’s perfectly fine to tell your coworkers that you’ll return calls later in the day. If you don’t have time to answer emails, you can simply let your coworkers know that you’re backlogged and will get back to them later in the day.

If you commute with a carpool or ride-share, you might want to let your passengers know not to expect you to be answering work-related questions or taking work-related calls. Even if you’re not commuting with a carpool, it’s nice to be courteous to the other passengers and let them know that you’re not available to take calls or respond to emails.

## Try breathing exercises or meditative practices

Breathing exercises and meditation are great for reducing stress. If you have time, try stopping at a quiet place and meditating for a few minutes during your commute. This will allow you to clear your head and make your commute less stressful. Alternatively, you can try breathing exercises. If you’re stuck in traffic, try breathing in and out deeply from your diaphragm. This will help you to relax, even if you’re in a stressful situation.

If you don’t have a lot of time for a full meditation or breathing exercise session during your commute, you can also try a mini version. Try to take a few minutes to focus on your breath at the beginning and/or end of your commute. This will help you to stay present and relaxed throughout your commute.

## Listen to music and/or podcasts

If you love listening to music, try listening to music on your commute instead of podcasts or audio books. The music will help you to stay relaxed and focused, while preventing you from getting distracted. Alternatively, if you’d like to listen to a podcast or an audio book, this will allow you to stay focused as well.

It’s also important to consider the volume level of the music or podcasts you’re listening to. If the volume is too high, it may contribute to distraction and stress. It’s best to keep the volume low enough so that it’s only in the background, but loud enough that you can hear it clearly.

## Bring scented items with you

If you have the option, bringing scented items with you on your commute can help to reduce stress and make your commute more pleasant. Scents such as eucalyptus, lavender, and peppermint are known to help reduce stress and anxiety. You can bring scented oils, candles, or incense to your car if you’re driving. You can also try bringing scented sprays or essential oils in a small spray bottle with you on public transportation.

If you bring an incense or scented candle with you, try to be considerate to others on your commute. Be sure not to light scented candles in areas where they’re prohibited, and try to keep the incense low enough so that it’s not a distraction to other riders.

## Set an intention for your commute

Not only will setting an intention help you to focus and calm down, it will also help you to define what your day will look like and what your intentions are during the day. When you set an intention for your commute, you’re setting your intention for the rest of the day. It’s a great way to set yourself up for success. It’s also a great way to clear your mind before getting to work. Not only will it help you to clear your mind, but it will also help you to get your day off to a great start.

If you want, you can set an intention for the commute itself. This will allow you to focus on the commute and help you to stay calm throughout the commute.

## Get up and move around regularly

It’s important to move around and stretch your legs during your commute. Not only will this help you to stay awake, but it will also help you to reduce stress. You might want to bring along a yoga mat or a blanket to help you stretch out. Stretching regularly during your commute will also help you to stay healthy.

If you have time to spare during your commute and you’re on public transportation, you might also want to try reading a book. Reading a book during your commute can be a great way to pass the time while staying focused and relaxed.

## Don’t forget to eat a healthy breakfast

Finally, don’t forget to eat a healthy breakfast before your commute. This will allow you to stay focused, alert, and relaxed during your commute. Eating a healthy breakfast can also help you to stay healthy and fit. Commuting can be stressful, but by following these tips, you can help to reduce your stress and make your commute less stressful.
