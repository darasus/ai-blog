The rise of big tech has been one of the most transformative forces in the economy in recent years. The likes of Amazon, Google and Facebook have upended traditional businesses and changed the way we live and work.

Now, these companies are increasingly turning their attention to the financial sector. Amazon is already making inroads into banking, while Facebook is looking to launch its own cryptocurrency. Google is also said to be working on a payments platform.

This is just the latest example of how big tech is reshaping the economy. Here are some other ways it is doing so:

1. Disrupting traditional businesses

The rise of big tech has been a major disruptor of traditional businesses. Companies such as Amazon and Uber have upended whole industries by offering new and innovative ways to buy and sell goods and services.

This disruption is only set to continue as big tech companies move into new sectors. For example, Amazon is now looking to shake up the healthcare industry with its new online pharmacy.

2. Creating new markets

Big tech companies are not just disrupting existing markets, they are also creating entirely new ones. The most notable example is the rise of the sharing economy, which has been driven by companies such as Airbnb and Uber.

This new market has created a whole new way for people to earn money and has had a major impact on the traditional hotel and taxi industries.

3. Transforming how we live and work

The rise of big tech has also transformed how we live and work. The most obvious example is the way that we now consume media, which has been totally transformed by the likes of Netflix and Spotify.

But big tech is also changing the way we work, with an increasing number of people now working remotely thanks to companies such as Slack and Zoom.

4. Boosting the economy

The rise of big tech has been a major driver of economic growth in recent years. The sector has created millions of jobs and generated billions in revenue for the economy.

What's more, the impact of big tech is only set to increase in the years ahead as the sector continues to grow.
