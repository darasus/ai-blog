summary: "Most big tech companies are hardware companies that sell their
  products and services directly to consumers, not through wholesalers or
  retailers. That distinguishes them from “old tech” companies such as Intel,
  Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, and Oracle. Big tech is reshaping the

  ventures in a variety of sectors from retail to real estate."
intro: >-
  Today’s big tech companies are reshaping the economy. They are growing
  fast, investing heavily, and creating new markets. And they’re doing it in
  broad sectors of the economy like retail, transportation, real estate, media,
  and financial services. Big tech is increasingly making things go — rather
  than just selling them to consumers. 

  And there’s more to come. The rise of big tech signals a structural shift in the economy that will have lasting consequences for many industries and workers. 

  The term “big tech” usually refers to a group of nine tech companies whose market capitalization exceeds $200 billion or has grown rapidly in recent years: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Netflix, Tesla, Alibaba Group (the parent company of Ali Baba), and Microsoft.

## What is big tech?

For starters, most big tech companies are hardware companies that sell their products and services directly to consumers, not through wholesalers or retailers. That distinguishes them from “old tech” companies such as Intel, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, and Oracle.

These old-school tech companies have stuck with the computer chip as their core product. Big tech companies have diversified into many other products and services.

Some big tech companies are software firms such as Adobe, Autodesk, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday. But the software industry has always been characterized by small companies with high valuations, such as Intuit and Adobe. What’s different today is the large size of today’s big tech firms and their dominance in key sectors of the economy.

## How has big tech made its mark on the economy?

Big tech is reshaping the economy in three ways. First, it is growing fast. By all indications, big tech is experiencing breakneck growth with little or no end in sight. Fast growth creates jobs, boosts R&D spending, and generates profits for shareholders. 

Fast growth also creates problems for society, such as rising income inequality. Finally, it is investing heavily in new business ventures in a variety of sectors from retail to real estate. Second, big tech has made its mark by expanding into sectors of the economy that have often been outside its core competencies and business model. For example, Facebook has moved into financial services by offering a digital money transfer service. And Apple has moved into health care by providing a health app and hosting a electronic health record service. Third, big tech is investing heavily in new business ventures in a variety of sectors from retail to real estate.

## A growing share of GDP and employment

The combined profits of big tech have climbed steadily since 2010. And profits in 2018 are projected to be the highest ever. The combined share of big tech in gross value added (GVA) – a broad measure of output – is growing steadily. In the future these companies could account for a significant share of global GDP. While big tech’s market value is high, its employment is not. Indeed, the number of employees at big tech firms is relatively low, between 50 and 200 thousand.

## A long list of economic winners

Some estimates indicate that big tech has contributed about 4% of GDP growth in recent years. That is not bad for a relatively new group of companies. In addition to the GDP growth, big tech has spawned many other economic winners. Some of the biggest economic winners from big tech are: - Retailers: Big tech has reshaped retailing by building online marketplaces, selling a wide variety of products, and competing directly with traditional retailers. - Digital marketing and advertising: Big tech has transformed digital marketing by creating and hosting ads, selling software for managing ads, and offering data analysis for marketers. - Real estate: Big tech has acquired large tracts of real property for data centers, offices, and other facilities.
- Transportation: Big tech has reshaped the transportation industry with self-driving cars and a variety of logistics services.
- Financial services: Big tech has expanded into financial services and created new markets in online lending, online payments, and digital money transfers.
- Healthcare and health care data: Big tech has moved into health care by providing an ecosystem of health apps and hosting an electronic health record service.
- Health and wellness products: Big tech has reshaped the health and wellness product sector with fitness trackers, virtual reality devices, and other products.
- Healthcare services and devices: Big tech has moved into health services by purchasing hospitals and creating new services like remote surgery.

## A long list of losers

In the process of reshaping the economy, big tech has hurt many sectors of the economy, workers, and consumers. Some of the biggest losers from big tech include: - Retailers: Traditional retailing has been hit hard by Amazon’s expansion, and many retailers have struggled or failed to compete with Amazon. - Digital marketing and advertising: Traditional digital marketing and advertising firms have lost out to new players from big tech. - Real estate: Big tech’s growth has created a shortage of commercial real estate in the U.S. and other countries. - Transportation: Traditional transportation firms have been hit hard by the rise of self-driving cars. - Financial services: Many financial services have been transformed by big tech. - Healthcare and health care data: Health care data has been transformed by the rise of new digital health services. - Healthcare services and devices: Traditional health services have been transformed by big tech’s purchase of hospitals. 

## Big winner: Platform capitalism

Perhaps the biggest winner from today’s big tech is the business model that defines today’s tech giants. We call it platform capitalism. It is an economic model in which a firm uses network effects and data to create an online platform that attracts customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The platform generates profits by selling services or products. It also collects data on participants and uses the data to increase its profits and influence in the economy. The platform is sustained by a two-sided network: users and providers. In the case of the big tech companies, the users are consumers, the providers are businesses or individuals providing data or services, and the network is the internet and mobile devices. Platform capitalism is a hybrid model that combines elements of the manufacturing, service, and information economies.

## Conclusion

Big tech has transformed the economy in less than a decade. These nine companies have grown fast, diversified into other sectors, and invested heavily in new ventures. They have also reshaped the economy by creating new markets and dominating existing ones. And they have benefited from a business model known as platform capitalism.

While these companies have benefited from their success, others have been hurt. The rise of big tech has created winners and losers in the economy.
