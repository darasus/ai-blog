The best part? Juicing is cheap (or free if you grow your own produce), easy and fast. You can make a glass of juice in less than 5 minutes without much prep work involved.\nJuicing also means that you\\u2019ll probably consume more fruits and vegetables than you would in any other form.

If we all stopped eating meat it would have a huge effect on carbon dioxide levels, deforestation rates, and natural water courses.\nAs you\\u2019ll discover from reading this article, veganism could be the answer to climate change; however, there are also some drawbacks.
