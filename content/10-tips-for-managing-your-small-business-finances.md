intro: "Today’s small business owner faces an entirely different set of
  challenges and opportunities than their predecessors did. The Internet, social
  media, and mobile devices have all changed the way that businesses operate and
  compete. Fortunately, these same technological advances have also made it
  easier for businesses to operate on a smaller scale with less capital. Over
  the last few decades, we’ve seen thousands of startups launch new products or
  services with very little upfront costs by incorporating as a small business
  instead of a larger corporation. There are many great benefits to operating
  your business as a Small Business Corporation (S Corp) rather than as a
  regular corporation (C Corp). When you operate your business as an S Corp, you
  can take advantage of what’s known as “pass-through taxation.” A pass-through
  entity is one where shareholders report their shares on their personal tax
  returns rather than the company’s tax return. Here are ten helpful tips to

## Know the difference between an S Corp and a C Corp

The first step in operating your business as an S Corp is to understand the difference between an S Corp and a C Corp. A C Corp is a for-profit corporation that’s formed by filing articles of incorporation and issuing shares to investors. Shareholders in a C Corp receive a W-2 form from the IRS each year and must report their earnings from the corporation on their personal income tax returns. In contrast, an S Corp is a for-profit corporation formed by filing articles of incorporation. Shareholders in an S Corp receive a K-1 form from the IRS each year and report the earnings from this corporation on their personal income tax returns. Another key difference between C Corps and S Corps is that C Corps can have an unlimited number of shareholders while an S Corp must have no more than 100 shareholders.

## Hire a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)

Whether you choose to operate your business as an S Corp or a C Corp, it’s a good idea to hire a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to help you prepare your company’s annual tax return. A CPA will also be able to help you identify any areas in your business where you could be experiencing greater profits or seeing a higher return on the money that you’re currently investing in your company. Additionally, CPAs can help you project your current and expected future cash flow by running financial projections for your business. This can be very beneficial for owners of S Corps who have to manage their company’s finances on a personal basis and report their earnings on their individual income tax return.

## Commit to monthly financial planning

One of the best ways to manage your company’s finances is to commit to regular monthly financial planning. Whether you operate your company as an S Corp or a C Corp, your business’s financial health is largely determined by the decisions that you make on a daily basis. Therefore, it’s important that you take the time to regularly review your company’s financial projections. You can use a spreadsheet or financial software program to project your company’s cash flow, operating expenses, and future capital requirements. This financial planning will help you identify areas in your company where you’re spending too much money and areas that you may be able to cut back on. It will also help you identify areas where you may be able to expand your company’s operations.

## Track your company’s assets

One of the best ways to track your company’s assets is to create a list of every asset (both tangible and intangible) that’s currently in your possession. You can then use this list to track your company’s assets throughout their useful life. This will help you to determine when your company’s assets are no longer useful and should be replaced or retired. Keeping track of your company’s assets can also help you better understand the value of your business. More importantly, it will help you identify the correct amount of money to put down on a business insurance policy. Business insurance covers your company’s assets in the event that they’re destroyed or stolen.

## Track your company’s liability risks

One of the best ways to track your company’s liability risks is to create a list of all of your company’s commitments and obligations. You can then use this list to track all of the money that you owe to your suppliers, employees, contractors, debtors, and other creditors. This will enable you to identify any areas in your company where you’re over-extending yourself. Keeping track of your company’s liabilities will also enable you to identify how much money you’ll need to renew your various insurance policies when they come up for renewal.

## Track your company’s asset risks

One of the best ways to track your company’s asset risks is to create a list of all of your company’s assets and their current replacement costs. This will enable you to keep track of any assets that are becoming obsolete and need to be replaced. You can use this list to track your company’s total asset value. Tracking your company’s total asset value can be helpful when calculating how much money you’ll need to raise in order to launch a new product or service.

## Track your company’s operating expenses

One of the best ways to track your company’s operating expenses is to use a budget spreadsheet. You can track your company’s operating expenses by listing each item that you purchase on a monthly basis and their cost. This will enable you to easily identify areas where you’re spending too much money. It will also help you budget for your monthly operating expenses.

## Be aware of tax deadlines for S Corps and LLCs

S Corps are required to pay taxes on their earnings on a regular basis in the form of quarterly estimated taxes. The first payment for your company’s first quarter is due on April 15th. The second payment for your company’s second quarter is due on July 16th. Your third payment for your third quarter is due on October 16th, and your fourth payment for your fourth quarter is due on January 16th of the following year. Most small businesses operate on a calendar year accounting system. However, businesses with more complex financial needs may find it beneficial to operate on a fiscal year accounting system. Fiscal year accounting systems are often used in large corporations and public companies. The tax deadlines for companies using a fiscal year accounting system are typically determined by the company’s fiscal year, which is the 12-month period that their financial statements cover.

## Conclusion

Managing your small business finances is crucial to the success of your company. It’s important that you understand the differences between an S Corp and a C Corp, hire a CPA, commit to monthly financial planning, track your company’s assets, track your company’s liability risks, track your company’s asset risks, track your company’s operating expenses, and be aware of tax deadlines for S Corps and LLCs.
