This means that it\\u2019s not interpreted in real time, like Python or Ruby, which are two other languages that are commonly used for game development. This makes Go perfect for game development because there is no lag in processing.

Some of the most important ones are:\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Ease of learning - Go has a very straightforward syntax, which makes it easy to understand even for new developers. Since it\\u2019s a compiled language, it\\u2019s not as complicated as other compiled languages like C and C++.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Faster compile times - Compiled languages are compiled because they\\u2019re translated into a set of instructions for the computer\\u2019s processor that are much shorter and simpler than the code written by a human.

Go compiles significantly faster than most other compiled languages.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Excellent concurrency support - The world of game development is increasingly digital, but it\\u2019s also increasingly team-based. This means that many people are working on the same project at the same time. In these situations, it\\u2019s important to know how to properly divide tasks between team members to avoid wasting time.

This is something that most developers know how to do, but it\\u2019s important to keep in mind when deciding between languages.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The community is relatively small - Although we\\u2019ve listed some of Go\\u2019s advantages, it doesn\\u2019t have as many developers as languages like Python or Ruby.

It\\u2019s important to keep this in mind when deciding which language to use.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to learn Go?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to learn a language is to learn by doing. This means that when you start learning a language, you should focus on applying it to real-world situations as soon as possible. You can do this by building your own side project, or by contributing to an open-source project. This will force you to practice and will help you learn faster than if you just read about the language. Also, don\\u2019t forget to practice regularly.
