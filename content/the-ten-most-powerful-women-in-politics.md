summary: Nina Turner is one of the few women of color with a prominent place in
  American politics. She made her reputation as a prominent voice in the 2016
  Democratic Party presidential nomination, where she campaigned for U.S.
  Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT). Since taking office, she has campaigned for
  policies that promote social and economic justice, including a $15 minimum
  wage, affordable health care, and an end to mass incarceration. The list
  includes the first two Muslim women to be elected to the House of
  Representatives in the modern era.
intro: >-
  Women continue to make up a smaller proportion of the overall population
  of politicians. Today, there are only 104 women serving as U.S.
  representatives and senators, which amounts to 19 percent of all legislators
  in the Senate and House of Representatives combined. Women also account for
  just 24 percent of state legislators, 28 percent of city council members, and
  15 percent of mayors. 

  To make matters more challenging, this imbalance is not only apparent but also more pronounced in the political sphere than in any other industry. In business management, for example, women hold almost half (44%) of executive roles . But in government? They account for less than one-fifth (19%) of state legislators, city council members, and mayors combined.

  As a result, when it comes to women in politics we often see a lopsided list that skews toward white cisgender able-bodied wealthy educated privileged women who look very little like the rest of us. And while we’re happy to see these women rising up as leaders within government — they are after all our representatives — we can do better…and we must do better if we want our democracy back from the patriarchy that currently controls it so thoroughly.

Since the 2016 presidential election, the political scene has changed significantly. The pendulum has swung suddenly and sharply in favor of the right, and it is time for us to turn it back again. In order to do that, however, we need to look beyond the white women who currently dominate the list of the most powerful women in the political sphere, and start lifting up those who are more representative of the people they have been elected to represent.

These women have the potential to shift policy, to change the direction of the country, and to make our democracy more representative of the people it was designed to serve. They have the power to put the people first and if we are lucky enough to see them rise to power, we must do everything we can to make sure that they succeed.
