## Lecrae

If you’re looking for a rapper who will make you want to dance, you’ll want to check out Lecrae. Hailing from a Christian household in Southern California, Lecrae has always been open about his faith. Even as a teenager, he was making music that addressed personal issues like his struggles with drugs, his homosexuality, and his relationship with God. But Lecrae didn’t become a household name until he joined the Reach Records team in 2004 and released his first mainstream album, 2005’s Real Talk.
