## Lecrae

If you’re looking for a rapper who will make you want to dance, you’ll want to check out Lecrae. Hailing from a Christian household in Southern California, Lecrae has always been open about his faith. Even as a teenager, he was making music that addressed personal issues like his struggles with drugs, his homosexuality, and his relationship with God. But Lecrae didn’t become a household name until he joined the Reach Records team in 2004 and released his first mainstream album, 2005’s Real Talk.

Though Lecrae has continued to make music that grapples with faith, he has also worked hard to expand his appeal. In recent years, he has experimented with different styles of production, incorporating elements of EDM, trap, and even pop music. In other words, Lecrae is one rapper who will definitely make you want to dance.

## Chance The Rapper

Unlike many of his colleagues, Chance has been open about his Christian faith, his commitment to his family, and his disdain for the flashy side of the music industry. On top of that, he favors a laid-back, jazzy style of hip-hop that is nothing like the trap beats that have come to define the genre in recent years.

Nevertheless, Chance’s music has struck a chord with the public. His 2013 mixtape Acid Rap received wide critical acclaim, and his 2016 album Coloring Book won the Grammy for Best Rap Album.

His first two albums, Camp and Royalty, were relatively low-key affairs, but all that changed in 2013 with the release of the mega-hit album Because the Internet. The album featured a more aggressive style of production and a newfound swagger that helped Glover win a Grammy for Best Rap Album.

The following year, Glover announced that he was retiring his Childish Gambino persona and moving on to other projects.
