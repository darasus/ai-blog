## What is Mediation?

Mediation is a process where a neutral third party helps two parties in conflict come to an agreement about how to resolve their dispute. The mediator does not make any decisions for the parties or impose a solution on them — instead, he or she facilitates communication between the two sides and helps them find their own solution to the problem. Mediation is often cheaper and faster than litigation, and the parties have more control over the outcome. It’s a good option if you have a dispute you want to resolve but don’t want to get lawyers involved.

Mediation is not the same thing as arbitration. In mediation, the mediator does not impose a solution on the parties. Instead, he or she helps the two sides find a solution on their own, based on their interests and needs. In arbitration, the arbitrator makes a decision for the parties based on the law and their interests as stated in their arbitration agreement, and this decision is usually final.

## The History of Mediation

The history of mediation stretches back to ancient times. In fact, this method dates back to the beginning of recorded human history, where it was used to solve disputes between tribes and clans who had no established courts or legal systems.
Mediators have been building trust and finding solutions for centuries — and have been using a wide variety of methods, depending on the needs of the people and the situation. Religion, psychology, and even psychedelic drugs have been used as tools for mediation throughout history.
Mediation as we know it today got its start in Europe in the late 19th century. It started out as a tool for resolving labor disputes, but soon became popular in other areas of dispute resolution as well. A Swiss man named Ferdinand G. Ph. Benoit is often credited as the inventor of modern mediation. He developed a method of mediation called the “benoit method” and published it in a Swiss newspaper article in 1887. He also founded the Société pour l’Arbitrage et la Médiation, the first mediation society in the world.

## Why Is Mediation So Effective?

The effectiveness of mediation lies in its ability to create an environment that is safe and non-threatening for the parties involved in conflict. The mediator is there to assist the parties in expressing themselves and finding common ground.
The mediator does not take sides, does not make decisions for the parties, does not impose solutions on them, and does not judge their interests or positions. Instead, the mediator’s job is to create a relaxed environment where communication can flourish and the parties can explore their options for resolving their dispute. This communication is facilitated by the mediator, who uses a variety of tools, techniques, and skills to make sure the parties feel safe, heard, and able to explore solutions.

## Types of Mediation

There are many different types of mediation processes, each with its own pros and cons. When it comes to resolving conflict in business relationships, mediation is one of the most effective strategies. The type of mediation process you use will depend on the needs and interests of the parties. Here are some common types of mediation processes you may come across:  Traditional mediation. This is the classic mediation process, where the parties sit down with a mediator, who asks them questions, facilitates communication, and guides them in finding a solution. This is a flexible process, but it does depend on the parties being able to communicate directly with each other. Mediational inquiry. This is a type of mediation process that is somewhat similar to a court trial, where an impartial mediator asks the parties questions to determine the facts of the dispute and their interests. The mediator then uses this information to help the parties resolve their dispute. This process is very structured and is often used in legal mediation. Holistic mediation. This is a process that seeks to look at the entire dispute from various angles and on various levels — both the facts of the situation and the interests of the parties. This type of mediation process can explore the broader implications of the dispute for the parties and their relationships.

## Limitations of Mediation

Although mediation is a highly effective dispute resolution process, it does have its limitations. If the parties in a dispute have conflicting interests that they cannot mutually agree on, mediation is not the right process to use.
Mediation works best when the parties are able to express their interests and find solutions that work for them — rather than imposing solutions that one party imposes on the other. In some situations, one party has such a distinct advantage over the other that it is impossible for the disadvantaged party to find a solution that works for them.
Mediation also does not work for situations where one party is able to impose a solution on the other.
