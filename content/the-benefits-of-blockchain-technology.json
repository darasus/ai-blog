It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an earlier version of the blockchain code named \\u201CC Haskell\\u201D and later changed to \\u201CCardano\\u201D. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Because blockchain is widely known as the technology behind Bitcoin, many businesses are hesitant to adopt it because of its association with cryptocurrency. However, that reputation isn\\u2019t necessarily fair. The real risk lies in how companies implement blockchain instead of the technology itself.\nThere are potential risks when adopting new technologies such as blockchain; however, implementing it correctly can help your business thrive by streamlining processes and reducing costs. This article explains the risks of blockchain technology and how you can mitigate them before implementation.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!
