  "intro": "The world is full of digital solutions that solve problems. But few digital solutions are as effective and game-changing as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them. This process eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Blockchain technology also has other benefits, including faster transactions and greater transparency.  Moreover, it has the potential to reshape industries from finance to logistics, healthcare and beyond. The widespread adoption of blockchain represents a major innovation in computer science, with implications for almost every industry sector — including insurance.",
  "content": "## What is Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them.\n\nThe first block in a blockchain consists of a header, a transaction list, and a hash pointer. The header includes information about the block, such as the block’s hash (a unique identifier), the block’s timestamp, and the block’s size. The transaction list includes information about each transaction included in the block, such as the transaction’s hash (a unique identifier), the transaction’s timestamp, the transaction’s type (whether it is a transfer of cryptocurrency or another type of transaction), the transaction’s recipient (the blockchain address of the person or entity that receives the transaction), and the transaction’s amount (the amount transferred). The hash pointer consists of a hash of the previous block’s header.\n\n## How Does Blockchain Work?\n\n- Creating a Block\n\n- Validating a Block\n\n- Mining a Block\n\n- Recording a Block\n\n## Why Is Insurance Interested in Blockchain?\n\n## 3 Ways Blockchain Will Change the Insurance Industry\n- Transparency: Improving Customer Confidence in Insurance\n- Efficiency: Streamlining Operational Processes\n- Risk Management: Utilizing Smart Contracts\n\n## 2.
