But few digital solutions are as effective and game-changing as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them. This process eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Blockchain technology also has other benefits, including faster transactions and greater transparency.  Moreover, it has the potential to reshape industries from finance to logistics, healthcare and beyond.
