intro: >-
  The holidays can bring stress in abundance. There’s shopping, traveling
  and entertaining to consider. And that’s before you even get to the season
  itself. 

  The holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come. 

  Fortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response. So if you want to reduce the stress of this festive time of year, here are five ways you can do so:

## Plan ahead

The best way to reduce stress is to plan ahead. If you know what you have to do and have a plan for when or where you have to do it, you will not have time to worry about it.

In this season, there’s a lot to do. There’s shopping, cooking, decorating, cleaning, and parties to plan. The best way to reduce stress is to make a plan for when you will do all of these things. Write out your schedule and place the tasks you have to do on your schedule. This way, you will know when you have to do things, and if you have a busy schedule, you will know what you have to do each day and won’t have time to worry about how you are going to get everything done because you already have a plan for it.

## Manage your time

Another way to reduce stress during the holiday season is to manage your time. This means setting aside a certain amount of time for each task that you need to accomplish, and then staying focused on that task until it is done.
For example, if you want to bake cookies for the holidays, you might set a timer for 30 minutes. Once that timer goes off, you are done baking. You don’t have to be a baking master to do this. It can apply to everything, including gift buying, decorating, entertaining, or whatever else you need to do.
We may have a lot to do during the holidays, but we have a set amount of time that we have to do it. So if you manage your time, you will know how much time you have to get each task done, and you will not have time to worry about how you are going to get everything done.

## Ask for help

Another way to reduce stress during the holiday season is to ask for help. When you ask for help, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also giving others a chance to help you.
And there are plenty of people around who would love to help you. From your family to your friends, to the people you work with, everyone wants to help and has a lot to offer.
If you are feeling stressed because you are trying to take on too much, ask for help. Tell the people in your life that you need their help. You don’t have to do everything yourself, and there is no shame in letting people help you. This can lighten your load and give you time to focus on the things that matter most to you.

## Stay physically healthy

Another way to reduce stress during the holiday season is to stay physically healthy. This means getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals, and exercising regularly.
If you are tired and hungry, you are more likely to feel stressed. So try to get at least seven hours of sleep each night, eat healthy meals, and exercise regularly.
When you feel healthy, you are less likely to succumb to stress. You have more energy and are less susceptible to illness. You are also more able to focus on the tasks at hand, rather than being distracted by hunger, tiredness, or a need for health care.

## Don’t forget to be grateful

Another way to reduce stress during the holiday season is to be grateful. When we are grateful, we are appreciative of what we have, rather than focused on what we don’t have. When we are grateful, we are happy with what we have, and we don’t feel the need to have more.
When we are grateful, we are less likely to feel stressed. We have less of a need to have more and more to do. We are focused on what we already have and for what it is worth.
So when you are stressed out during the holidays, take a step back and be grateful for what you already have. Think about what you are doing to contribute to others’ lives, and appreciate the roles that each person in your life plays.

## Conclusion

The holidays can be a wonderful time to spend with friends and family. They can also be a very stressful time if you don't take steps to reduce your stress during the holidays. That's why it's important to plan ahead, manage your time, ask for help, stay physically healthy, and remember to be grateful for what you have. These are five ways you can do so.
