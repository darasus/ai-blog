The benefits of regular exercise are well-documented. Exercise can help improve your mood, increase your energy levels, and help you to maintain a healthy weight. It can also reduce your risk of developing chronic health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

If you’re not used to exercising, it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Find an activity that you enjoy. If you’re not enjoying your workout, you’re less likely to stick with it. There are many different types of exercise to choose from, so find one that suits you.

2. Set realistic goals. Don’t try to do too much too soon – start with small goals that you can realistically achieve.

3. Make it a habit. Try to exercise at the same time each day, so that it becomes part of your daily routine.

4. Get a friend involved. Exercising with a friend can make it more enjoyable and help to keep you motivated.

5. Seek professional help. If you’re struggling to get started with exercise, or if you have any health concerns, speak to your GP or a qualified exercise professional who can help you develop a safe and effective exercise plan.
