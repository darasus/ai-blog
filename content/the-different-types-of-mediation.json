It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.\nMediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there\\u2019s no clear right or wrong side or when it\\u2019s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters. Being insecure and accusatory about something as innocent as checking messages isn\\u2019t likely to lead anywhere positive, after all.
