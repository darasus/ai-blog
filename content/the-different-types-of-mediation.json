General mediation can be used in a wide variety of situations, including landlord-tenant disputes, divorces, contract issues, and many other types of disputes. In most cases, general mediation is an appropriate option for parties who want to resolve their dispute without going to court. The mediator is not an advocate or decision-maker, but a neutral third party who facilitates communication between the disputing parties.",
