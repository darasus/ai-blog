Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There\\u2019s shopping, traveling and entertaining to consider. And that\\u2019s before you even get to the season itself.\nThe holiday season is packed with wonderful traditions like parties and family get-togethers. But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response. So if you want to reduce the stress of this festive time of year, here are five ways you can do so:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If not, are you looking for a way to improve? Coming when called is an essential command that most pet owners neglect. When your dog comes when called, it means he will come back to you right away and not run away or chase something else. This will help keep your dog safe, especially if he\\u2019s prone to running away or chasing objects or other animals. It also helps with training and makes everyday interactions much easier than having to constantly chase after your pet.\nBut perhaps the most important reason why you should train your dog to come when called is because it might just save his life one day. In many cases, dogs that run away don\\u2019t get lost, they are just trying to find a way back home. Therefore, knowing how to train your dog to come when called can be the difference between him coming home safe and sound or getting lost forever. And let\\u2019s face it \\u2013 nobody wants that!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
