1. Get up earlier: This may seem like an obvious one, but getting up earlier can really help you make your mornings easier. By getting up earlier, you can give yourself more time to get things done and avoid rushing around.

2. Make a list: Before you go to bed, make a list of everything you need to do in the morning. This will help you stay organized and focused in the morning.

3. Set your alarm: Make sure to set your alarm for a time that will give you enough time to get everything done. This will help you avoid rushing and feeling stressed in the morning.

4. Eat a healthy breakfast: Eating a healthy breakfast will give you energy and help you start your day off right. Avoid sugary cereals and pastries, and opt for something that will fill you up and give you sustained energy.

5. Get moving: Getting some exercise in the morning can help you wake up and feel energized for the day ahead. Even just a short walk around the block can make a big difference.
