summary: Charlie Puth’s album opens with a tropical-inspired track, “Voicenotes”
  The album has a few really good tracks and a few that don’t really work.
  Overall, the album is a pretty average pop effort. If you are a new fan of
  Puth's past work, then you will like this album as well. If Puth were to take
  maybe the best three or four tracks off this album, he would have a really
  solid EP.

## Track-by-Track Review

Puth’s album opens with a tropical-inspired track, “Voicenotes”, which finds Puth using the voicenotes feature on his phone to connect with his fans and tell them about his upcoming album. The song is pretty catchy and has a light, summery vibe to it; however, it is also a fairly generic pop track and doesn’t really say anything new musically or lyrically. The next track is “ If You Leave Me Now”, which features Meghan Trainor. The song is a soft-rock track that has a bit of an acoustic feel to it and tells the story of two people who were once crazy in love but now find themselves at opposite ends of the relationship spectrum. The song is actually a really interesting track, and the blend of Puth’s vocals and Trainor’s harmonies really work.

## The Good

The album really starts to shine when we get to the third track, “ Done for Me”. This track is a tropical pop track with a Tropical House vibe to it that has a lot of Caribbean influences, such as reggae and calypso. The song has a really nice, tropical rhythm that really makes you want to get up and move. The track also features the vocals of Kehlani, who is one of the best new R&B artists out there and has a very distinctive voice. The blend the two voices create is really nice, and the lyrics are pretty catchy as well.

The fourth track is “ Better”, a pop track that features a tropical house intro and a chorus that is reminiscent of a pop-reggae track. The song has a nice bright melody, paired with a nice, subtle tropical influence that makes the track a pretty enjoyable listen. The next track is “ Lost Without You”, which is a soft-rock ballad that features Puth’s vocals over a piano-driven melody. The song is a nice, subtle track that features some nice piano melodies and Puth’s vocals, which are slightly distorted to create a nice pop effect.

## The Bad

While the album has a few good tracks, there are a few tracks that are not so great. The first one is “ If You Leave Me Now”, which is a song that just doesn’t really work. There are a few different reasons for this. The first reason is that the song just doesn’t fit in with the rest of the album very well. The track is a soft rock ballad that is reminiscent of Imagine Dragons; however, it doesn’t really fit in with the rest of the album, which is a pop album.

The second reason the track doesn’t work is that although the song is supposed to be about two people who are in a relationship and are unsure about it, the song is really slow and the melody doesn’t really have any feeling to it. There are no up-tempo moments or climax in the song; it is just really slow the whole way through.

## Final Words

Charlie Puth’s “Voicenotes” is a solid effort. The album has a few really good tracks and a few that don’t really work. If Puth were to take maybe the best three or four tracks off this album, he would have a really solid EP. Overall, the album is a pretty average pop effort. It’s not bad, but it’s nothing special either. If you are a fan of Puth’s past work, then you will like this album as well. However, if you are a new fan, then you will probably want to listen to some of his older stuff before diving into this album.
