intro: >-
  Charlie Puth has been on a roll lately, with three top 40 hits in the
  last two years. He’s also worked with some pretty big names (including one
  we’ll get to shortly). Now, he’s back with another new album, titled
  “Voicenotes.” It’s a solid effort that shows growth and maturity, as well as
  keeping Puth’s fun and lighthearted style. 

  At its core, Voicenotes is an acoustic pop album. However, it goes deeper than just putting electric guitars aside; these songs are stripped right down to the bare bones. There’s still plenty of production value—especially on the third track—but it feels like Puth made a conscious decision not to hide behind anything.

## Worth mentioning

- “Bad for Me” and “How Long” are two songs that Puth released in the lead up to the album, and they are both very strong tracks. Bad for Me is a bassy and groovy pop song with a killer chorus and great rhythm, while How Long is more of a ballad with a very Puth-ian piano. Both are a great taste of the album, and they are already off to a great start.

- Puth has said that the title track, Voicenotes, is “inspired by what [he] went through,” and that “the emotions and the feelings” were his inspiration. “It’s about making a change in your life. You’ve got to change the way you look at things,” and he truly manages to create an uplifting and inspiring track.

- Puth also teamed up with frequent collaborator Shawn Mendes for a song called “Change My Life.” It’s a very catchy, bouncy pop song, and it’s one of the strongest tracks on the album.

## Charlie Puth’s growth as an artist

Puth has proven that he’s not just a one-hit wonder, and that’s always a good sign. Though he’s stayed in a similar genre, and some of the songs have a similar feel, he’s experimented with new sounds and new styles, while still keeping his sound. There are still strong pop hooks throughout all of these songs, but he’s exploring different textures and different feels. He’s growing as an artist, and it’s a really nice progression to see.

Puth also seems to be growing as a songwriter. These songs are less endearing and more mature than those on his previous two albums. The lyrics of Voicenotes are a bit darker, and they’re more real. You can feel the emotion behind each song, and it feels like Puth has really put himself out there.

## Voice Notes: Title track and lead single

Voicenotes is the first track on the album, and it is a beautiful and breathy acoustic pop song. Puth’s voice is particularly strong here, and the chorus is an absolute banger. The lyrics are contemplative and are reminiscent of an adult journal or a letter to someone close to the writer. Puth has said that the song is intended to be a love song, and that it was written while he was in a relationship. It’s a very personal song, and it’s a great way to kick off the album.

The lead single off of the album, “Short Hair,” is a very catchy and fun pop track. It’s a bit more upbeat than many of the songs on the album, and it’s a great choice for a lead single. It’s a very lighthearted and fun track that is also very catchy, and it’s a great introduction to Puth’s latest album.

## Nine Track Mind

“Nine Track Mind” is the seventh track off of Voicenotes. It is a laid-back, chilled-out pop track with a dreamy soundscape. It has a very laid-back rhythm and texture, and Puth’s breathy vocals fit perfectly with the song. The chorus is dreamy and gorgeous, and it is one of my favorite tracks off of the album.

The title and chorus make a play on the “8-track” sound system that was popular in the 70s and 80s, while Puth’s voice and tone are perfect for this laid-back and dreamy track. It’s a very chilled-out song, and it’s a great track to relax to.

## Change My Life (ft. Shawn Mendes)

“Change My Life” is the 14th track on the album. It is a very catchy, upbeat track, with a light and airy tone. Despite the fact that it has a light tone, the track is very deep and meaningful, with Puth and Mendes singing about finding someone who can save them. It’s a very sweet, meaningful track, and it’s another one of my favorites on the album.

The track is a very strong collaboration, and it’s a great track that shows two artists who are both on their way to becoming superstars. It’s a very catchy and lighthearted track, and it’s perfect for a sunny day.

## Mood Music (ft. Hailee Steinfeld)

“Mood Music” is the 25th track on the album. It is a very dark and moody track with a very unique soundscape, and it is a very interesting track. It’s a bit more experimental, and it’s a very different sound from most of the rest of the album. It’s a very different track, and it’s one that I personally love.

It’s another track that feels very real, and it’s a very interesting track that’s worth listening to even if you don’t usually go for this type of music. The chemistry and dynamic between Steinfeld and Puth is really interesting, and this track is a great example of the two of them working together.

## Fool’s Gold

“Fool’s Gold” is the 37th track on the album. It’s a very smooth and groovy track, and it has a very 70s/80s pop sound, with a great bass and some fantastic percussion. It has a bit of a darker tone, but it’s still a very light track, and it’s very easy to listen to.

This is another track that I really like, and it’s a great way to end the album. It has great production and is a very smooth track with some fantastic instrumentation. It’s a very catchy and smooth track, and it’s a great track to end the album with.

## Wrapping up

At the end of the day, Voicenotes is a very solid album. It’s not quite a perfect album, but it’s a great effort. Puth has shown growth as a songwriter, has shown creativity, and has proven that he is more than a one-hit wonder. Voicenotes is an acoustic pop album that is going to be a great addition to any playlist.
