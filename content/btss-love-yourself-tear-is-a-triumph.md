  has always been the strong point of the group but on “Tear’, he shines even

  digested the EP."
intro: >-
  In a world where every band is a boy band, BTS stands out. The Korean
  sextet has made a name for itself as not just another boy band but one that
  plays its own instruments and has choreographed dance routines that are so
  intricate they sometimes require special stage lighting.

  Armed with these weapons, BTS has twice cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart with its Love Yourself series. And the latest installment of this series — which doubles as its sixth EP — is no exception.

  Furthermore, it’s the strongest of the bunch.

  It’s impossible to talk about BTS without mentioning their massive following beyond Korea: Vivid, obsessive ARMYs (as they call them) who follow their every move and buy everything associated with them. This is why many people assume they are only famous because of social media and pandering ads (which is true). However, anyone who listens to their music will tell you that they deserve all this success. “Love Yourself: Tear” proves it once again.

## The Importance of ‘Tear’

There are two songs on “Tear” that are called “Fake Love” and “Tear.” The connection between these two songs is not accidental: The tear is a sign of strength rather than weakness. As BTS lead vocalist Kim Nam-joon, known as RM, said in an interview with Billboard, “The difference between ‘Fake Love’ and ‘Tear’ is that in ‘Fake Love’, there was a lot of blame, there was a lot of ‘you did this wrong’, and ‘you did this wrong’. Whereas ‘Tear’ is really accepting the fact that it’s all your fault, and you have to go through it.”

## Prologue: Remember Yourself

The first track on the EP — “Euphoria” — is a prelude to the rest of the album. It’s a brief, one-minute and 33-second-long jumble of sounds that act as a reminder of who BTS are and what first connected them to their fans.
Dance breakers may enjoy this track the most because it’s a full-on mix of mechanically programmed sounds and rhythmic beats that are somewhat reminiscent of the ‘90s.
It’s like a trip down memory lane for fans who remember the band’s roots. It’s like BTS is saying “Remember who we are? This is who we are.”

## Tear and the Importance of Vocals in K-pop

The K-pop industry is primarily known for its dance routines and catchy hooks. “Love Yourself: Tear” is a reminder to K-pop fans that vocals can be just as important as dance moves.
RM’s vocals on “Fake Love” are some of his strongest to date. He sings in both Korean and English throughout the track.
BTS’s main vocalist, Kim Nam-joon, or RM, has always been the strong point of the group but on “Tear”, he shines even brighter.
Namjoon sings with a certain amount of controlled emotion in both Korean and English on “Tear”.

## The Darker Side of Love

The next two tracks — “Suga” and “Seesaw” — illustrate the darker side of love. They’re the type of tracks that listeners might not pick up on their first few listens but will appreciate once they’ve fully digested the EP. These tracks are less obvious than “Fake Love” and “Tear”. They aren’t supposed to be obvious; they’re supposed to be subtle and immersive.

These two tracks are BTS’s way of saying that love isn’t all hearts and flowers. There are thorns and thistles that come from it, too.
These tracks prove that BTS isn’t here for the sweet, saccharine love everyone talks about. They’re here for the more realistic and often more complicated side of love.

## BTS’s Vocals Are On Point in ‘Tear’

If there was ever a time to be a BTS fan and a K-pop listener, it’s now. “Love Yourself: Tear” is a reminder that BTS is an actual band with real instruments and not just a group of people who dance and sing in unison.
The drums, guitars, and pianos in these tracks are almost as important as the vocals. They aren’t just pretty pieces of music; they have a purpose.
And BTS’s use of instruments and vocals all come together to create a masterpiece.

## Conclusion

What makes BTS’s “Love Yourself: Tear” so special is that it proves the band isn’t here to pander to their fans. They’re not going to spit out songs about falling in love, being in love, and being heartbroken. They’re here to make music that reflects their lives and how they feel about the world around them.

BTS writes songs about the struggles that younger people face today. They write about growing pains, the pressures of university life, the difficulty of being in a relationship, and the difficulty of being alone. They write about the darker side of love — the side that isn’t all hearts and flowers. END
