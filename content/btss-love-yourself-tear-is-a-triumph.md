summary: A lot of the Love Yourself series has focused on the idea of falling in
  love with yourself and the beauty within each person. Lyrics about learning to
  love yourself no matter what, about not needing anyone else’s approval to feel
  good about yourself and about finding confidence in yourself. BTS have
  referred to their past struggles with self-confidence, but now they’re
  confident in their abilities. The new confidence has led to some really odd
  and silly outfits, hairstyles and lyrics that make no sense whatsoever.
intro: >-
  BTS’s second album of this Love Yourself series is a triumph. It’s the
  sound of seven young men pushing themselves to their limits, both vocally and
  musically, to produce something raw and experimental yet also accessible and
  highly listenable.

  The lead single “Fake Love” has a brilliant music video that is simultaneously disturbing, weird, funny and beautiful. It’s a very interesting song that has some fascinating elements — most notably, the spoken word part that one can easily imagine being recited in an audition for The Bachelor or some similar reality show.

  This album highlights the vocal strength of each member of BTS, who are now all equally comfortable singing ballads as fast-paced dance tracks. Their vocal abilities are contrasted with a range of musical styles from trap to EDM to psychedelic rock to country, all tied together with lyrics about love and self-love in their own unique way.

## Lyrics About Self-Love and Confidence

A lot of the Love Yourself series has focused on the idea of falling in love with yourself and the beauty within each person, and this album is no exception. There are lyrics about learning to love yourself no matter what, about not needing anyone else’s approval to feel good about yourself and about finding confidence in yourself.
In “FAKE LOVE”, BTS ask themselves how to “heal the scars from the wounds that [they] don’t know [they] have” and “speak up” to say “I love myself.”
In “I’m Fine”, BTS sing about “healing the scars” of their past and finding confidence in themselves. “I’m Fine” also has a spoken word part that the members say in English about how they used to hate themselves and their voices, but now they’re confident in their abilities.

## Confidence Is A Double-Edged Sword

In the music business, it’s incredibly common for performers to hate themselves and their bodies. Being comfortable in your skin is essential to being a great singer, but it’s also essential to being a happy human being.
BTS have referred to their past struggles with self-confidence. On their last album, they sang about struggling with their voices, with their bodies, with their self-esteem and with their mental health.
That was last year. This year, they’ve talked about how they’ve learned to love themselves and to be confident in their abilities.
That confidence is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, it’s great that they’ve found the confidence to sing, to dance and to be themselves.
On the other hand, this new confidence has led to some really odd and silly outfits, hairstyles and lyrics that make no sense whatsoever.

## “Fake Love” and Tear-Dropping Vibes

“Fake Love” has an interesting combination of tear-dropping and aggressive vibes. The song begins with the members singing gently about needing to be loved and needing to be accepted, with a beautiful instrumental behind them.
Then, about halfway through the track, it drops into a trap instrumental with aggressive lyrics about battling and fighting.
The song ends again with tear-dropping lyrics about needing love and acceptance.

The song’s music video is a confusing but wonderful trip, with a dancing squid, a man turning into a car, BTS members falling apart, a terrifying dancing bear, a bizarre symbol and lots of other oddities. It’s a very strange but meaningful video.
Parts of the video are tear-inducing, while others are laugh-inducing. It’s a strange mix, but somehow it works.

## The Danger of Loving Someone Who Doesn’t Love Themselves

Unfortunately, the world is full of people who don’t love themselves — people who don’t appreciate their own beauty and don’t feel good about themselves.
There are also people who don’t love the people around them, who don’t appreciate the people who love them and who don’t feel good about the people who love them.
It’s incredibly difficult to love someone who doesn’t love themselves. It’s exhausting. You put all this love into them, and it just gets sucked out and thrown back at you.
Whatever you do for that person, you’re just making them resent you. You can’t love someone into loving themselves.
You can only love them until they’re ready.
When they’re ready, they’ll love themselves. Until then, you have to be patient and wait. You have to love yourself, too.

## An Electronic Dance Music Track That Makes You Want to Move

On this track, BTS members rap and sing about having been cheated by love and wanting to be their best selves. Their lyrics encourage their listeners to love themselves and to find their true selves.
There’s a lot of repetition and a lot of EDM beats in this song. It’s mostly about finding your true self and wanting to just dance and move and be yourself.
This is a really fun track that’s pretty silly, but it’s a really fun, silly song that makes you want to move.

## Conclusion

BTS’s second Love Yourself album is a triumph. It’s the sound of seven young men pushing themselves to their limits, both vocally and musically, to produce something raw and experimental yet also accessible and highly listenable.
This album highlights the vocal strength of each member of BTS, who are now all equally comfortable singing ballads as fast-paced dance tracks. Their vocal abilities are contrasted with a range of musical styles from trap to EDM to psychedelic rock to country, all tied together with lyrics about love and self-love in their own unique way.
