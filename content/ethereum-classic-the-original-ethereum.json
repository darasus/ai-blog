After a hack occurred on the Ethereum network, a majority of ETH holders decided to \\u201Chard fork\\u201D the blockchain to reverse the theft, and create a new Ethereum network. ETH holders who didn\\u2019t agree with the decision ended up with two sets of coins: the original set on the old chain, and the new set on the new chain. The old chain was then rebranded to Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market today, with a market cap of almost $6 billion. It\\u2019s the world\\u2019s 14th most valuable digital asset, and the original Ethereum network.\nEthereum Classic has the same functionality as Ethereum, but it\\u2019s code is not as advanced or optimized. It operates on a different consensus mechanism (which is explained below) and it has some bugs that were resolved in Ethereum. However, it is an excellent choice for investors who agree with the initial Ethereum developers\\u2019 decision to reverse the DAO hack.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The DAO Incident and Aftermath\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`As mentioned above, the Ethereum network was compromised in June 2016 by a hacker who exploited a weakness in the DAO program. The attacker managed to steal $50 million in Ethereum, which was around $30 million at the time of the hack. After the incident, the community was divided into two camps: Those who wanted Ethereum to \\u201Chard fork\\u201D in order to undo the hack, and those who opposed the decision and wanted the blockchain to remain as it was. The latter group continued using the original Ethereum code as it was before the hack, and referred to it as Ethereum Classic.\nThe reason for the fork was that the stolen Ethereum couldn\\u2019t be retrieved from the hacker\\u2019s address, and would therefore be lost forever. Opponents of the fork believed that Ethereum should remain as it was and that the hacker should keep the money. They didn\\u2019t want to change the original blockchain because such an action would be a violation of blockchain principles. They wanted to maintain the original state of Ethereum and let the hacker keep the money.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Was Ethereum Classic Created?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The debate between ETH and ETC supporters raged on for months. Eventually, the decision was made to activate the Ethereum network hard fork, which would allow all ETH holders to withdraw their stolen funds, plus a 25% extra. However, the hard fork also meant that the original Ethereum blockchain would be altered and the \\u201Ccode is law\\u201D principle would be broken. As mentioned above, ETC supporters didn\\u2019t want to change the original Ethereum blockchain. Their primary goal was to create a network that was identical to the original Ethereum, but without any possible interference from ETH.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Since the hard fork was a permanent solution, supporters of the classic chain decided to continue operating the original Ethereum network and to let the hacker keep the stolen money.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Buy Ethereum Classic?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"First, it\\u2019s important to note that Ethereum Classic isn\\u2019t listed on every single crypto exchange. In fact, it\\u2019s only available on a handful of trading platforms. However, you can easily buy ETC using the top 3 exchanges below. Once you\\u2019ve selected an exchange, create an account and make sure to review their trade fees, deposit and withdrawal limits, and other obligatory details. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before you can purchase any Ethereum Classic, you will need to buy Bitcoins or Ether first. You can do this by signing up for an account at Coinbase. Coinbase is currently the most popular and reputable place to buy ETH. Once you\\u2019ve created an account, connect your payment method (i.e. bank account or credit card) and buy as much Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) as you want. If you buy less than $100 worth of coins, you won\\u2019t pay any fees.

From cyber threats to AI, there is no end to the stream of new technologies. As a result, businesses need to stay ahead of the curve by identifying which innovations could have a positive impact on their business, and how they can leverage them to optimise operations and drive value.\nWith so many emerging technologies, it can be challenging for businesses to know where best to focus their innovation efforts. Fortunately, there are plenty of potential areas for innovation that have the potential to have an impact on your business. After exploring several emerging technology trends and reviewing numerous outside sources, we found that blockchain technology stands out as one of the most promising innovations for businesses in almost any industry.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary. In this article, you\\u2019ll learn more about what Ethereum is and its unique benefits as well as potential challenges it faces going forward in adoption and development.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
