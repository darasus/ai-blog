The latter group continued using the original Ethereum code as it was before the hack, and referred to it as Ethereum Classic.\nThe reason for the fork was that the stolen Ethereum couldn\\u2019t be retrieved from the hacker\\u2019s address, and would therefore be lost forever. Opponents of the fork believed that Ethereum should remain as it was and that the hacker should keep the money.

The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary.
