ETH holders who didn\\u2019t agree with the decision ended up with two sets of coins: the original set on the old chain, and the new set on the new chain. The old chain was then rebranded to Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market today, with a market cap of almost $6 billion. It\\u2019s the world\\u2019s 14th most valuable digital asset, and the original Ethereum network.\nEthereum Classic has the same functionality as Ethereum, but it\\u2019s code is not as advanced or optimized.

After the incident, the community was divided into two camps: Those who wanted Ethereum to \\u201Chard fork\\u201D in order to undo the hack, and those who opposed the decision and wanted the blockchain to remain as it was. The latter group continued using the original Ethereum code as it was before the hack, and referred to it as Ethereum Classic.\nThe reason for the fork was that the stolen Ethereum couldn\\u2019t be retrieved from the hacker\\u2019s address, and would therefore be lost forever. Opponents of the fork believed that Ethereum should remain as it was and that the hacker should keep the money. They didn\\u2019t want to change the original blockchain because such an action would be a violation of blockchain principles. They wanted to maintain the original state of Ethereum and let the hacker keep the money.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Was Ethereum Classic Created?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The debate between ETH and ETC supporters raged on for months. Eventually, the decision was made to activate the Ethereum network hard fork, which would allow all ETH holders to withdraw their stolen funds, plus a 25% extra. However, the hard fork also meant that the original Ethereum blockchain would be altered and the \\u201Ccode is law\\u201D principle would be broken. As mentioned above, ETC supporters didn\\u2019t want to change the original Ethereum blockchain. Their primary goal was to create a network that was identical to the original Ethereum, but without any possible interference from ETH.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Since the hard fork was a permanent solution, supporters of the classic chain decided to continue operating the original Ethereum network and to let the hacker keep the stolen money.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Buy Ethereum Classic?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"First, it\\u2019s important to note that Ethereum Classic isn\\u2019t listed on every single crypto exchange. In fact, it\\u2019s only available on a handful of trading platforms. However, you can easily buy ETC using the top 3 exchanges below. Once you\\u2019ve selected an exchange, create an account and make sure to review their trade fees, deposit and withdrawal limits, and other obligatory details. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before you can purchase any Ethereum Classic, you will need to buy Bitcoins or Ether first. You can do this by signing up for an account at Coinbase. Coinbase is currently the most popular and reputable place to buy ETH. Once you\\u2019ve created an account, connect your payment method (i.e. bank account or credit card) and buy as much Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) as you want. If you buy less than $100 worth of coins, you won\\u2019t pay any fees.
