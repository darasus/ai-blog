In fact, the organic food market is growing faster than any other segment of the food industry. According to the Organic Trade Association, sales of organic foods increased by almost 10% in 2017 alone. And given that more and more consumers are becoming aware of what they\\u2019re eating and where it comes from, that isn\\u2019t going to change anytime soon. Which begs the question: Are all those new organic options worth it? Do they really taste better than conventional alternatives? Are they healthier for you? And most importantly, is the cost worth it?\nIf you read through all the information on different types of organic foods and their benefits, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed right now. That\\u2019s totally normal!
