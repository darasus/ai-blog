summary: We're obsessed with fame, and that shapes everything in our lives. We
  pay attention to celebrities even when we don’t realize we’re doing it.
  Celebrities have always been important, but never before have they held so
  much power. Musicians are the most powerful people in the world, even though
  they're not a political or economic force. Actors are just slightly less
  important than musicians, but the power of actresses is growing rapidly. The
  most famous actors are also the best actors, but are not the best actresses.
intro: >-
  You probably think the world is run by politicians, businesses, and
  technology companies. You’d be right—but you’d also be missing the most
  important people. Because while those other people are all important, the real
  rulers of this world are much more human: They’re celebrities. 

  The way we see the world has changed dramatically over the past few decades. In part because of social media, but mostly because of the rise of celebrities as a fixture in our lives, almost every aspect of life has been reframed by who is watching. It used to be that if you wanted to become famous, you had to have something worth saying or do something exciting enough to get on TV. 

  Now all you need is a million followers on Instagram and a sex tape with another famous person. It’s more than just a silly trend—it reveals something fundamental about how we now see the world.

## By the numbers: How Celebrities Rule the World

Celebrities are everywhere in our lives. They’re on our phones, on our TV screens, and even in our news feeds. What’s more, people pay more attention to the celebrities than ever.
In 2012, the New York Times published an article about how researchers have found that we pay attention to celebrities even when we don’t realize we’re doing it. If you’ve ever seen someone on their phone and wondered why they’re not paying attention to you, it’s because they’re probably looking at a picture of Kylie Jenner.
With all this in mind, let’s look at how much celebrities rule the world by the numbers.

## We’re obsessed with fame, and that shapes everything

The first thing to understand about why celebrities rule the world is that we’re incredibly obsessed with fame. Celebrities are famous, but we’re not obsessed with them the way we used to be. Celebrities used to be people whose job was to be famous. We’re obsessed with the idea of fame, not the people who are famous for being famous. We’re obsessed with the idea of being famous, being Instagram famous, or being Snapchat famous. We’re obsessed with people knowing our names and recognizing our faces.
We’re obsessed with fame because it’s a quality that is easy to understand. Fame is something you can quantify and measure. The most important things in our world are difficult to understand and often intangible. 
The economy, climate change, and the war in Syria are all massively important things, but because they’re complicated and difficult to understand, we tend to ignore them. When you compare that to how much we obsess over fame, it’s clear how important it is to us.

## A brief history of celebrity obsession

The obsession with fame has been around as long as people have been able to read and write. The earliest celebrities were people like politicians, explorers, and artists who were admired for their work. But the earliest example of outside attention paid to celebrities is gossip magazines.
The first gossip magazine, Town Topics, was published in New York City in the 1890s. Since then, the media has played an enormous role in shaping who we spend our time thinking about and who we build into celebrities.
The rise of the internet created a whole new world of celebrity obsession, but social media has taken things even further. Celebrities have always been important, but never before have they held so much power.

## Musicians are the most powerful people in the world

Musicians are the most powerful people in the world, even though they’re not a political or economic force. What musicians have is influence. If a musician posts about an issue that’s important to them, millions of people will hear about it and thousands will join them. A politician can post about an important issue and maybe a few thousand people will hear about it. The thing is, though, that politicians have a lot more power. They can pass laws, they can fund new programs, they are in charge of entire countries. But they don’t have the same level of influence as musicians.
Musicians don’t just have influence over the issues they talk about. They have influence over how we see the world. When a musician posts a picture of their cat, it gets just as many likes as a post about something they think is important.
The most important people in the world are the people who have the most influence on your life. Musicians have a lot of influence, and that makes them the most important people in the world.

## Actors are just slightly less important than musicians

Actors are just slightly less important than musicians. They have a lot of influence over culture, but not as much influence over issues as musicians do.
Actors are the most visible people on the planet. We recognize their faces and know their names. We’re surrounded by them and their work. They’re people like Leonardo DiCaprio, Emma Watson, and Tom Cruise.
And when a celebrity like that talks about something, we listen—not just because they’re famous, but because they’re incredibly talented as well. The most famous actors are also the best actors.

## The power of actresses is rapidly growing

The power of actresses is rapidly growing in the world. It used to be that only a small number of actresses would be famous in any given decade.
For example, in the ‘80s, there were only three women who were famous enough to be recognized by most people: Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, and Oprah Winfrey.
The ‘90s were a similar story, with only Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster, and maybe Meg Ryan or Drew Barrymore. But since the turn of the century, actresses have exploded in number. Just look at the women who have been nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars in the past few years: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, and Reese Witherspoon.
Caitlin Flanagan, writing for the Atlantic, calls this the Age of the Actress. “It’s not just that actresses are playing more important roles,” she writes. “It’s that they’re becoming the main characters in their own stories.”

## The biggest takeaway

Celebrities are the most important people in the world. Other people have more power, but celebrities have more influence. They are the most visible people in the world, and the most audible. They have more power than the president, more influence than Wall Street, and more fame than the internet. Whoever controls the world has to work with the celebrities of the world.

And if we want to understand what’s going on in the world, we need to understand that fame is more important than ever.
