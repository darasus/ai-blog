intro: >-
  Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that launched in 2014. Similar
  to Bitcoin, it is a decentralized digital currency with anonymous users and
  transactions. But that’s where the similarities end. 

  Monero has one of the largest communities of any cryptocurrency project, with over 16,000 active members on its forum and over 2,000 subscribers on its main Reddit page. These users are not just passive observers; they drive the future development of Monero by voicing their opinions and giving input on new ideas or potential changes to existing ones. This article takes into account all these aspects when explaining why you should consider investing in Monero.

## Monero is digital cash

Monero is designed to be like digital cash by enabling direct person-to-person transactions. With only two parties involved in the transaction, there is no way for a third party (including government agencies) to track the money.
These attributes make it useful for many situations. For example, if a person is travelling to a country where the local currency is often used for money laundering, they can convert their cash into Monero to avoid being caught in that net. But that’s not all. You could also use it to buy items online without letting the seller know your real identity, or pay employees without having to report the transaction to the government. Not to mention, it is also a great way for people living under oppressive regimes to escape the government’s ever-watchful eye.

## Anonymous transactions

The privacy features of Monero make it very easy to send and receive money anonymously. You can convert your regular money into Monero (and vice versa) by using an exchange that supports Monero.
There are many different exchanges to choose from, but most exchanges will require you to provide your full name and identity. By using an exchange that supports Monero, you are sending your transaction through an anonymizing network called the “Hidden Service Protocol”. This network is decentralized and does not require any server or host. Instead, it is routed through the computers of other users on the network.
When you send a transaction through this network, the IP address of the computers using the network is hidden. This means that other people cannot see your computer’s IP address and they cannot see who is using the network. The only thing they can see is the IP address of the other computer on the network.
Since the IP address of the computer you’re using is hidden, it is hard to track and there is no way to know who is using that computer.

## What makes Monero unique?

The Monero development team has been regularly releasing updates to improve and enhance the technology’s security, usability and accessibility.
In fact, the latest version, which was released in October 2018, included the following updates:
- Better and more secure wallet: the developers have implemented a new decentralized network for the wallet, which means that the wallet is fully decentralized and does not require a central server to operate. This wallet will become the new standard for the Monero protocol.
- Improved scalability: the new update boasts a significant improvement in the number of transactions per second. The new system includes several measures that increase the speed of transactions.
- The new Ring CT implementation: this is the core privacy feature that makes Monero special. It hides the quantity and the sender of the transaction.

## Why should you invest in Monero?

There are many benefits to using Monero, both as a user and as an investor. Here are a few of the main reasons to consider investing in Monero:
- Monero is a decentralized network that is not controlled by any government or company. This means that it can’t be shut down by any authority, and there is no centralized organization that can change or impact the technology.
- Monero is fungible, which means that each unit is worth the same as any other unit of the same type. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, one Monero coin is indistinguishable from another Monero coin. This is significant for merchants who are concerned about “blacklisted” coins and who want to avoid accepting tainted money.
- It is a scalable network, meaning that it can process a high number of transactions per second and can easily handle an influx of new users.
- It has a large and active community that is focused on providing constructive feedback and suggestions for ways to improve the technology.
- It has a high level of liquidity, meaning that it is easy to find buyers or sellers. This is important because it makes it easier to convert to or from other currencies.

## The future of Monero

The technology behind Monero is still new, and there are a few changes that are expected in the future:
- The implementation of Ring CT: as mentioned above, this is the core privacy feature that makes Monero special. It hides the quantity and the sender of the transaction. This system was supposed to be implemented in September 2018, but the development team decided to delay it because they wanted to make it even more secure.
- The addition of confidential transactions: confidential transactions are the next feature expected to be implemented in Monero. This feature will hide the amount of the transaction.
- The Monero team expects to see more partnerships and integrations with other companies and payment networks by 2020.
- The Monero team has also set a goal of achieving a $1 billion market cap by 2020.

## The risk of investing in Monero

All investment comes with a risk, and cryptocurrency is no exception. However, the risk of investing in Monero is relatively low compared to other cryptocurrencies. Here are a few potential risks:
- The biggest risk when investing in Monero is that it doesn’t become more widely adopted and used. If people don’t know that it exists, they can’t use it. This means that it will have a hard time increasing its value.
- Another risk is that it is hard to know what will happen to the value of Monero in the short term. Although it is expected to increase in value over the long term, nobody can say what the value will be in a month or a year.
- Finally, there is always a risk that the government may take action against Monero. Although the technology is designed to be as anonymous as possible, governments can take action against any technology they feel threatens their power.

## Summing up

Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that boasts a high level of scalability, fungibility, and decentralization. It is designed to be like digital cash by enabling direct person-to-person transactions. The technology behind Monero is still new, and there are a few changes that are expected in the future. There are a few risks associated with investing in Monero, but they are relatively low when compared to other cryptocurrencies. By 2020, the Monero team expects to see more partnerships and integrations with other companies and payment networks. By that time, it is possible that the value of Monero will have significantly increased.
