summary: JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the
  world. It’s a core language used by websites and apps. You can use it to build
  websites, automate tasks, create apps, and more. JavaScript is a programming
  language that can be used anywhere, on any device, and in any programming
  environment. It's like a bookmark that you can use to keep track of important
  information without having to change the actual text itself. The next time you
  use a variable, it will hold a different piece of information.
intro: >-
  Today, most developers use multiple programming languages for different
  projects and purposes. And with new technologies emerging almost every day,
  developers need to stay on top of their game to remain relevant in their
  field.

  And that’s why learning multiple programming languages is so important. No matter what your specialty is or what type of software you want to build as a career, knowing more than one programming language will help you see things from different perspectives, recognize patterns, and solve problems more efficiently.

  In this blog post, we’ll take a look at 7 JavaScript basics that every TypeScript developer should know. By the end of this post, you’ll have gained a solid foundation in several key areas of TypeScript development and be ready to dive deeper into it.

## Introduction to JavaScript

If you’ve ever programmed online, you’ve probably used JavaScript. It’s one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it’s a core language used by websites and apps.
The popularity of JavaScript comes from the fact that it can be used pretty much anywhere, on any device, and in any programming environment. You can use it to build websites, automate tasks, create apps, and more.
In the early days, JavaScript was used primarily for front-end design – the visuals and user interface of a website. Now, however, it’s used for much more than that.

## Variables

In programming, a variable is a placeholder that stores information that can change over time. This could be a number, a letter, a word, or any combination of symbols.
It’s important to understand that the information stored in a variable will change over time. Every time you use the variable, it will hold a different piece of information. The next time you use it, the information will be different again.
You can use variables to store information that you’ll use regularly, like a person’s name or a price. You can also use them to store information that will change, like the current date or the amount of sales you make each day.

## Constants

A constant is very similar to a variable in that you can use it to store information. The difference is that once you’ve stored data in a constant, that information won’t change. It’s like a bookmark that you can use to keep track of important information without having to change the actual text itself.
You might use a constant to store a mathematical formula so you can use it over and over again. Or you could use it to store information that never changes, like the title of your project or the name of your company.
You can write constants using uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, or a combination of these. Be sure to put each constant on a new line so that it’s easier to read and understand.

## Strings

A string is a group of characters that you group together to form a single unit. These characters can be letters, numbers, symbols, and other characters.
You might use a string to group together several letters, like your first and last name, to form your full name.
You can create strings anywhere in your code and use them to store and display text. Strings are very useful for storing anything that you might want to output later in your code, like a product name or a person’s name.
When you create a string, it’s important to remember that you can’t change the letters inside it. It’s like a bookmark that you’ve written on a piece of paper and taped to your computer screen.

## Operators

An operator is a sign or symbol that tells your computer to perform a specific task.
For example, when you add two numbers together, you’re using the addition operator.
Equally, when you subtract two numbers, you’re using the subtraction operator.
You can use operators in TypeScript to make your code more efficient. They allow you to perform tasks like mathematical calculations and conditional tests in a single line of code, which means less typing and more time for other tasks.
Operators are like building blocks for your code. If you understand them, you can use them to create more complex and interesting code.

## Conditional Statements

A conditional statement is a code segment that only runs if a certain condition is true. You can use conditional statements to control the flow of your code, meaning you can make it go in different directions depending on certain outcomes.
Conditional statements can include certain conditions, such as when a number is greater than or less than another number, or whether a specific piece of data exists.
You can use conditional statements in TypeScript to make your code run in different ways depending on a certain state of the program. For example, you can use a conditional statement to run a certain piece of code only when a certain condition is true.

## Loops

Loops are a series of instructions that are repeated several times. You can use loops to perform certain tasks over and over again, which is great if you have a large amount of data to process.
Loops can be either conditional or non-conditional. A conditional loop will only run when a certain condition is true, while a non-conditional loop will run regardless of the situation.
Looping is a very common programming technique. You can use loops to process large amounts of data, run some code multiple times, and more.

## Objects

An object is a collection of properties, values, and data that you can store together in one place.
You can use objects to store pieces of information that are related to each other, like a person’s name and their address. You can also use objects to group together pieces of data that you want to perform an action on, like a group of numbers or letters.
You can use objects in TypeScript to group data together so that it’s easier to understand and work with. You can also use objects to store data that you want to perform an action on, like a group of numbers that you want to add together.

## Conclusion

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s a core language used by websites and apps, and it can be used in just about any programming environment. In addition to that, JavaScript is also used for front-end design, making it even more versatile and useful.

JavaScript has many helpful features that make it easier to work with, including variables, constants, strings, and operators. You can also use conditional statements to control the flow of your code, and loops can make it easier to process large amounts of data.

There are many ways to make your code more efficient through efficient programming techniques. With JavaScript being such an important language, it’s important to understand these basics to get the most out of it.
