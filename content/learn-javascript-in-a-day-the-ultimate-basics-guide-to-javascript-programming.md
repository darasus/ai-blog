## What Is Javascript?

JavaScript is an interpreted computer programming language. People often use it to create interactive and dynamic websites, web apps, and computer programs. It’s commonly used for an increasing number of tasks, including server-side logic, image manipulation, and video animations. Professional programmers use JavaScript for a wide range of applications and have employed it to create multi-billion-dollar industries, including online gaming, e-commerce, and online banking.

In the early days, JavaScript was the only programming language that ran inside web browsers. This meant that the programming language was used exclusively to make websites interactive, like adding tooltips, pop-ups, image galleries, and image rollovers. The language is now a fundamental tool for creating websites and web applications.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

Being the most popular programming language in the world, JavaScript is the language for creating interactive and dynamic websites and web apps. In fact, it’s one of the most commonly used languages in the world, and is frequently used for computer programming. 
Programmers use JavaScript to create online applications and programs, as well as design and develop websites like social media sites. It’s one of the most versatile languages out there. You can even use JavaScript to build artificial intelligence programs and computer games.
There are endless possibilities when it comes to JavaScript. You can use it to create products and services, build online programs, and design websites. Plus, it’s a skill that’s in high demand, with constant job opportunities and a large salary potential. If you want to pursue a promising career path and make useful and valuable contributions to your field, then JavaScript is for you!

## Who Should Learn Javascript?

Anyone interested in exploring programming as a profession should consider studying JavaScript. It’s a fundamental skill that can be applied to almost any industry.

If you want to make a career out of website design and development, then learning JavaScript is essential. It’s the language that powers website functionality and interaction. Website developers use JavaScript to design interactive websites, such as adding pop-ups and image rollovers.

JavaScript is a useful skill in other industries as well. It’s frequently used in computer programming, and is used to create computer games and artificial intelligence programs. It’s often used in data science and machine learning.

## Jumping Into JS: Basics and Fundamentals

Now that we’ve covered the basics of what JavaScript is and what it can be used for, it’s time to jump into the fundamentals of the programming language. We’ll explore the basic rules and syntax to programming in JavaScript.

The first step of learning any new language is learning its rules and syntax. The basics are the foundation of any language, and without understanding them, you won’t be able to progress.

We’ll start with variables. Variables are containers that store information, which can be a number, text, or even mathematical formula. You can use them for various functions and tasks, and you’ll find them in almost every computer program.

## Variables

A variable is a place for information to be stored and referenced later on. A variable can be a number, text, image, etc. They are denoted by a name that can be anything, as long as it is not a reserved word or keyword.

As an example, let’s say you run a software company and you want to track the number of customers you have. You could start with a variable called customers, and every time a new customer signs up, you would add 1 to the variable. You can then use the variable later on in the program to show how many customers you have.

## Operators

An operator is a symbol, character, or word that tells the computer to perform a mathematical or logical operation. There are many types of operators, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison operators.
Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers, as well as calculations, such as adding two numbers together. A bitwise operator is used to perform operations on binary (computer) numbers.

Below are some examples of operators:

- Mathematical Operations (Addition, Subtraction, etc.)

- Comparison Operations (Greater Than, Less Than, Etc.)

- Logical Operations (And, Or, Not, etc.)

## Conditional Statements

The conditional statement is the method that a computer program uses to make decisions. It’s often a comparison between two or more expressions, such as you’re $100 account balance is greater than $20. It’s followed by an action or result, such as transfer money from savings account to checking account.
Conditional statements are used in programming to make decisions, such as if you are under 18, you cannot purchase alcohol. They’re common in computer programs, such as: if the person has enough points, they get an extra life.
A conditional statement consists of an IF-THEN statement. The IF tells the computer to perform an action if something is true, and the THEN tells the computer to perform an action if something is false.

## Loops

A loop is a programming statement used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. There are two types of loops: while and for.
While Loops - A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. For example, while your account balance is less than $10, keep withdrawing money from your savings account.
While loops are used when you don’t know how many times a code will run.
For Loops - A for loop repeats a block of code a certain number of times. For example, for every item in the shopping cart, knock $5 off the price.
For loops are used when you know how many times a code will run.

## Conclusion

Programming can be a challenging and daunting career path, but the reward is extremely satisfying. If you’re passionate about coding and want to apply it to your everyday life, you can use JavaScript for pretty much anything you want.

You’ll find yourself visiting websites and using apps more often, and you may even notice that things are a bit more interactive. Websites and apps use JavaScript for a variety of things, such as adding pop-ups, changing images, and even playing music!
If you’re interested in pursuing a career in programming, then JavaScript is a great language to start with. It’s a fundamental skill that is used in many different industries, and is the language that powers website functionality and interaction.
