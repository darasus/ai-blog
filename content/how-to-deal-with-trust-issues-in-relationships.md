  abusive partner. Don’t rush things and fix everything at once just leads to

intro: >-
  When you first start dating someone, trust probably isn’t the biggest
  issue on your mind. You’re getting to know this person and trying to figure
  out if there might be a potential future with them or not. However, once you
  get into a relationship with this person and things get more serious, trust
  can very quickly become an issue.

  Even if you don’t trust someone right away, that doesn’t mean the trust issues don’t come up later on. It may take time for them to make you feel uneasy or distrustful of your partner. But it also could be something that crops up almost immediately – especially if you meet them in a place like a nightclub, bar or other place where people tend to hookup without much thought as to who they’re hooking up with! This article will offer some tips on how to deal with these trust issues in relationships and help resolve any problems from arising in the first place.

## Don’t Ignore Red Flags

Just because you’re dating someone new and you’re unsure if you trust them, it doesn’t mean you need to call off the entire relationship. However, there are some instances where you should definitely be paying attention to your red flags and paying attention to your instincts. Certain things may indicate that you’re dealing with a manipulative or abusive partner, and you need to be aware of those things and know when you need to get out. If you’re ever in a situation where you feel unsafe, you should leave as soon as possible. If you’re in a relationship with someone and you feel like you’re being controlled or aren’t allowed to have any friends or interests outside of the relationship, that’s a huge red flag.

## You Can’t Fix Everything At Once

One of the biggest mistakes people make when they start dating someone new is trying to fix every single trust issue at once. You may want to trust your partner right away, but you may also want them to trust you right away, too. However, you can’t expect everything to fall into place right away. It takes time and effort to build a healthy relationship and trust takes time, too. It’s okay to start off more slowly, with more boundaries and limitations, until you two can build up a stronger foundation together. Trying to rush things and fix everything at once just leads to more stress and problems rather than solutions.

## Communicate Your Needs And Concerns

While you don’t want to try to fix everything at once, you also don’t want to ignore your needs and concerns, either. Let your partner know what you need from them, such as an agreement on what type of relationship you two are in, the expectations you have of the relationship, and anything else that may be concerning you. If you let those things out in the open, it can help you feel better about the relationship and help your partner feel more secure and safe, too. It can also help you both figure out what needs to be changed and what boundaries and limitations need to be adjusted as the relationship progresses. This will also help avoid trust issues from arising as the relationship moves forward.

## It Takes Time To Build Trust

Like we mentioned above, trust takes time. It’s not something that can happen overnight or even within a few weeks. It takes months, sometimes even years, to build trust. So, if you’re dating someone and you feel like the trust issues are getting in the way of the relationship, don’t panic. Instead, try to take a step back and give the relationship more time to grow and develop. Once you’ve both been able to show your trust and have been able to prove that your words are genuine, the trust issues should start to resolve themselves and the relationship will become much stronger because of it.

## Conclusion

When you first start dating someone, trust probably isn’t the biggest issue on your mind. You’re getting to know this person and trying to figure out if there might be a potential future with them or not. However, once you get into a relationship with this person and things get more serious, trust can very quickly become an issue.

You can’t ignore trust issues, but you also don’t want to try to fix everything at once. It takes time to build trust and you need to let your partner know what you need and want from them. Once you two have been able to establish a stronger foundation together, the trust issues should start to resolve themselves and your relationship will become much stronger because of it.
