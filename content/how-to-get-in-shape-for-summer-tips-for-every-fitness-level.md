summary: Getting in shape takes time, and you will have setbacks along the way.
  Remember that getting in shape isn’t just about lifting weights or building
  muscle, it’s important to remember that you’re not just trying to lose weight
  while building muscle will slow down your progress. Make sure that you're not
  pushing yourself too hard on your fitness goals. Track what you eat and how
  much you move in order to get the most out of your workouts, and how you eat.
intro: >-
  When summer rolls around, everyone seems to want to look their best.
  After all, it’s the season of tank tops, swimsuits, and short shorts. The
  problem is that not everyone hits the gym year-round or has access to a gym
  that fits their needs. If you tend to slack on your fitness game once the snow
  begins falling and leaves start falling from the trees again, now is the time
  to start making changes so that you’re ready for summer. 

  Whether you’re looking for ways to get back in shape after a long winter hibernation or just hoping to avoid ending up in an unflattering bathing suit this summer, hitting the gym as often as possible is essential. But what if you don’t have a gym membership? Or what if you can only commit to working out at home? Luckily we have some great tips for how you can get in shape for summer no matter where you are.

## Know Your Limits

One of the things that can make getting in shape so difficult is that everyone has their own set of challenges, limitations, and barriers to success. If you have any serious injuries, chronic health conditions, or other physical limitations, this can make it even harder to find fitness options that work for you. Before you even start planning your fitness routine, make sure you understand your physical limitations.
For example, if you tend to experience knee pain when running, you’ll want to look for other cardio options that don’t put as much stress on your knees. If your schedule doesn’t allow for a full-on gym routine, you might want to look for at-home exercises that fit your needs.

## Are You Committed?

One of the biggest challenges that people run into when trying to get in shape is finding ways to stay committed. When you’re working out, you’ll inevitably hit plateaus, experience little setbacks, and find yourself in what feels like a neverending cycle of starting and stopping. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t hit your weekly goals, or feel like you’re not progressing. If you’ve never tried to get in shape before, you’re going to have to start from square one. While you may have been successful at losing weight or building muscle at some point in the past, you may need to change your routine. If you’re not committed to sticking to your fitness goals, you’re not likely to get the results you want. Just remember that getting in shape takes time, and you will have setbacks along the way.

## Set Realistic Goals

While you should never set fitness goals that are too easy, you don’t want to set yourself up for failure by trying to accomplish too much, too soon. Like everything else, building your fitness routine should be a process. You don’t want to jump right into a full-blown exercise routine if you’ve been sedentary for years. Start slow and make sure that you’re increasing the difficulty of your workouts slowly.

If you’re looking to lose weight, remember that weight loss doesn’t happen overnight. Depending on your starting point, it can take months or even years to get the results you’re looking for. If you’re looking to build muscle, it’s important to remember that you don’t need to lose weight to do so. In fact, trying to lose weight while also building muscle will slow down your progress.

## Hit The Weights

In addition to cardio, you’ll also want to make sure that you’re incorporating weight training into your fitness routine. Although cardio is great for burning calories and improving your health, it won’t do much to help you build muscle. In fact, if you’re trying to build muscle, too much cardio can actually slow down your progress.
You can incorporate weight training into your routine in a variety of ways. You can join a group fitness class that incorporates weights into the routine, you can hire a personal trainer who can help you incorporate weights into your routine, or you can hit the free weights at your local gym.

## Cardio Is Just As Important

Getting in shape isn’t just about lifting weights. While many people focus on building muscle, they tend to overlook the importance of cardio. While building muscle helps you burn more calories, cardio can help you burn more calories overall.
You can choose to do cardio in a variety of ways. If you don’t have access to a gym, you can try running, hiking, swimming, cycling, or taking an elliptical machine at the gym. You can also try doing more intense, shorter workouts, like Tabata and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workouts.

## Strength Train, Too!

While you should definitely incorporate both cardio and weights into your fitness routine, you also need to make sure that you’re not forgetting about the importance of building your core, stretching, and improving your posture and flexibility.
You should incorporate a little bit of core work into every strength training routine. You can also incorporate more intense core work into your routine, especially if you’re trying to lose weight.

While you should definitely build up your strength, you also need to make sure that you don’t overdo it. Strength training is great for improving your posture and flexibility, but if you push yourself too hard, you can actually cause yourself more harm than good.

## Track What You Eat And How Much You Move

In order to get the most out of your workouts, you need to fuel your body properly. One of the best ways to do this is to track what you eat and how much you move. You can utilize a fitness app, like Fitocracy, that will help you keep track of your workouts and calories so that you know what you need to do more of and what you should cut back on.
Keeping track of what you eat and how much you move can be a little bit of work, but it can really help you stay accountable and reach your fitness goals faster. It can also help you identify areas where you need to make improvements and areas where you may be able to cut back a bit without sacrificing results.

## Bottom Line

Getting in shape for summer is a challenge that many of us face every year. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to drop a few pounds or build muscle mass: getting in shape for summer is a tough, but important, goal.
Remember that you’re not alone in this journey. Even if it feels like you’re struggling to make progress, you can find support in online communities and from friends and family who are trying to make healthy changes too.
If you follow these tips and make a commitment to getting in shape for summer, you’ll be one step closer to looking and feeling your best.
