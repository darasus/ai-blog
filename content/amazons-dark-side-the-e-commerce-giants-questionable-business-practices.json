  "summary": "Amazon has been accused of paying its fulfillment center employees 15% less than the minimum wage. This is despite receiving millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state of California. Amazon is currently facing 9 separate lawsuits for unfair business practices. The most high-profile of these is a lawsuit from the State of Washington, alleging that Amazon has broken anti-trust laws. Amazon tracks almost everything you do and knows more about you than you think. This has raised privacy concerns among consumer watchdogs who have described Amazon’s actions as “unwanted” and “alarming”",
