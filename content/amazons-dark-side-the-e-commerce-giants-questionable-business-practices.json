  "summary": "Amazon has been accused of paying its fulfillment center employees 15% less than the minimum wage. This is despite receiving millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state of California. Amazon is currently facing 9 separate lawsuits for unfair business practices. The most high-profile of these is a lawsuit from the State of Washington, alleging that Amazon has broken anti-trust laws. Amazon tracks almost everything you do and knows more about you than you think.
