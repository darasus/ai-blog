The idea of your project seems so fascinating that you can\\u2019t wait to get back to it. Unfortunately, the time when you least want to work is exactly when you need to work.\nWorking feels like a burden and every task seems like an uphill struggle. You hate yourself for putting off something that is so beneficial for your future and your career. You\\u2019re also terrified about what will happen if you don\\u2019t finish this assignment by tomorrow. You don\\u2019t want to fail the course, lose your scholarship and end up homeless somewhere in a strange city where none of your friends live. However, all of this seems much more appealing than getting back to work on the project again; it\\u2019s even more appealing than thinking about how difficult life will be without the degree or scholarship at home.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
