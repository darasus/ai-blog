A few minutes spent stretching out before hitting the weights or putting in some easy cardio can go a long way towards preventing injury, as well as helping you get the most out of your workout.

That can make it hard to get into a comfortable rhythm and make the most of your time on the treadmill. Instead of watching the numbers go up on the display, try turning on the TV and watching something to help you pass the time.
