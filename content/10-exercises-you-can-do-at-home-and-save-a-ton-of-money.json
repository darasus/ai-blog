A few minutes spent stretching out before hitting the weights or putting in some easy cardio can go a long way towards preventing injury, as well as helping you get the most out of your workout. If you really want to get the most out of your wait-and-warm-up period, you can also use it as an opportunity to practice your breathing and mental focus techniques, both of which can be highly beneficial to your workout routine.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Run In The Treadmill While You\\u2019re Watching TV\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re using the treadmill as part of your home workout, you may be anxious about keeping your speed and intensity at the correct levels, especially if you\\u2019re new to working out. That can make it hard to get into a comfortable rhythm and make the most of your time on the treadmill. Instead of watching the numbers go up on the display, try turning on the TV and watching something to help you pass the time. Not only will this help keep you from becoming bored, but it will also help you stay focused on your speed and intensity, which will allow you to get more out of your treadmill time.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Use A Jumping Strap Instead Of Your Gym\\u2019s Treadmill\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Jumping on a treadmill is a great way to get a fantastic cardio workout.

Jumping rope is a fantastic cardio exercise, and you can easily do it at home with a jump rope, no matter what your skill level is.

Using a dumbbell instead of the machine will allow you to move freely and target your muscles more effectively.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are many exercises that require specific equipment, but you can often replicate the exercises with things you already have at home.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Buy A Kettlebell Instead Of An Electronic Shocker\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some home workout videos will feature an exercise called a \\u201CRussian squat,\\u201D which can be done with either a barbell or a kettlebell.

Bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and planks are great for targeting multiple parts of your body.
