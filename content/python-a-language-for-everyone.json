Python can also be used for scripting \\u2014 running a series of code in a desired order.

In Python, you can simply write the following code: if condition:\nWhile many other programming languages would require you to write that same code like this: if condition then\nend if\nLoops are similarly simple and straightforward in Python. To create a for loop that runs five times, you simply write the following code: for i in range(5):\nFor many programming languages, this same code would require you to write it like this: for i = 0; i  5; i++\nend\nLoops and conditionals in Python are clear and understandable, while many other programming languages require an unnecessary amount of effort to both read and write.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Built-in Data Types and Services\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the most important aspects of any programming language is the data types it offers and the services it provides.
