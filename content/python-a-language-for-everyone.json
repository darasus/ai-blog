It\\u2019s simple, fast, and predictable with no unnecessary syntax and a lightweight syntax that leads to programs that are easy to read and understand.\nGo has several built-in features that let it stand out from other general programming languages. For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
