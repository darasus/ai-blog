The creators of Python \\u2014 an open-source general-purpose programming language first released in 1991 \\u2014 recognized from the start that if they were going to succeed, they needed to create a language that was accessible and appealing to a wide audience.

As an interactive language, Python is useful for running one or a few lines of code as a test. Interactive code might be used to test out a particular procedure, or to try out a new technique that you\\u2019re trying to learn. Python can also be used for scripting \\u2014 running a series of code in a desired order. You might use scripting if you want to automate a task that you run frequently, or to create a program for a computer that doesn\\u2019t have an equivalent in Python. For example, you might write a script to send regular emails, or to access and alter data on a website.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Simple By Design\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Simple, elegant and accessible. These are the sorts of adjectives we use to describe the best tools and languages that we use daily. Python\\u2019s syntax is unobtrusive and helpful, making it a joy to use. Unlike many other programming languages, you don\\u2019t have to memorize a thousand rules in order to understand and create code in Python. In fact, Python is designed so that you don\\u2019t even have to think about the rules and syntax of the language as you write your code. Instead, Python\\u2019s syntax is so straightforward that it feels like you\\u2019re simply writing words. Python\\u2019s open-source nature made the language completely free to use and, as such, it\\u2019s a good choice to learn as a beginner. Simply put, you can\\u2019t go wrong with Python and there isn\\u2019t much to go wrong in the first place!\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Easy to Read and Write\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Besides being straightforward, Python\\u2019s syntax is also extremely readable, making it a pleasure to read and write code. For example, when you have to create a conditional statement that checks for a certain condition, then executes a certain block of code if the condition is true, Python\\u2019s syntax makes it easy to understand what\\u2019s happening. In Python, you can simply write the following code: if condition:\nWhile many other programming languages would require you to write that same code like this: if condition then\nend if\nLoops are similarly simple and straightforward in Python. To create a for loop that runs five times, you simply write the following code: for i in range(5):\nFor many programming languages, this same code would require you to write it like this: for i = 0; i  5; i++\nend\nLoops and conditionals in Python are clear and understandable, while many other programming languages require an unnecessary amount of effort to both read and write.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Built-in Data Types and Services\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the most important aspects of any programming language is the data types it offers and the services it provides. If a language doesn\\u2019t offer the features and services you need, you\\u2019ll never use it.

Python also offers a whole host of services, including the ability to read and write from various data sources, the ability to use various programming paradigms, and the ability to use modules and packages.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While not every language has to offer the same services and data types, the fact that Python does is a huge plus for the language.
