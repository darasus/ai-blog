summary: To make space for your hobbies, start by identifying these meaningless
  or non-essential tasks. If you spend hours on end doing housework or errands
  that can easily be outsourced to others, you might want to hire someone to
  handle those tasks for you. Let go of something that no longer brings you joy
  or that you’ve outgrown. Ask for help with your hobbies and ask your loved
  ones to help you create time for them. Hobbies can be a great way to build new
  skills and foster creativity and curiosity.
intro: When you love something, it feels like there’s not enough time in the day
  to do everything you want to do. But at the same time, when you don’t have
  anything that fills your days with joy and meaning, it feels like there are
  not enough hours in a week. Many people struggle with finding time for their
  hobbies. They either feel too busy or believe that they simply don’t have the
  opportunities to pursue something they enjoy. This feeling is
  understandable—because most people lead incredibly busy lives. Work, school,
  family, friends, and other obligations take up a lot of time and energy. So
  how can you carve out some time for your hobbies? It might seem impossible
  right now—but trust us, it’s possible! Even if your schedule feels full beyond
  measure right now, there are always little cracks of space that can grow and
  expand into larger windows of opportunity.

## Cut Out Tasks That Don’t Contribute to Meaning and Happiness

When we’re feeling overwhelmed and swamped, it’s often because we’re holding on to tasks that don’t contribute to our happiness or that don’t matter at all. These tasks take up space and time that could be devoted to our passions! To make space for your hobbies, start by identifying these meaningless or non-essential tasks. For example, if you’re spending a lot of time on social media, but it’s not bringing you any real joy or helping you meet your goals, you might want to consider taking a break. Or if you spend hours on end doing housework or errands that can easily be outsourced to others, you might want to hire someone to handle those tasks for you. Sometimes it’s not about adding more things to our plates—it’s about eliminating the things that don’t matter so that we can make room for the things that do.

## Make Time By Prioritizing What’s Most Important To You

If you want to make time for your hobbies, they have to be important enough to you that you’re willing to make room for them. This means that you need to prioritize them as if they were work or family obligations. So, let’s say you want to make time for painting on the weekends. How important is this activity to you? Would you be willing to wake up at 6 am on Sunday to paint for a few hours? Would you be willing to forgo watching TV or relaxing on the weekend? Would you be willing to give up an hour of sleep on Saturday night or wake up 30 minutes earlier so that you have time to get things done? You’ll have to make sacrifices and prioritize your hobbies. And if you want to make time for exercise, you might have to wake up even earlier. You might also have to carve out time for these activities during your workday.

## Try Something New

If you’ve been pursuing the same hobbies for years and years, you might be feeling a bit bored or uninspired. Or maybe you’ve been neglecting a hobby or passion that you used to love. A great way to make time for something new is to let go of an old hobby. Let go of something that no longer brings you joy or that you’ve outgrown. There’s no sense in holding on to something that no longer brings you joy when there are other activities that you could be doing instead!

## Ask For Help

If you’re struggling to make time for your hobbies, consider talking to your loved ones. Ask them to help you create time for your hobbies. There are many things that you can ask for help with. For example, maybe you want to make time for art, but you don’t have a studio or a place to paint or draw. You could ask a friend if you can rent their studio or find someone on Craigslist who might let you use their space for a small fee. Maybe you want to make time for yoga, but you don’t have the funds to join a studio. You could ask a friend if you can use their mat or borrow yoga videos from them.

## Bottom line

Life is short and unpredictable. We never know what’s coming our way—so it’s important to make time for the things that bring us joy and that we love. Hobbies can be a great way to de-stress and recharge, too. They can be an excellent outlet for our emotions and energy when we don’t know where else to put it. Hobbies can also be a great way to build new skills and foster creativity and curiosity. Whether you’re into sports, crafts, games, or something else, hobbies are a great way to engage in something that you love and invest in yourself. So don’t let your busy life get in the way of making time for your hobbies!
