If you\\u2019re reading this blog right now, chances are you do too. But how much do you know about the phone you carry around with you everywhere? There\\u2019s a lot of information out there on Apple Inc and its products, but not all of it is useful.

The tricky thing about having so many devices from one company is that it can be hard to find information that applies directly to each device as an individual unit.
