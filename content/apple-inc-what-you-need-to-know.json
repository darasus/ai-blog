These companies are harvesting user information and using it to further their own business interests, often at the expense of user privacy and well-being.\nThese examples of how big tech is harming society will help you see these companies for what they really are: greedy corporations with little regard for consumer welfare other than how it impacts their bottom line.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, as more people use the internet and begin interacting with various programs and applications on websites, things become slightly more complicated.\nAs you probably know if you browse social media sites or read news articles online frequently, there are now several different \\u201Clanguages\\u201D being used on websites to make them more interactive.
