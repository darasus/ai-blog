summary: Go has a number of benefits that make it a good choice for DBAs. It is
  easy to learn and read, and it has built-in support for concurrency. Go has
  good support for big data. It makes it easy to distribute data across multiple
  machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary. Go also
  makes it easier to access web services. It has built in support for JSON
  parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web
  apps.
intro: >-
  The demand for skilled database administrators is on the rise. As
  businesses continue to adopt cloud-based solutions and big data technologies,
  the need for skilled DBAs has never been greater. The average retention rate
  for DBAs is at 96 percent, which means that this role is in high demand and
  there aren’t a lot of people who want to do it. 

  There are more than 20 languages that you can use to build applications databases. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to the various tasks involved in database management such as creating views and stored procedures, monitoring performance, creating indexes, and auditing user access privileges.

  DBAs should have broad knowledge of different database management systems (DBMS) so they can identify which one is most suitable for each scenario. In general, there are three main types of DBMSs: Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), Document-oriented Database Management Systems (DDMS), and Hybrid Database Management Systems (HDBMS).

## Why Go is Good for Database Administration?

Go has a number of benefits that make it a good choice for DBAs. First of all, it is easy to learn and read. Since DBAs need to read and understand code written by other developers, it’s helpful if the language is straightforward. Another benefit is that Go makes it easy for DBAs to concatenate strings. Another important feature for DBAs is the built-in support for debugging and logging. This can be helpful when trying to figure out why a query might be slow, or why a table is full.

## 6 Reasons to use Go for DBAs

Go is a statically typed language, which means that the type of data expected in each line of code must be specified. This helps to identify errors sooner. It also means that DBAs don’t have to worry about which data type to use when creating tables. Go has good built-in support for concurrent programming. This makes it a good choice for scaling applications to support large numbers of users.
It has built-in support for JSON parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web apps. Go has good support for big data. This is partly because Go makes it easy to distribute data across multiple machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary.
Go supports interoperability with other languages via its standard library and its C-like syntax. This makes it easy for DBAs to integrate with other technologies such as Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.

## Go has good support for big data

While all modern programming languages claim to be good for big data, Go actually delivers on this promise. The Go standard library has a suite of tools that make it easy to process large datasets and scale them up to take advantage of distributed processing. The standard library comes with a Hadoop MapReduce implementation that can process data in parallel across a cluster of machines.

The Go standard library also contains critical tools like the Hashing package and the Standard Library package that make it easy to implement common data structures such as a binary tree or a hash table. Finally, unlike other languages, the Go standard library doesn’t require the use of a database. This makes it easier to process very large datasets that don’t fit in memory or that don’t need to be stored permanently.

## Go has good support for interoperability

If a business uses multiple service providers and tools, then it may need to integrate the data from these systems with its own data. Go offers a good choice for integrating with various databases, including those used by other applications. This can be useful if a company wants to make use of data stored in a legacy database, or if it wants to ingest data from another system. Go also makes it easy to access web services. This makes it a good language for building microservices.

## Go has built-in support for concurrency

While all modern programming languages offer some support for concurrency, Go makes it particularly easy and efficient to implement. In most programming languages, developers have to manage the way different processes can access and modify data. This can be a complex and error-prone process. In Go, the language manages this for the developer. This can significantly reduce the complexity of writing concurrent code.

## Go has good support for SQL

Most database management systems support SQL as a standardized way of retrieving and managing data. In some database systems, the SQL syntax may vary slightly between vendors. This can make it difficult for a DBA to switch between different systems if they don’t know the syntax for all of them.

Go offers a standard SQL syntax that all DBMSs should conform to. This means that a DBA who knows the Go SQL syntax will be able to switch to another DBMS with minimal effort. It also means that SQL code written in Go can be easily ported to other systems.

## Summary

This article explored why Go is a good choice for database administration. Go is easy to learn and read, and it has built-in support for concurrency. It also has good support for big data, and good support for SQL. With all of these benefits, Go makes it easier for DBAs to manage databases at scale.
