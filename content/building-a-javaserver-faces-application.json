This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so. Let us explore how we can leverage interfaces in our code to make it more modular, reusable, testable and readable.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The best network administrators manage to plan for the future by anticipating problems from the present and creating plans to deal with them before they arise. However, this can be difficult when working in a fast-paced industry with so much change happening at once.\nIn response to this challenge, Go\\u2014a simple programming language developed by Google that makes it easier to create software packages\\u2014is gaining traction as an ideal tool for creating programs for operating and managing computer networks. Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques. If you\\u2019re interested in using Go to make your career as a network administrator easier or even transition into becoming one, read on for more information about why you should learn Go for Network Administration and the best places to get started with your learning today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
