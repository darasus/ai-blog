Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Even if you\\u2019re a pro coder, sometimes logic and algorithms just don\\u2019t click. The best coders know how to tackle those tough spots by researching solutions, studying best practices, and implementing new techniques.\nCoding is a skill that requires constant refinement to stay relevant in today\\u2019s tech-heavy world. While coding might seem like a very technical skill, it actually has many parallels with other creative fields like writing or music. The more you code, the better you get at it.\nLearning how to code effectively and efficiently is a big challenge for anyone working in this field or looking to break into it. But once you have the basics down, it\\u2019s all about refining your technique and increasing your efficiency so that you can complete projects faster while producing higher quality results.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
