This application will contain a form that accepts a user input, and once submitted, the application will display the data entered by the user. The data can be stored in JavaBeans-like fields and can be manipulated in the same way as regular editors and validators.

This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

To do that, choose File | New | Project from the menu. Then, select the Java category and on the next screen choose the JavaServer Faces category. In the ensuing dialog box, select the Basic (JSF 2.x) option and click Next. On the next screen, specify a suitable Java package, project name, and click Finish to create the project.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create a simple JavaServer Faces application with a single view and a few managed beans. This application will contain a form that accepts a user input, and once submitted, the application will display the data entered by the user. ## Set up Java and Gradle\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In order to use JavaServer Faces in IntelliJ IDEA, we need to select the Java 9 runtime as the project's default JDK. This can be done in the Project Structure dialog box by adding a new JDK, selecting the desired version from the drop-down list, and clicking OK.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"We also need to configure the build tool and source control settings. To do that, open the Settings/Preferences dialog box, select Build, Execution, Deployment | Compilers, and click Java Compiler. From the Java Compiler dialog box, select the desired version, the source folder, and the Target folder. Then, select the Standard JVM Code Path.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Next, select the Gradle version and choose the location of the Gradle wrapper. Finally, enable the Use Source and Target folders option and disable the Show only selected items option. ## Configuring JVM Options\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"We will configure JVM options to enable the following options: -Xms512m -Xmx2048m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=false -Dorg.apache.logging.Log=org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger -Dlog4j.logger.org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager=DEBUG,console -Dlog4j.logger.org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger=WARN,console -Dlog4j.logger.org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler=WARN,console -Dlog4j.logger.com.intellij.util.logging.InternalLoggerFactory=DEBUG,console -Dorg.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source=1.9 -Dorg.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.target=1.9 -Dorg.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.misc=true ## Create Facelets Folder and Viewing Template\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As JavaServer Faces applications are built with Facelet files, we need to create a new folder named \\u201Cweb\\u201D in the root of our project and place the Facelet files there. For creating a new folder in the root of a project, we can use the \\u201CFile | New | Folder\\u201D menu.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"We also need to create a template view for our application. In the \\u201Cweb\\u201D folder, create another folder named \\u201Cfaces\\u201D and place the view there. To create a view for our application, select the \\u201Cfaces\\u201D folder and choose \\u201CFile | New | Other\\u201D from the menu. On the dialog box that opens, select JavaServer Faces view from the \\u201CTemplates\\u201D drop-down list and click Next.

Click Finish to create the template view. ## Define Application Beans and \\xA0View-scoped Beans\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For the purpose of this tutorial, we will define a simple managed bean with a single properties entry and a method.
