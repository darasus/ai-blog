This is important because it means that businesses need to be aware that the technology is still unproven, and therefore its risks are largely unquantifiable.\nFor example, businesses that use blockchain may find that the technology doesn\\u2019t meet their needs. If blockchain isn\\u2019t appropriate for your business and you don\\u2019t have the flexibility to change course, you could suffer significant losses.\nThis is particularly true for large and established businesses that have significant budgets and are risk averse.

This means that there are significant usability issues that will need to be resolved before it\\u2019s ready for primetime.\nFor example, there are currently several different types of blockchain that are in use, such as public, permissioned, and private blockchains. Each one of these has their own particular use cases and limitations. Figuring out which type is best for your business and how to use it can be a significant challenge.\nFurthermore, blockchain networks are typically built using open-source software. This means that the code is freely available, but that it also lacks the stability and security that comes with commercially-built software.\nComparatively, traditional software is extremely well understood and has been used in businesses across the world for decades.

As a result, they want to jump in and implement blockchain in any situation where it doesn\\u2019t make sense. This can lead to significant problems as blockchains aren\\u2019t a magic bullet for all problems.\nFor example, if your business process is faulty, no type of technology will be able to fix it. In fact, it will likely make the problem worse.\nFor blockchain to be successful, your company needs to have a solid business process in place. This means that all employees understand their roles and the expected workflow.\nIf there are significant issues with your business process, blockchain won\\u2019t be able to resolve them.

This isn\\u2019t to say that other technologies don\\u2019t also pose a risk. However, as blockchain is relatively new and has a significant level of hype behind it, it is a prime target for cybercriminals.\nIndeed, cybercrime has been a problem with cryptocurrencies since they were first developed. The high-profile hacks of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange and Coincheck exchange are just two examples of high-profile blockchain hacks in recent years.\nOnce again, this isn\\u2019t to say that other types of technology don\\u2019t have cybercrime issues, but it is something that businesses need to be aware of and take into consideration when making decisions about blockchain.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Consumer data may be unreliable\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In the blockchain, transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger.

This could mean that sensitive personal data, such as credit card numbers, could be compromised if malicious actors were able to get access to this information.\nIndeed, there are currently several decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that are being built on blockchain technology where users will be able to trade cryptocurrencies with each other. This means that there is an inherent risk that someone will be able to access sensitive information.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Bottom line\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Overall, blockchain is an exciting technology that is poised to see significant growth in the coming years.

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself.
