This is important because it means that businesses need to be aware that the technology is still unproven, and therefore its risks are largely unquantifiable.\nFor example, businesses that use blockchain may find that the technology doesn\\u2019t meet their needs. If blockchain isn\\u2019t appropriate for your business and you don\\u2019t have the flexibility to change course, you could suffer significant losses.\nThis is particularly true for large and established businesses that have significant budgets and are risk averse.

Each one of these has their own particular use cases and limitations. Figuring out which type is best for your business and how to use it can be a significant challenge.\nFurthermore, blockchain networks are typically built using open-source software. This means that the code is freely available, but that it also lacks the stability and security that comes with commercially-built software.\nComparatively, traditional software is extremely well understood and has been used in businesses across the world for decades.

As a result, they want to jump in and implement blockchain in any situation where it doesn\\u2019t make sense. This can lead to significant problems as blockchains aren\\u2019t a magic bullet for all problems.\nFor example, if your business process is faulty, no type of technology will be able to fix it. In fact, it will likely make the problem worse.\nFor blockchain to be successful, your company needs to have a solid business process in place. This means that all employees understand their roles and the expected workflow.\nIf there are significant issues with your business process, blockchain won\\u2019t be able to resolve them.

This isn\\u2019t to say that other technologies don\\u2019t also pose a risk. However, as blockchain is relatively new and has a significant level of hype behind it, it is a prime target for cybercriminals.\nIndeed, cybercrime has been a problem with cryptocurrencies since they were first developed. The high-profile hacks of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange and Coincheck exchange are just two examples of high-profile blockchain hacks in recent years.\nOnce again, this isn\\u2019t to say that other types of technology don\\u2019t have cybercrime issues, but it is something that businesses need to be aware of and take into consideration when making decisions about blockchain.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Consumer data may be unreliable\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In the blockchain, transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger.

In a nutshell, it\\u2019s a decentralized ledger that stores information in places called blocks. Whenever someone wants to add information or a transaction to the ledger, they first need to verify themselves by supplying proof of identity. Each block also has its own unique identifier known as a hash. These identifiers help track information easily without having to store an entire copy of each block, which reduces space significantly and speeds up data transfer speeds significantly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
