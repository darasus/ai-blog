This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.\nThe creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\nThere are a number of factors that could continue to drive demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
