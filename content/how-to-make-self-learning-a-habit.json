Today's learners want to be active and take charge of their own learning experience, rather than being passive recipients of information. They prefer to learn at a time and place of their choosing, rather than fixed class schedules. Instead of focusing on memorizing facts and figures, they desire hands-on experiences and interactive solutions. In other words, modern learners want self-directed learning that is current and relevant\\u2014and thankfully there are many ways to achieve these goals.  Self-learning is an effective way for adults to acquire new knowledge and skills, usually in a field they already have interest in or a career they plan to enter.

It is an independent study that takes place outside of a traditional classroom setting and often at an learner's own pace. Self-learning involves structured activities in which individuals plan their own learning experiences, monitor their progress, set goals and follow a detailed program of readings and practice assignments.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
