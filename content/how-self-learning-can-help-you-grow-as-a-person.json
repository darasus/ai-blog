Today's learners want to be active and take charge of their own learning experience, rather than being passive recipients of information. They prefer to learn at a time and place of their choosing, rather than fixed class schedules. Instead of focusing on memorizing facts and figures, they desire hands-on experiences and interactive solutions. In other words, modern learners want self-directed learning that is current and relevant\\u2014and thankfully there are many ways to achieve these goals.  Self-learning is an effective way for adults to acquire new knowledge and skills, usually in a field they already have interest in or a career they plan to enter. Many adults shy away from self-learning because they think it\\u2019te scary or difficult; it actually requires much less time than you might expect!

It takes a lot of time and practice to be good at it. And that\\u2019s why we need to understand why self-learning is important. Not only will this help us build better AI, but also give us the edge over other coders in the industry.\nSelf-learning bots are designed to learn from their own datasets as well as user input without any external assistance. This makes them different from supervised learning algorithms or even reinforcement learning bots, which both require a human operator or some sort of rewards system to determine whether the AI is performing optimally or not.\nFurther, Self-learning algorithms are particularly useful for applications which have large datasets with many variables and little pre-existing knowledge about how those variables impact one another \\u2013 such as stock market analysis, speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In fact, it is an ongoing, never-ending process. It is a way of thinking, an approach to learning and a set of strategies that can be used at any point in time. Self-learning is basically learning how to learn, so that we can continue to grow even after finishing school or university.\nEven adults prefer different methods of learning such as reading books on their own instead of listening to lectures or attending group classes. There are numerous ways through which you can tap into your inherent abilities and cater to your specific needs as an adult learner.
