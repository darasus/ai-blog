  breathing. This in turn slows down your heart rate, which helps reduce your
  stress level. Another way meditation helps reduce stress is by increasing the
  production of serotonin in your brain. Increased serotonin levels in the brain
  have been shown to reduce feelings of depression and anxiety. It can also help
  you make decisions from a place of calm and help you find meaning in life’s
  challenges. Meditating regularly can also improve your ability to focus and
