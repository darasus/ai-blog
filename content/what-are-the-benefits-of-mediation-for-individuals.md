Mediation is a process in which a mediator facilitates communication between parties to help them resolve a dispute. Mediation is an alternative to traditional litigation in which parties to a dispute present their cases to a judge or jury. Mediation is often used in divorce cases, but can be used in other types of disputes such as business disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, and contract disputes.

Mediation has many benefits for individuals involved in a dispute. Mediation is confidential, which means that the mediator cannot disclose what was said in mediation to anyone outside of the mediation. This allows parties to feel free to discuss their issues without fear of their statements being used against them in court. Mediation is also informal, which means that there are no rules of evidence or procedure that parties must follow. This allows parties to discuss their issues in a more relaxed setting.

Mediation is also flexible, which means that the mediator can tailor the mediation process to the needs of the parties and the dispute. For example, the mediator can allow the parties to have private caucuses, which are meetings between the party and the mediator where the party can discuss their case without the other party present. The mediator can also allow the parties to submit evidence and make statements to the mediator, which can be helpful if one party feels uncomfortable discussing certain issues in front of the other party.

Mediation is also often faster and cheaper than traditional litigation. Mediation can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for the parties, which is often not possible with litigation. In addition, mediation often does not require the use of attorneys, which can save the parties money.

Overall, mediation has many benefits for individuals involved in a dispute. Mediation is confidential, informal, flexible, and often faster and cheaper than traditional litigation. If you are involved in a dispute, you should consider mediation as an alternative to traditional litigation.
