## A brief primer on orbital mechanics

When a spaceship leaves Earth, it doesn’t leave under its own power. Instead, it gets a free ride from the gravity of the Earth. As the Earth rotates, this gravity pulls the ship off in the direction of the east. If the ship travels fast enough, it can get beyond the Earth’s orbit. If the ship has enough velocity to overcome the Earth’s gravity, it will go into a heliocentric orbit. If it travels around the sun and gets far enough away from the Earth, it can then be captured by the gravity of Mars. Once captured by Mars, it will travel in an elliptical orbit around the planet.

## Why staying on Mars is a terrible idea

The Martian surface is an extreme environment: the temperature fluctuates wildly, the CO2 in the air is unbreathable, the UV is intense, and there’s no water. The only way humans could survive on Mars is if they had enough supplies to last for the rest of their lives, along with a way to communicate with Earth.

Suppose we could send someone to Mars with enough supplies to last for their whole lives. Then the rest of us would have to survive without them. So we would have to give up all our valuable international relationships and economic ties; we would have to abandon our entire way of life and start again.

## You can’t breathe the air

As we saw above, the Martian atmosphere is unbreathable. Astronauts have tried wearing oxygen masks, but they could only survive on the surface for 30 minutes or less. If Watney is breathing oxygen from a tank, he will have to be very careful where he goes and what he does – especially with his CO2 filters. He can only get away with these devices because of the low gravity and low CO2 content in the Martian atmosphere.

## The sunlight is too dim

The sunlight on Mars is about 38% as strong as it is on Earth. This is barely enough for plants to synthesize food via photosynthesis. And it’s not enough to power the solar panels that Watney uses to charge his batteries and run his communications equipment. As a result, Watney can’t use the solar panels to produce oxygen, which is a shame because there’s no CO2 on Mars for him to breathe.

## There’s barely any metal

Of course, if you could grow enough food to sustain a colony on Mars, you could also smelt enough metal to build a radio telescope. While we can’t grow enough food on Mars, we could build a radio telescope: it would take a couple of decades, but we could do it.

## The soil is toxic (and there’s no organic food)

The top layer of the Martian soil is full of perchlorate, a chemical that is both toxic and explosive. If you try to grow food with perchlorate in the soil, it will poison the crops. If you try to feed the crops perchlorate, it will explode.

## Summing up

The Martian gives us a glimpse of how difficult it would be to survive on Mars. If we ever send a manned mission, the astronauts will have to bring enough resources to last for the rest of their lives. They will have to carefully avoid poisonous soil, low light levels, and the unbreathable atmosphere. And they will have to overcome the challenge of communicating with Earth.

But the challenges of living on Mars tell us something valuable about ourselves: we’re resilient, creative, and curious. When we’re faced with a challenge, we don’t give up: we find a way to solve it.
