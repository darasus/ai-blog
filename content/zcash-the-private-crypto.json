ZCash was first released in 2016 by Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of the company behind the currency, Zerocoin Electric Company. It allows for users to control their own privacy settings, with public transactions accessible by every user, and private transactions only visible to the sender, receiver and those they give permission to. Zcash is built on the blockchain provided by Proof of Work (PoW), which relies on miners solving complex mathematical problems to add transactions to the blockchain.",

In the same way that Bitcoin has revolutionized the way we store and exchange value, ZCash aims to revolutionize the way we store and exchange information.\nZCash is a unique cryptocurrency in that it allows for both public and private transactions. This allows for users to control their own privacy settings, with public transactions accessible by every user, and private transactions only visible to the sender, receiver and those they give permission to.\nZCash was first released in 2016 by Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of the company behind the currency, Zerocoin Electric Company. It came under the Zerocash Protocol and was rebranded to ZCash later that year.\nZCash started trading on many exchanges shortly after, with its value fluctuating between $10 and $15 per coin. The price has since settled at around $128 per coin as of June 2019.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is Privacy Important in Blockchain?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that allows for the secure and transparent transfer of data. While this is great for financial transactions, blockchain can also be used to secure sensitive information like medical records and contracts. In fact, recent research suggests that blockchain could be the solution to data privacy issues.\nUnfortunately, the details of blockchain are visible to everyone. This means that if your company or organization chooses to store sensitive information on a blockchain network, any hacker who gains access to that data would also be able to see exactly how the information is being used.\nThis can be disastrous, particularly in industries like healthcare that depend on strict privacy laws. In addition, some stakeholders may not want to share their data with the entire blockchain network.\nThis is where ZCash comes in. The currency allows users to encrypt their data so that only those involved in the transaction can see it. This is crucial for industries like healthcare that need to maintain strict data privacy laws.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does ZCash Achieve Privacy?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash uses a concept called \\u201Czero knowledge proof\\u201D to achieve privacy. A zero knowledge proof means that someone can verify that something is true without knowing the details of the transaction. ZCash uses this concept to encrypt the details of a transaction \\u2014 sender, receiver, amount and other information.\nThis is done by splitting the transaction into two parts. One part is a public record of the transaction, and the other is a private record that is only visible to the sender and the receiver.\nZCash achieves privacy in a number of ways. Firstly, the public record is accessible only through a blockchain explorer \\u2014 and even then, only the amount of the transaction is visible. The public record also shows that the transaction was made on the ZCash blockchain, not on the blockchain of the company or organization using ZCash to transact.\nZCash also allows for shielded transactions, which are private transactions that are visible only to the sender, receiver and those they decide to share the details of the transaction with.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Zcash and Bitcoin \\u2013 similarities and differences\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies that allow users to control their own finances without the need for a bank or third party. However, there are some key differences between the two.\nZCash is built on the blockchain provided by Proof of Work (PoW), which relies on miners solving complex mathematical problems to add transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin is also built on the PoW blockchain, but uses a simpler mining process that requires less computing power.\nZCash also allows for private transactions, as described above. Bitcoin does not provide this option, so all transactions are public. This means that every transaction made with Bitcoin is visible to every person on the blockchain. This can be a huge disadvantage for companies that need to keep their finances private.\nZCash also has a slightly different mining process that is not as energy-intensive as PoW mining. It uses a process called Equihash that is designed to be both energy-efficient and memory-intensive.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Zcash Investment Advice\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash is a promising cryptocurrency, but it\\u2019s important that you do your research before making an investment. While some tokens may be more profitable than others in the long-term, your own personal investment strategy should be at the forefront when making decisions like these.\nYou should also be aware of the risks involved with investing in cryptocurrencies. For example, cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated and could be vulnerable to government regulation in the future. If a country decides to ban the use of cryptocurrencies, the value of existing tokens could drop.\nZCash has been around for a few years and is one of the most established cryptocurrencies in the industry.
