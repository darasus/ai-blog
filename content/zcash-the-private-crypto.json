This allows for users to control their own privacy settings, with public transactions accessible by every user, and private transactions only visible to the sender, receiver and those they give permission to.\nZCash was first released in 2016 by Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of the company behind the currency, Zerocoin Electric Company. It came under the Zerocash Protocol and was rebranded to ZCash later that year.\nZCash started trading on many exchanges shortly after, with its value fluctuating between $10 and $15 per coin.

While this is great for financial transactions, blockchain can also be used to secure sensitive information like medical records and contracts. In fact, recent research suggests that blockchain could be the solution to data privacy issues.\nUnfortunately, the details of blockchain are visible to everyone. This means that if your company or organization chooses to store sensitive information on a blockchain network, any hacker who gains access to that data would also be able to see exactly how the information is being used.\nThis can be disastrous, particularly in industries like healthcare that depend on strict privacy laws. In addition, some stakeholders may not want to share their data with the entire blockchain network.\nThis is where ZCash comes in. The currency allows users to encrypt their data so that only those involved in the transaction can see it. This is crucial for industries like healthcare that need to maintain strict data privacy laws.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does ZCash Achieve Privacy?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash uses a concept called \\u201Czero knowledge proof\\u201D to achieve privacy. A zero knowledge proof means that someone can verify that something is true without knowing the details of the transaction.

One part is a public record of the transaction, and the other is a private record that is only visible to the sender and the receiver.\nZCash achieves privacy in a number of ways. Firstly, the public record is accessible only through a blockchain explorer \\u2014 and even then, only the amount of the transaction is visible. The public record also shows that the transaction was made on the ZCash blockchain, not on the blockchain of the company or organization using ZCash to transact.\nZCash also allows for shielded transactions, which are private transactions that are visible only to the sender, receiver and those they decide to share the details of the transaction with.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Zcash and Bitcoin \\u2013 similarities and differences\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies that allow users to control their own finances without the need for a bank or third party.

Bitcoin is also built on the PoW blockchain, but uses a simpler mining process that requires less computing power.\nZCash also allows for private transactions, as described above. Bitcoin does not provide this option, so all transactions are public. This means that every transaction made with Bitcoin is visible to every person on the blockchain. This can be a huge disadvantage for companies that need to keep their finances private.\nZCash also has a slightly different mining process that is not as energy-intensive as PoW mining.

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself.

These networks are most commonly seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they have many other uses as well.\nBlockchain technology has the potential to streamline almost any industry, from finance to retail to even healthcare.
