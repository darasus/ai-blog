It came under the Zerocash Protocol and was rebranded to ZCash later that year.\nZCash started trading on many exchanges shortly after, with its value fluctuating between $10 and $15 per coin.

While this is great for financial transactions, blockchain can also be used to secure sensitive information like medical records and contracts. In fact, recent research suggests that blockchain could be the solution to data privacy issues.\nUnfortunately, the details of blockchain are visible to everyone. This means that if your company or organization chooses to store sensitive information on a blockchain network, any hacker who gains access to that data would also be able to see exactly how the information is being used.\nThis can be disastrous, particularly in industries like healthcare that depend on strict privacy laws. In addition, some stakeholders may not want to share their data with the entire blockchain network.\nThis is where ZCash comes in. The currency allows users to encrypt their data so that only those involved in the transaction can see it. This is crucial for industries like healthcare that need to maintain strict data privacy laws.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How does ZCash Achieve Privacy?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash uses a concept called \\u201Czero knowledge proof\\u201D to achieve privacy. A zero knowledge proof means that someone can verify that something is true without knowing the details of the transaction. ZCash uses this concept to encrypt the details of a transaction \\u2014 sender, receiver, amount and other information.\nThis is done by splitting the transaction into two parts. One part is a public record of the transaction, and the other is a private record that is only visible to the sender and the receiver.\nZCash achieves privacy in a number of ways. Firstly, the public record is accessible only through a blockchain explorer \\u2014 and even then, only the amount of the transaction is visible. The public record also shows that the transaction was made on the ZCash blockchain, not on the blockchain of the company or organization using ZCash to transact.\nZCash also allows for shielded transactions, which are private transactions that are visible only to the sender, receiver and those they decide to share the details of the transaction with.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Zcash and Bitcoin \\u2013 similarities and differences\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies that allow users to control their own finances without the need for a bank or third party. However, there are some key differences between the two.\nZCash is built on the blockchain provided by Proof of Work (PoW), which relies on miners solving complex mathematical problems to add transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin is also built on the PoW blockchain, but uses a simpler mining process that requires less computing power.\nZCash also allows for private transactions, as described above. Bitcoin does not provide this option, so all transactions are public. This means that every transaction made with Bitcoin is visible to every person on the blockchain. This can be a huge disadvantage for companies that need to keep their finances private.\nZCash also has a slightly different mining process that is not as energy-intensive as PoW mining.

Both of these digital assets have also proven to be profitable for investors. But which is the better investment: Bitcoin or Ethereum?\nWith so many similarities between these two virtual currencies, it\\u2019s easy to see why some may wonder which one is more valuable. After all, both are built on blockchain technology; they are both available as a digital token; and they are both used as payment in some cases.\nHowever, when we take a deeper look at how these two different types of tokens operate and what sort of potential they have long-term, it becomes clearer which one is likely to be worth more money.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary. In this article, you\\u2019ll learn more about what Ethereum is and its unique benefits as well as potential challenges it faces going forward in adoption and development.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
