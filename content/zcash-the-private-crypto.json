It came under the Zerocash Protocol and was rebranded to ZCash later that year.\nZCash started trading on many exchanges shortly after, with its value fluctuating between $10 and $15 per coin.

While this is great for financial transactions, blockchain can also be used to secure sensitive information like medical records and contracts. In fact, recent research suggests that blockchain could be the solution to data privacy issues.\nUnfortunately, the details of blockchain are visible to everyone. This means that if your company or organization chooses to store sensitive information on a blockchain network, any hacker who gains access to that data would also be able to see exactly how the information is being used.\nThis can be disastrous, particularly in industries like healthcare that depend on strict privacy laws. In addition, some stakeholders may not want to share their data with the entire blockchain network.\nThis is where ZCash comes in. The currency allows users to encrypt their data so that only those involved in the transaction can see it.

One part is a public record of the transaction, and the other is a private record that is only visible to the sender and the receiver.\nZCash achieves privacy in a number of ways. Firstly, the public record is accessible only through a blockchain explorer \\u2014 and even then, only the amount of the transaction is visible. The public record also shows that the transaction was made on the ZCash blockchain, not on the blockchain of the company or organization using ZCash to transact.\nZCash also allows for shielded transactions, which are private transactions that are visible only to the sender, receiver and those they decide to share the details of the transaction with.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Zcash and Bitcoin \\u2013 similarities and differences\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`ZCash and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies that allow users to control their own finances without the need for a bank or third party.

Bitcoin is also built on the PoW blockchain, but uses a simpler mining process that requires less computing power.\nZCash also allows for private transactions, as described above. Bitcoin does not provide this option, so all transactions are public. This means that every transaction made with Bitcoin is visible to every person on the blockchain. This can be a huge disadvantage for companies that need to keep their finances private.\nZCash also has a slightly different mining process that is not as energy-intensive as PoW mining.

While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators.

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
