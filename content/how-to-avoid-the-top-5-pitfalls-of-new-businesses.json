People are no longer confined to one desk or computer screen; they\\u2019re mobile, collaborative and constantly connected. That shift has meant that the ability to get things done quickly and efficiently is now a key marker of professional success.But what can you do to reach peak performance at work? If you\\u2019ve read anything about productivity in the last few years, you\\u2019ll probably know that it\\u2019s all about working smarter rather than harder.As professionals continue to be pushed further and faster by digital pressures, many are discovering that there is little time for process-driven productivity activities like lengthy meetings, email chains and excessive planning processes.Modern workplaces have responded by introducing activities that improve output and effectiveness \\u2014 particularly in the areas of exercise, mindfulness and nutrition \\u2014 as well as a range of other measures designed to give people more control over their lives outside of work.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Airlines have been hit hard as apprehensive travelers steer clear of travel. In addition to cancellations and red-eye flights, airlines are grappling with empty seats on normally packed flights, steep drops in ticket prices, and a burst of unused plane leases. To make matters worse, the pandemic has taken its toll on their bottom line.\nFor example, Travelers Insurance recently announced that it will no longer provide insurance coverage for overseas workers at influenza-stricken companies. As a result, some airlines have cut back or ceased all services to areas affected by the flu, while others have re-negotiated lease contracts to reduce costs.

However, there are also some downsides. Working from home means you are never really \"off\" as there will always be someone at home to answer calls, visitors knocking on the door or even delivery services coming to your address. It will also involve more responsibility than working for someone else as everything goes back to you.
