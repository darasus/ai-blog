summary: Kendrick Lamar has proven himself to be one of the best artists in
  music with each album release. His previous album, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” was
  praised for its fusion of hip-hop, jazz, and poetry. “Melodrama” the second
  album from New Zealand singer Lorde is a concept album about the experience of
  growing up in suburbia. Ed Sheeran’s third studio album has been critically
  praised  for its mature, varied sound.
intro: While there has been some great music released this year, the first half
  of 2018 has not been an exceptional one for new releases. However, that
  doesn’t mean there hasn’t been some brilliant albums released so far this
  year. While last year had some incredible albums (like Kendrick Lamar’s
  “Damn,” Lorde’s “Melodrama,” and Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds' "Who
  Built the Moon?"), this year hasn’t quite matched up to those standards.
  However, we are only halfway through the year and as such, we have also seen
  some fantastic new albums released in the last few months that are worth
  mentioning. There may not be many great new albums out at the moment – but
  these five are definitely among the best.
