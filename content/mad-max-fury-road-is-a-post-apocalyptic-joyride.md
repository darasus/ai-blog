In the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max: Fury Road, life is a joyride. The film follows Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a former cop who has become a wanderer in the wasteland, as he is drawn into the orbit of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a tyrannical ruler who controls the water and gasoline supplies in the area. When Joe's wife, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), attempts to flee with his harem of wives, Max finds himself caught up in the middle of her rebellion.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually stunning film, with stunning cinematography and production design. The action is non-stop, and the film is a thrill ride from start to finish. It's also a surprisingly feminist film, with Furiosa leading the charge against Joe's oppressive regime. Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating ride that is not to be missed.
