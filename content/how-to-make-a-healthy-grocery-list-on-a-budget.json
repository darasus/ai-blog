Given that healthy food is generally more expensive than junk food, many people find it difficult to eat well on a budget. In fact, a recent study found that American families with incomes below $40,000 spend about 11 percent of their income on groceries. That\\u2019s almost double the amount spent by households that earn more than $80,000 a year.\nFortunately, eating right doesn\\u2019t have to be an expensive proposition. With some planning and diligence, you can create cheap grocery lists on a regular basis and keep your household in peak nutritional condition while doing so. The first step is making smart shopping choices when you go to the store. Here are some tips to help you stock up on cheap groceries:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Be aware that some of these stores charge a premium for the convenience of their products and services.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Specialty grocery stores include farmers\\u2019 markets, health food stores, and discount grocers such as Aldi and Save-A-Lot.

These retailers often sell produce, meat, and dairy products significantly below the prices of conventional stores. If you\\u2019re willing to do a little research, you can find a number of great stores in your area.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when shopping at discount grocers. First, you\\u2019ll need to do some planning and come up with cheap grocery lists. Discount grocers typically don\\u2019t have the same selection as full-service grocery stores, so you\\u2019ll have to stick to the staples.

This will significantly reduce your grocery bill since out-of-season produce is usually expensive and may not be as nutritious.\nYou can track produce prices and availability online. Some produce databases even let you filter your results by location, letting you know which produce is in season in your area. For example, if you want to buy apples, you might see that they\\u2019re in season from September to March.\nA word of advice: don\\u2019t assume that certain foods are always in season. For example, while tomatoes are in season during the summer months, they\\u2019re not typically in season in the winter.\nIf you have a garden, there\\u2019s no easier way to save money on food than by growing your own.

Frozen produce can be very healthy, especially when it\\u2019s frozen soon after it\\u2019s harvested.\nThere are many advantages to buying frozen produce. For starters, frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh produce. Frozen fruits and vegetables are processed at their peak ripeness, which means they have more vitamins and minerals than their fresh counterparts. Plus, frozen produce comes with a long shelf life, so you can store it in your pantry. That can be helpful if you forget to go to the store.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are a few things to keep in mind when buying frozen produce.

Before you plan your next shopping trip, think about the types of foods you like to eat.\nTake into account anything that\\u2019s in season, and any special events that may call for certain foods.

Whether in a home, restaurant, cafeteria or any other eatery, almost all food establishments serve high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat meals that are laden with salt and unhealthy oils.What is unfortunate about this situation is that many people have no choice but to eat this way on a regular basis. If you work in an office, it\\u2019s highly likely that your building has its own kitchen where a catered lunch service prepares hot lunches for staff every day. Similarly, if you go to school, there will most likely be a canteen serving the same type of unhealthy food as an adult educational institution.The good news is that even if you are stuck eating these foods on a daily basis, you can make your kitchen a healthier place by altering what goes into the meals you cook at home and the ones that you buy.

However, there are ways to make your food dollars go further and still eat well.\nInstead of making weekly trips to multiple stores and markets, plan a shopping day and hit one store at a time. Look for sales in that store before you go and stock up on foods that are good value. You might even consider investing in a membership card or becoming an insider or club member so you get vouchers or other discounts. Adding your own spin on some classic cheap meals will also help you save money without sacrificing nutrition. It just takes some planning and research to make it work!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
