That\\u2019s almost double the amount spent by households that earn more than $80,000 a year.\nFortunately, eating right doesn\\u2019t have to be an expensive proposition.

These retailers often sell produce, meat, and dairy products significantly below the prices of conventional stores. If you\\u2019re willing to do a little research, you can find a number of great stores in your area.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when shopping at discount grocers. First, you\\u2019ll need to do some planning and come up with cheap grocery lists. Discount grocers typically don\\u2019t have the same selection as full-service grocery stores, so you\\u2019ll have to stick to the staples.

This will significantly reduce your grocery bill since out-of-season produce is usually expensive and may not be as nutritious.\nYou can track produce prices and availability online. Some produce databases even let you filter your results by location, letting you know which produce is in season in your area. For example, if you want to buy apples, you might see that they\\u2019re in season from September to March.\nA word of advice: don\\u2019t assume that certain foods are always in season. For example, while tomatoes are in season during the summer months, they\\u2019re not typically in season in the winter.\nIf you have a garden, there\\u2019s no easier way to save money on food than by growing your own.

For starters, frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh produce. Frozen fruits and vegetables are processed at their peak ripeness, which means they have more vitamins and minerals than their fresh counterparts. Plus, frozen produce comes with a long shelf life, so you can store it in your pantry.
