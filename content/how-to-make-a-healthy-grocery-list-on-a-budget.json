Given that healthy food is generally more expensive than junk food, many people find it difficult to eat well on a budget. In fact, a recent study found that American families with incomes below $40,000 spend about 11 percent of their income on groceries. That\\u2019s almost double the amount spent by households that earn more than $80,000 a year.\nFortunately, eating right doesn\\u2019t have to be an expensive proposition. With some planning and diligence, you can create cheap grocery lists on a regular basis and keep your household in peak nutritional condition while doing so. The first step is making smart shopping choices when you go to the store. Here are some tips to help you stock up on cheap groceries:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Be aware that some of these stores charge a premium for the convenience of their products and services.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Specialty grocery stores include farmers\\u2019 markets, health food stores, and discount grocers such as Aldi and Save-A-Lot.

First, you\\u2019ll need to do some planning and come up with cheap grocery lists. Discount grocers typically don\\u2019t have the same selection as full-service grocery stores, so you\\u2019ll have to stick to the staples.

This will significantly reduce your grocery bill since out-of-season produce is usually expensive and may not be as nutritious.\nYou can track produce prices and availability online. Some produce databases even let you filter your results by location, letting you know which produce is in season in your area. For example, if you want to buy apples, you might see that they\\u2019re in season from September to March.\nA word of advice: don\\u2019t assume that certain foods are always in season. For example, while tomatoes are in season during the summer months, they\\u2019re not typically in season in the winter.\nIf you have a garden, there\\u2019s no easier way to save money on food than by growing your own.

Frozen produce can be very healthy, especially when it\\u2019s frozen soon after it\\u2019s harvested.\nThere are many advantages to buying frozen produce. For starters, frozen produce is often cheaper than fresh produce. Frozen fruits and vegetables are processed at their peak ripeness, which means they have more vitamins and minerals than their fresh counterparts. Plus, frozen produce comes with a long shelf life, so you can store it in your pantry. That can be helpful if you forget to go to the store.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are a few things to keep in mind when buying frozen produce.

Before you plan your next shopping trip, think about the types of foods you like to eat.\nTake into account anything that\\u2019s in season, and any special events that may call for certain foods.
