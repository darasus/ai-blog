The Korean sextet has made a name for itself as not just another boy band but one that plays its own instruments and has choreographed dance routines that are so intricate they sometimes require special stage lighting.\nArmed with these weapons, BTS has twice cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart with its Love Yourself series. And the latest installment of this series \\u2014 which doubles as its sixth EP \\u2014 is no exception.\nFurthermore, it\\u2019s the strongest of the bunch.\nIt\\u2019s impossible to talk about BTS without mentioning their massive following beyond Korea: Vivid, obsessive ARMYs (as they call them) who follow their every move and buy everything associated with them. This is why many people assume they are only famous because of social media and pandering ads (which is true). However, anyone who listens to their music will tell you that they deserve all this success. \\u201CLove Yourself: Tear\\u201D proves it once again.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This might seem as just another case of annoying Hollywood over-simplification: after all, we get so many bioengineered super-geniuses with computer uplink implants that they can become trapped in remote locations via their own stupidity.

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
