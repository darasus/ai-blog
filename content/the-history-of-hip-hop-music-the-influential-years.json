The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

But there are still some great pop albums that aren\\u2019t filled with auto-tune and EDM drops.On May 25th, the Scottish band Chvrches released their third album called \\u201C Love is Dead.\\u201D The synth-pop band has lots of happy vibes and catchy hooks on their new album. It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Today, there are more ways than ever to access and enjoy hip-hop music; from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to video sharing sites like YouTube, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
