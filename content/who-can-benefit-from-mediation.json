It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes.

And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.
