It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes. Unlike arbitration, mediation isn\\u2019t binding, which means that if you choose to continue with litigation after mediation, you will not be precluded from doing so. And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.

It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
