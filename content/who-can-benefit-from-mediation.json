The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature.

If you take the time to understand what motivates them and reward them for good behavior, they will respond by trying harder next time.\nIf you're willing to put in the time and effort, almost any dog can be trained to sit on command. It's just a matter of identifying your dog\\u2019s motivation and rewarding him for the behaviors that you like. With consistent training sessions every day or two, your dog will learn how to sit in no time at all.\nTraining your dog doesn\\u2019t have to be difficult or stressful \\u2013 it just requires commitment and patience from both of you. The more straightforward training techniques like marker words, positive reinforcement and treat rewards should get your dog responding obediently within a few weeks.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
