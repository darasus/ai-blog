  "summary": "Mediation allows divorcing couples to discuss and negotiate issues such as child custody and child support, spousal support, distribution of assets, and even potential modifications to the terms of their premarital agreement. In many states, couples must attend mediation before they can have a civil court proceeding. Mediation is an incredibly flexible process that can be adapted to suit the needs of the parties involved. It allows each side to be heard while encouraging them to listen to the other party, too.",

It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes. Unlike arbitration, mediation isn\\u2019t binding, which means that if you choose to continue with litigation after mediation, you will not be precluded from doing so. And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.

Mediation allows divorcing couples to discuss and negotiate issues such as child custody and child support, spousal support, distribution of assets, and even potential modifications to the terms of their premarital agreement. Going through mediation together can help spouses work together in a neutral environment to come up with solutions that feel mutually beneficial. Moreover, mediation reduces the risk of an expensive and drawn-out court battle. In fact, in many states, couples must attend mediation before they can have a civil court proceeding.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"People Facing Job Loss Or Layoff\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re an employee who\\u2019s worried about losing your job, or a company that needs to downsize, mediation can help you resolve any issues that might arise out of this difficult situation. If you\\u2019re an employee and you\\u2019re worried you\\u2019ll soon be fired, mediation can help you negotiate a smooth exit. You and your employer can use the mediation process to discuss your future, including topics such as when you will be leaving the company, how much you will be paid, and whether you will be offered a reference letter.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"People With Disabilities Or Illness\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re an employee who has a disability or medical condition that prevents you from fulfilling certain job responsibilities, you may need to negotiate an \\u201Cinability agreement\\u201D with your employer.

Mediation can help you and your employer reach an agreement that respects your needs while ensuring the employer retains the ability to run a successful business.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Individuals Who Have Been The Victims Of Abuse\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"People who have experienced domestic violence or have been abused by a family member or friend often have a hard time negotiating solutions to their situation. In these cases, mediation can help these individuals remove themselves from the environment of abuse while still maintaining control of their situation.
