The phenomenon of social consciousness is becoming more apparent and accessible to everyone, and it\\u2019s now easier than ever to understand the ethical and environmental implications of our actions.\nEven though most people are now aware of the role that climate change plays in destroying the planet and reducing its biodiversity, very few are taking actionable steps to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing waste and using cleaner energy. In addition to this, there is no singular answer or solution to reversing the effects of pollution on our home planet; rather, it will require an amalgamation of many different initiatives working together simultaneously.\nOne such initiative is veganism. A plant-based diet has a number of positive benefits on the environment \\u2014 mainly because raising livestock produces a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. If we all stopped eating meat it would have a huge effect on carbon dioxide levels, deforestation rates, and natural water courses.\nAs you\\u2019ll discover from reading this article, veganism could be the answer to climate change; however, there are also some drawbacks.
