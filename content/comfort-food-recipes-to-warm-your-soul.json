Eating fruits and veggies can help you meet your daily needs for vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients.

In addition to being an excellent source of vitamins A and K as well as several B vitamins, fruits are also a great source of fiber.\nIn general the best time to eat seasonal fruits is during their peak season.

If so, you\\u2019re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. However, not all types of fish have the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of your diet.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
