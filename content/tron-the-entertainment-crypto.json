Based on its blockchain network and unique TRX coin, Tron offers users a wide range of services including gaming and gambling, social media, and more. For a more in-depth look at what Tron does and how it works, keep reading.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Tron was developed by Justin Sun, a Chinese entrepreneur and former Ripple representative who has been working in the blockchain world since 2010. The idea behind Tron is to provide entertainment \\u2014 both content and the process of acquiring and enjoying it \\u2014 through the blockchain. The company\\u2019s official website describes it as a \\u201Cdecentralized ecosystem for the global digital entertainment industry.\\u201D The company, which has a team of over 100 employees, has set a goal of becoming the \\u201Clargest decentralized Internet ecosystem.\\u201D\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Decentralization?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Decentralization is associated almost exclusively with the crypto industry, but what is decentralized technology and how does it differ from normal technology? In a nutshell, decentralization is the process of distributing power away from a central authority and giving it to a network of people or other entities. To put it another way, decentralization is not controlled by a single person or entity, but by a community. It\\u2019s how companies like Uber and Airbnb, for example, operate. Users are given the freedom to decide when, where, and how much they want to drive for the service. Hosts set their own rules for renting out their spaces. The centralized authority, in this case the company management, only steps in when necessary.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Does Tron Work?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As the digital world continues to grow and evolve, so, too, do the ways in which we entertain ourselves.

The partnership\\u2019s goal is to create a more \\u201Cincentivized and decentralized Internet\\u201D through the creation of an Internet of Volumes (IoV).\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The company has also partnered with the Chinese blockchain giant Fenbushi Capital, as well as several Chinese companies and investors.
