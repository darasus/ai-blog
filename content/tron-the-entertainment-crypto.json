In a nutshell, decentralization is the process of distributing power away from a central authority and giving it to a network of people or other entities. To put it another way, decentralization is not controlled by a single person or entity, but by a community. It\\u2019s how companies like Uber and Airbnb, for example, operate. Users are given the freedom to decide when, where, and how much they want to drive for the service. Hosts set their own rules for renting out their spaces.

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software! In this article we will be exploring Bitcoin forks: More specifically, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This means there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.\nThe creation of Bitcoin led to the emergence of many other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) with their own unique features and uses. As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\nThere are a number of factors that could continue to drive demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
