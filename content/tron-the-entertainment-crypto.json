In a nutshell, decentralization is the process of distributing power away from a central authority and giving it to a network of people or other entities. To put it another way, decentralization is not controlled by a single person or entity, but by a community. It\\u2019s how companies like Uber and Airbnb, for example, operate. Users are given the freedom to decide when, where, and how much they want to drive for the service. Hosts set their own rules for renting out their spaces.
