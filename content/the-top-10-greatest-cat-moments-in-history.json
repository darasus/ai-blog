They\\u2019re enigmatic creatures with a reputation for being aloof and independent; they don\\u2019t ask for much and they keep very little as repayment.

Somehow, they discovered a burning curiosity for tobacco, and \\u2013 like a true cat \\u2013 would get high by chewing on the leaves.\nBut tobacco was at the time a luxury item that had been drawn into the world of commerce and trade, so it was kept out of reach of human fingers. Cats, however, have been known to chew on almost anything.

They kept the ship free of vermin and other pests, so they were generally welcomed with open arms.
