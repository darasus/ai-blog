Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill. It can also be tricky because it requires reading your dog and anticipating their behavior. If they haven\\u2019t jumped yet, will they leap again? Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
