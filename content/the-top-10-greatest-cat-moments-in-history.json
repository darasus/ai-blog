Sorry to burst your bubble, but even the cutest cat in the world would struggle to compete with some of these feline friends when it comes to making an impact on human history...\nCats have been a constant companion of humans for thousands of years. They\\u2019re enigmatic creatures with a reputation for being aloof and independent; they don\\u2019t ask for much and they keep very little as repayment. But cats demand something intangible from their owners: companionship.

Cats are naturally curious and mischievous creatures, and they\\u2019re often drawn to the things that humans consider dangerous. During the 16th century, when tobacco was imported and traded as a commodity, cats were a common sight in warehouses and trading ships. Somehow, they discovered a burning curiosity for tobacco, and \\u2013 like a true cat \\u2013 would get high by chewing on the leaves.\nBut tobacco was at the time a luxury item that had been drawn into the world of commerce and trade, so it was kept out of reach of human fingers. Cats, however, have been known to chew on almost anything. This led to tobacco being harvested and prepared in a way that made it more accessible to paws.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Tubby Tabby enjoys a snack\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Cats have adopted humans as their primary source of food for millennia, but this dependence on humans for survival has made them more than just evolutionary partners \\u2013 it has made them a part of human culture.

In Japanese culture, the fish is a symbol of prosperity and growth, so it is a gift that is expected whenever someone pays a visit \\u2013 even if they\\u2019re just dropping by to do some business.\nBut the Japanese have a tradition of serving guests with a side dish of 9-tailed, 1-eyed, 2-legged, 3-souls, 4-winged, 5-coloured, 6-legged, 7-coloured, 8-winged, 9-coloured tabby cat.

It\\u2019s fascinating to observe how a species that is supposed to be solitary and independent is somehow able to come together en masse and create a subculture that enables them to live among humans. Cats have been present in the United States since its earliest days, and many have become the stuff of urban legends throughout the years, especially in the context of the American dream \\u2013 a dream that has become synonymous with the idea that anyone can make it.\nSome cats have even been able to rise above the rest and achieve celebrity status. One of the most famous examples of this is the cat who appeared in the famous painting \\u201CAmerican Gothic\\u201D.

This period of time was largely defined by the spread of disease, famine, and wars that caused widespread death and destruction. But some cats were able to rise above this darkness and use their powers for good.\nDuring the Middle Ages, cats were often found on trading ships. They kept the ship free of vermin and other pests, so they were generally welcomed with open arms. When ships from England began travelling to the New World, they brought cats with them to keep the ships free from pests.
