Fortunately, after meeting with producer Rich Costey (M83, Blond Redhead) who helped him record some demos, things fell into place.

Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends).
