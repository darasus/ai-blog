  "intro": "In the aftermath of the whirlwind that was 2017, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that hip-hop music is the most important genre in contemporary culture. Today, there are more ways than ever to access and enjoy hip-hop music; from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to video sharing sites like YouTube, SoundCloud and Vimeo. Indeed, it’s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish? \nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world…",
  "content": "## Wordplay is at the heart of hip-hop\n\nWhether it’s a clever pun or an alliterative rhyme, wordplay is at the very core of hip-hop culture. The genre’s lyrics are littered with smart metaphors, witty similes and references to pop culture; all of which only make the music more enjoyable.\nA big part of the attraction of hip-hop is the fact that any youth with a microphone and a decent amount of creativity can become a rapper. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the English language can learn to create rhymes, and there are plenty of free resources online that can help you get started.\nEven though not everyone can be a professional lyricist, an appreciation of hip-hop requires nothing more than an open mind and a willingness to see things from a different perspective. Rap music is one of the most creative forms of art and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\n## Hip hop has a rich history\n\nHip-hop has been around since the 1970s, when the first breakbeats were created by DJs. These tracks were interspersed with rhyming couplets, and so hip-hop was born.\nThis first iteration of the subculture was very much a product of its surroundings. It arose in New York, one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world. As a result, hip-hop was a melting pot of different cultures, bringing together African-American and Latino youth with elements of Jamaican reggae and British youth culture.\nYou can see this rich history in hip-hop’s fashion and artwork. The vibrant, energetic style of the genre draws from a variety of different cultures, with vibrant colors and bold patterns being staples of the scene.\n\n## It’s inherently African-American\n\nOne of the things that makes hip-hop so special is the fact that it is a predominantly African-American form of art. It is a product of a specific culture and draws on the history and experiences of black Americans in a way that no other genre does.\nThere is a certain pride that comes with being part of a culture that has endured such racist prejudices and oppression. It’s a reminder that no matter how much governments or the media try to sweep it under the rug, African-American culture will always be there to assert its presence.\nBecause hip-hop is so associated with black culture, the genre has been a target for the racist attitudes of some. But the scene has always fought back against oppression, with many rappers using their art as a means of raising awareness about social issues.\n\n## It’s non-commercial and underground\n\nAs a predominantly non-commercial form of music, hip-hop is not driven by profit. It’s not connected to any record company, and it’s not on a mission to make as much money as possible. It’s an underground, non-profit scene that is driven by creativity.\nAll those fancy stadiums and million-dollar sponsorship deals don’t apply to hip-hop. The concerts remain small, accessible affairs and the rappers remain independent artists.\nAnd this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the genre is so appealing. It is a refreshing change from the glossy, overproduced tunes that make up the majority of the music scene. The lyrics are not censored, and the artists have the freedom to talk about the things that matter to them.\nIndeed, many hip-hop artists are true revolutionaries – using music as a means of spreading awareness about important social issues.\n\n## It can be an empowering force for youth\n\nHip-hop has always been a voice for the young people of society. It is a genre that exists because they exist; a vibrant subculture that has helped millions of young people feel more empowered and connected.\nThe lyrics speak to teens and young adults on a level that other forms of media simply can’t reach. The language is accessible, the themes are relevant and the tunes are irresistible.\nBecause hip-hop is so youth-centered, it has played an important role in the lives of many young people. It’s a space that is open to all, with no entry requirements or age restrictions.\nIndeed, hip-hop is so important to so many people that some have suggested that it could be a unifying force for youth across the globe – providing a way for disenfranchised youth to interact with each other and raise awareness about their issues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. The genre’s lyrics are littered with smart metaphors, witty similes and references to pop culture; all of which only make the music more enjoyable.\nHip hop has been around since the 1970s, when the first breakbeats were created by DJs. This first iteration of the subculture was very much a product of its surroundings; a melting pot of different cultures that drew influence from reggae, British youth culture and gospel music.\nHip hop is inherently African-American, a non-commercial form of music that is accessible to all. It has played an important role in the lives of many young people, and has the potential to be a unifying force for youth across the globe."
