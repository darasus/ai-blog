Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the English language can learn to create rhymes, and there are plenty of free resources online that can help you get started.\nEven though not everyone can be a professional lyricist, an appreciation of hip-hop requires nothing more than an open mind and a willingness to see things from a different perspective.

It arose in New York, one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world. As a result, hip-hop was a melting pot of different cultures, bringing together African-American and Latino youth with elements of Jamaican reggae and British youth culture.\nYou can see this rich history in hip-hop\\u2019s fashion and artwork.

It\\u2019s a reminder that no matter how much governments or the media try to sweep it under the rug, African-American culture will always be there to assert its presence.\nBecause hip-hop is so associated with black culture, the genre has been a target for the racist attitudes of some.

It\\u2019s an underground, non-profit scene that is driven by creativity.\nAll those fancy stadiums and million-dollar sponsorship deals don\\u2019t apply to hip-hop. The concerts remain small, accessible affairs and the rappers remain independent artists.\nAnd this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the genre is so appealing. It is a refreshing change from the glossy, overproduced tunes that make up the majority of the music scene. The lyrics are not censored, and the artists have the freedom to talk about the things that matter to them.\nIndeed, many hip-hop artists are true revolutionaries \\u2013 using music as a means of spreading awareness about important social issues.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"It can be an empowering force for youth\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Hip-hop has always been a voice for the young people of society.

The language is accessible, the themes are relevant and the tunes are irresistible.\nBecause hip-hop is so youth-centered, it has played an important role in the lives of many young people. It\\u2019s a space that is open to all, with no entry requirements or age restrictions.\nIndeed, hip-hop is so important to so many people that some have suggested that it could be a unifying force for youth across the globe \\u2013 providing a way for disenfranchised youth to interact with each other and raise awareness about their issues.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Hip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock.

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
