Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the English language can learn to create rhymes, and there are plenty of free resources online that can help you get started.\nEven though not everyone can be a professional lyricist, an appreciation of hip-hop requires nothing more than an open mind and a willingness to see things from a different perspective.

These tracks were interspersed with rhyming couplets, and so hip-hop was born.\nThis first iteration of the subculture was very much a product of its surroundings. It arose in New York, one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world. As a result, hip-hop was a melting pot of different cultures, bringing together African-American and Latino youth with elements of Jamaican reggae and British youth culture.\nYou can see this rich history in hip-hop\\u2019s fashion and artwork.

It\\u2019s a reminder that no matter how much governments or the media try to sweep it under the rug, African-American culture will always be there to assert its presence.\nBecause hip-hop is so associated with black culture, the genre has been a target for the racist attitudes of some.

The concerts remain small, accessible affairs and the rappers remain independent artists.\nAnd this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the genre is so appealing. It is a refreshing change from the glossy, overproduced tunes that make up the majority of the music scene.
