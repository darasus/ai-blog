Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of the English language can learn to create rhymes, and there are plenty of free resources online that can help you get started.\nEven though not everyone can be a professional lyricist, an appreciation of hip-hop requires nothing more than an open mind and a willingness to see things from a different perspective.

It arose in New York, one of the largest and most diverse cities in the world. As a result, hip-hop was a melting pot of different cultures, bringing together African-American and Latino youth with elements of Jamaican reggae and British youth culture.\nYou can see this rich history in hip-hop\\u2019s fashion and artwork.

It is a product of a specific culture and draws on the history and experiences of black Americans in a way that no other genre does.\nThere is a certain pride that comes with being part of a culture that has endured such racist prejudices and oppression. It\\u2019s a reminder that no matter how much governments or the media try to sweep it under the rug, African-American culture will always be there to assert its presence.\nBecause hip-hop is so associated with black culture, the genre has been a target for the racist attitudes of some.

It\\u2019s an underground, non-profit scene that is driven by creativity.\nAll those fancy stadiums and million-dollar sponsorship deals don\\u2019t apply to hip-hop. The concerts remain small, accessible affairs and the rappers remain independent artists.\nAnd this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the genre is so appealing. It is a refreshing change from the glossy, overproduced tunes that make up the majority of the music scene. The lyrics are not censored, and the artists have the freedom to talk about the things that matter to them.\nIndeed, many hip-hop artists are true revolutionaries \\u2013 using music as a means of spreading awareness about important social issues.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"It can be an empowering force for youth\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Hip-hop has always been a voice for the young people of society.

The language is accessible, the themes are relevant and the tunes are irresistible.\nBecause hip-hop is so youth-centered, it has played an important role in the lives of many young people.

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them.
