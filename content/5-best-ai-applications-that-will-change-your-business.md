summary: Artificial intelligence is the science of building machines that can do
  things that normally require human intellect. Natural language processing,
  computer vision, and machine learning are examples of AI. AI has the potential
  to change how we do our jobs, how we interact with businesses, and how
  businesses make money. Whether AI will help or harm humanity is a topic that
  has generated debate for decades. Some people have expressed concern that AI
  could end up controlling people. Others have argued that it could greatly
  increase human abilities and improve society.
intro: >-
  If you need proof that artificial intelligence has become ingrained in
  our daily lives, just look at the buzz around virtual assistants like Alexa,
  Siri, and Cortana. These AI helpers are no longer just for tech-savvy adults;
  now, kids as young as five are happily chattering away with cartoon characters
  like Waffle the Blue Whale or Hank the Crab whenever they need help with
  something. 

  However, AI isn’t solely limited to helpful sea creatures or talking speakers. In fact, AI is being used for all kinds of purposes – from self-driving cars to replacing call center agents with intelligent chatbots. Even businesses are seeing the value in incorporating AI into their day-to-day operations. From automating processes to making data-driven decisions faster, businesses of all sizes can leverage the benefits of AI in order to improve their services and workflows.

## What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the science of building machines that can do things that normally require human intellect, such as understanding context, making decisions, and learning new things. Natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning are a few examples of AI. AI is already in use in companies like Google and Amazon. It’s used to help us search the web, shop, and translate languages. AI has the potential to change how we do our jobs, how we interact with businesses, and how businesses make money.

AI and related technologies are expected to have an enormous impact on society in the years ahead, as computers that can “think” and “learn” become vastly more sophisticated than they are today. Whether AI will help or harm humanity is a topic that has generated debate for decades. Some people have expressed concern that AI could end up controlling people. Others have argued that AI could greatly increase human abilities and improve society.

## Data-driven decisions

AI can help businesses become more data-driven by collecting and analysing large amounts of data at high speeds. It can then make predictions based on past data, recommend courses of action based on the data, or make decisions based on the data.
In order to leverage the benefits of AI, businesses should track their data in one place – no matter whether it comes from internal systems, apps, customer feedback surveys, emails, or the internet.
Once your data is in one place, you can start to utilise AI tools that allow you to automatically identify patterns and insights that can help you make data-driven decisions. And since these tools are automated, they can save you time and resources while ensuring data is consistent and reliable. From predicting customer behaviour to optimising business operations, AI can help you make data-driven decisions.

## Automating business processes

Businesses can also use AI to streamline their operations and improve customer experience. It can collect, analyse, and interpret data to identify inefficiencies and suggest ways to fix them.
Similarly, AI can help automate repetitive tasks and maximise productivity by taking over tasks that employees find challenging, like data entry, content creation, and identifying trends in data.
If your business has a lot of data, manual processes, or tedious tasks that can be automated, AI can help.
At the same time, the IT department can keep the human element in business by partnering AI with human employees. With AI deployed as an intelligent assistant, companies can leverage the benefits of automation without losing their human touch.

## AI-powered collaboration

In today’s digital world, businesses are increasingly connected to partners, suppliers, and customers. AI solutions have made it easier to automate communication and enhance business relationships. You can use AI to do everything from scheduling meeting times to managing customer interactions.
With AI-powered collaboration, businesses can connect with customers and partners through intelligent apps, chatbots, and virtual assistants. This can help companies better serve their customers by making information accessible at any time. It can also help increase productivity by reducing the amount of time employees spend communicating with customers and partners.
At the same time, AI tools can help business leaders make better decisions by providing data at their fingertips. They can collect and analyse data to identify problems, find trends, and make recommendations.

## AI for lead generation and lead scoring

Businesses that want to increase their leads and sales can leverage the power of AI. It can collect and analyse data to identify customers and provide insights that businesses can use to personalise their approach to each customer.
It can also be used to improve lead generation by automatically identifying what customers are interested in and what information they need to make purchasing decisions.
And when it comes to scoring leads, AI can help businesses identify which leads are most likely to buy their products or services.

## AI for customer service and support

AI can also be used to improve customer service and support by collecting and analysing data to identify common problems and provide solutions. And it can be used to automate and simplify customer interactions, such as scheduling appointments, answering common questions, and resolving issues.
At the same time, businesses can use AI to gather customer feedback that can be used to improve products and services.

## AI for predictive analytics

Lastly, AI can help businesses make better decisions by providing data at their fingertips. It can collect and analyse data to identify problems, find trends, and make recommendations. AI can be used to optimize business operations and make better predictions about future needs based on current activities.
However, businesses should keep in mind that AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s critical to find the AI solution that best fits your organisation.

## Conclusion

Artificial intelligence is here and it’s changing how we do business. In fact, it’s already responsible for managing thousands of business systems and helping companies make millions of dollars every day. From automating business processes to making data-driven decisions, AI is impacting every industry and reshaping how businesses operate.
For businesses that want to use artificial intelligence, the first step is gathering data. With AI, data is the foundation and businesses need to make sure they’re collecting, analysing, and interpreting it correctly.
Once businesses have the data they need, they can start implementing AI tools. From algorithms that manage assets to AI-powered collaboration, businesses will see benefits from AI almost immediately. And with new AI solutions emerging every day, businesses have a lot of options to choose from.
