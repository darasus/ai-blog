It can be super easy to fall into a routine when you\\u2019re spending so much time with each other. You go to work, come home, and then retreat to your respective rooms for the rest of the night. And while that routine is totally normal and understandable at this stage in your relationship, it might not be exactly what you\\u2019re looking for.\nIt\\u2019s easy to get jealous or resentful if your partner is always on their computer \\u2014 but that doesn\\u2019t mean that there isn\\u2019t a reason for their constant use of it. It could be that they are really passionate about something they\\u2019re researching online or maybe they have an online business venture they\\u2019ve been working on for a while now. However, if this is causing tension between you two, speak up! They may not even realize how much time they spend on their computer and just how much of an impact it has on your relationship.
