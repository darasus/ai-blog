It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.

From concerns over online safety to the amount of time kids spend looking at screens, digital parenting presents its own unique set of challenges.\nAs technology continues to advance, so do the ways in which our kids can interact with it. From tablets and smart TVs to smartphones and video games, it seems as though there are more screens than ever before. This is especially true for younger children who have grown up with these devices as a normal part of their everyday life.\nThe pros and cons of screen time for kids can be debated endlessly but at the end of the day, your child will likely spend a lot of their time consuming some form of media in one way or another. As their parent, it\\u2019s important that you understand the benefits and risks associated with screen time so that you can make informed decisions about how much exposure they receive on a regular basis.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
