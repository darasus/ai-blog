Even if you don\\u2019t like going out or meeting new people, there are endless opportunities online, which makes staying in shape even harder. Keeping fit is not an easy task in this modern world but it doesn\\u2019t mean it is impossible! You just need to find the right motivation to get started and keep going.\nA lot of people give up on their New Year\\u2019s resolutions before they even begin, because they don\\u2019t have a plan of action and fail to consider what will keep them motivated along the way.
