## Make a plan

Planning is key to making one-dish chicken recipes successful. You’ll have a better chance at sticking to your meal plan if you have one dish that can be paired with a number of different sides. Plan to eat the same thing for a few days in a row and then switch it up again with something different.
One-dish chicken recipes are also a great way to use up leftovers, so be sure to keep an eye out for those. They’re a great way to get a couple of extra meals from just one portion.

## Plan around your favourite dishes

Some dishes are better suited to one-dish cooking than others. Soups, stews and stir fries are a great option. They’re hearty, can be paired with just about any type of side and have a long shelf life if stored in the fridge properly.
Another favourite is pasta. It pairs easily with a number of different sauces and is best kept simple by adding just a bit of sauce, cheese or a few veggies.
When deciding on a dish, keep in mind the number of sides that it pairs best with and try to choose something that can be eaten with a variety of different sides. This will make meal planning easier and prevent you from getting bored with the same dish over and over again.

## Rotisserie chicken is your friend

Certain one-dish chicken recipes can be made with just a little bit of prep work. One of the best ways to cut down on the amount of time it takes to prepare a meal is to purchase ingredients ahead of time and keep them on hand.
One great example of this is roasting a whole chicken in the oven. It doesn’t take long to roast a chicken and it’s easy to do thanks to the fact that it’s already been portioned out for you.
You can then use the chicken in a number of different ways. Use it to top salads, add it to soups, make sandwiches out of it or use it to make a simple stir fry.

## Keep meals simple

One-dish chicken recipes don’t have to be complicated or fancy. In fact, keeping them as simple as possible is the best way to make sure they’re a part of your weekly routine.
Keep sauces and side dishes simple and go for just a couple of ingredients at most. It’s best to keep to flavour-boosting ingredients like herbs, lemon, salt and pepper over more complex items like spices.
Keeping things simple will make mealtime less stressful and help you avoid overcomplicating things. It will also make your one-dish chicken recipes suitable for nearly any type of diet thanks to their simplicity.

## Don’t be afraid of the freezer

If you’re really looking to start saving time in the kitchen, you might want to consider freezing your one-dish chicken recipes. It’s a great way to get a couple of extra meals out of just one and you can use them to make quick and easy meals at a later time.
One-dish chicken recipes work great when frozen and can be used in a number of different ways. You can freeze them in individual portions, whole, or in casserole form.
Freeze the leftovers from your one-dish meals and then thaw them out before reheating them in the microwave whenever you’re craving a quick and easy meal.

## Conclusion

One-dish chicken recipes are an excellent way of getting back to basics in the kitchen. They’re easy to prepare, are perfect for using up leftovers, and are great for packing lunches for the family too.
One-dish chicken recipes also make for quick and easy weeknight dinners that both kids and adults will love. They’re hearty, packed with flavour, and are great for using up ingredients that are already in the fridge.
One-dish chicken recipes are also a great way to get more vegetables into your diet, and they work great for almost any type of diet thanks to their simplicity and ease of preparation.
