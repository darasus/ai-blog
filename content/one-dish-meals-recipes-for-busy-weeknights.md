## Why one-dish meals are popular?

One-dish meals are so popular because they are easy to make, healthy and delicious. They can be prepared with a few basic ingredients and they make a complete meal when served with a side of rice or baked potato. Also, one-dish meals are usually very budget-friendly because you can use ingredients that are available in your pantry or fridge. A major advantage of one-dish meals is that you can make a large batch and store it in the fridge for a few days. They can be served as leftovers for lunch or dinner. With so many benefits, it is no surprise that one-dish meals are gaining popularity among working people who are looking for quick, healthy and affordable dinner recipes.
