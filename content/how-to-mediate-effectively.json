      "summary": "Mediation allows divorcing couples to discuss and negotiate issues such as child custody and child support, spousal support, distribution of assets, and even potential modifications to the terms of their premarital agreement. In many states, couples must attend mediation before they can have a civil court proceeding. Mediation is an incredibly flexible process that can be adapted to suit the needs of the parties involved. It allows each side to be heard while encouraging them to listen to the other party, too.",

      "summary": "Mediation involves a discussion of the issues in dispute, assists with brainstorming possible solutions, and helps the parties reach a settlement. Mediation does not impose a solution on the parties; the parties must agree to the terms of any settlement. The parties' attorneys can be present, but they don't participate in the mediation itself. The mediation process begins with an assessment by the mediator to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each partyâ€™s position. The mediator uses various mediation tools and techniques to facilitate communication between the parties. Mediation is collaborative, flexible, and can be modified to accommodate the partiesâ€™ schedules.",

The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have.
