## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them.

The first block in a blockchain consists of a header, a transaction list, and a hash pointer. The header includes information about the block, such as the block’s hash (a unique identifier), the block’s timestamp, and the block’s size. The transaction list includes information about each transaction included in the block, such as the transaction’s hash (a unique identifier), the transaction’s timestamp, the transaction’s type (whether it is a transfer of cryptocurrency or another type of transaction), the transaction’s recipient (the blockchain address of the person or entity that receives the transaction), and the transaction’s amount (the amount transferred). The hash pointer consists of a hash of the previous block’s header.
