The potential of blockchain technology is often compared to that of the internet in the 1990s. While the internet created a global platform for information exchange, blockchain has the potential to do the same for value. By enabling peer-to-peer payments, the blockchain could help reduce the cost of transactions and make it easier for people to conduct business with each other.

In addition to its potential to reduce transaction costs, blockchain technology could also help to reduce fraudulent activities. Because each transaction is recorded on a public ledger, it would be difficult for someone to commit fraud by creating a false transaction. This could have a major impact on businesses, which lose billions of dollars each year to fraud.

Another potential benefit of blockchain technology is its ability to help create new economic opportunities. For example, blockchain could be used to create a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling energy. This could allow people to buy and sell energy from each other, without the need for a central authority.

Finally, blockchain technology has the potential to make a positive impact on society more broadly. By making it easier for people to conduct business with each other and by reducing fraudulent activities, blockchain could help to create a more efficient and fair economy. In addition, by creating new economic opportunities, blockchain could help to reduce poverty and inequality.
