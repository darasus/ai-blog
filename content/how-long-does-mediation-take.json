Mediation can be useful where there are multiple parties, a lot of money on the line, and/or complex issues of law and fact that need to be worked out.

Mediation can be useful where there are multiple parties, a lot of money on the line, and/or complex issues of law and fact that need to be worked out. Complex cases can often get stuck in court, but mediation provides an alternative path towards resolution that avoids the expense and time of a drawn-out trial.\nIn complex cases, mediation is often a multi-session process. The mediator will help the parties work towards a solution that works for everyone, but it may take more than one session to get there.\nFor example, mediation for a contentious divorce could take several sessions over the course of several months with attorneys and accountants present.
