If you're someone who emotional eats, you're not alone. Emotional eating is a real thing and it can be tough to overcome. But there are ways to do it! Here are some tips on how to overcome emotional eating: 

1. Be aware of your triggers. What are the things that trigger you to emotional eat? Is it boredom? Stress? Sadness? Once you know your triggers, you can start to work on avoiding them.

2. Find other ways to cope with your emotions. If you're bored, find something else to do. If you're stressed, try some relaxation techniques. If you're sad, talk to a friend. There are many healthy ways to cope with emotions, and emotional eating should not be your go-to method.

3. Don't keep tempting foods in the house. If you know that you can't resist a certain food, don't keep it in the house! Out of sight, out of mind.

4. Give yourself permission to indulge sometimes. If you deny yourself all of your favorite foods, you're more likely to binge on them later. Allow yourself to have a treat every once in a while, but in moderation.

5. Find a support system. Whether it's a friend, family member, or online community, finding others who understand what you're going through can be helpful. They can offer support and advice on how to overcome emotional eating.
