## Understand The Root Cause Of Your Emotional Eating

Before you can start to break your emotional eating habits, it’s important to take time to understand the root cause behind your emotional eating. The following questions can help you gain a better understanding of why you eat when you’re feeling stressed or anxious. By reflecting on the positives and negatives of your current emotional eating habits, you can start to develop eating strategies that are more in line with your health and happiness goals.

- What situations regularly trigger you to turn to food?
- What do you typically eat during these situations?
- What emotions do you feel when you’re eating?
- What emotions do you feel when you’re not eating?
- What emotions would you like to feel in those situations instead?

## Create A Meal Ritual

Part of overcoming emotional eating is learning how to take control of your eating habits. You can start by creating a daily meal ritual that helps you to break the cycle of emotional eating and put you in a better mindset for making healthier food choices. Try a few of these tips as part of your meal ritual to help you break the emotional eating cycle.

- Eat breakfast: It’s a common belief that skipping breakfast is a good way to lose weight. In fact, research suggests that people who regularly eat breakfast are more successful at maintaining a healthy weight than those who don’t. So make sure to include a healthy breakfast in your meal ritual to kick start your day with a healthy eating kick-start.
- Take your time: Eating quickly can increase feelings of hunger and overeating, plus it’s associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Try to be mindful of the quality of your eating ritual by taking your time to truly savour each bite.
- Switch off from work: Many of us eat at our desks as we try to fit our daily meal rituals around our work schedules. What we may not realise is that eating while we’re distracted by work can make us more likely to overeat and less likely to make healthy eating choices.
- Be social: When you’re fully absorbed in your work, it can be easy to ignore your body’s hunger and satiety cues leading to overeating. Plus, research suggests that people who eat with others are less likely to be influenced by emotions such as stress.
- Be mindful: Eating is a very common activity but it’s also one that, by its very nature, is often done on autopilot. Practise mindfulness during your meal ritual by savouring each bite of your food, becoming fully aware of your body and the emotions that may be influencing you at the time.

## Develop Healthy Eating Habits

As well as creating healthy eating rituals, you can also start to develop healthy eating habits that can help to break the cycle of emotional eating. Try using the following tips to help you develop healthier eating habits that can help prevent emotional eating.

- Choose a healthy go-to snack: It’s important to have a healthy snack option on hand for times when you’re feeling hungry. However, it’s important to choose a healthy option that won’t cause you to overeat or sabotage your diet in other ways. Try a handful of nuts, a bowl of mixed seeds, an apple with peanut butter, a smoothie made with a protein shake, or a low-fat yoghurt with granola.
- Drink plenty of water: Although it’s commonly suggested that drinking water can help to reduce cravings, it can also help to reduce feelings of hunger and prevent overeating. Try to drink a healthy amount of water throughout the day to help you stay hydrated, feel fuller for longer and prevent emotional eating.
- Eat slowly: Eating more slowly can help you to savour your food, be more mindful and help prevent overeating. Try eating each meal more slowly, allowing yourself to fully chew your food and appreciate its flavour and texture.
- Eat more fibre: Eating more fibre can help to reduce feelings of hunger, improve digestive health and reduce feelings of anxiety. Try to eat more fibre-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.
- Avoid eating when you’re stressed: It may be a common recommendation but it’s also an important one. Eating when you’re stressed can cause digestive health issues, increase feelings of anxiety and make it more likely that you’ll turn to food again when you’re not truly hungry.

## Practise Self-Care Strategies

Another important part of overcoming emotional eating is learning how to practice self-care strategies that help you to better manage your emotions. Try to build self-care into your daily routine to help you to take better care of yourself and your mental health. This can include things like taking more frequent breaks from work, meditating, yoga, spending more time in nature, getting enough sleep, and spending more time with friends and loved ones.

Try to also focus on developing positive coping strategies to help you deal with negative emotions as they arise. This can include things like journaling, talking to a friend, or doing a creative activity to help you to release your emotions and better manage your mental health.

## Commit To Fitness Activities

Exercising is commonly recommended as a way to help treat a range of conditions from depression and anxiety to eating disorders. Not only can regular exercise help to improve your mental health, but it can also help you to lose weight and better manage your eating habits. When you regularly exercise, you’re likely to eat less as you’re more likely to feel full after smaller portions. Plus, exercise has been linked to improved emotional well-being and reduced feelings of anxiety and depression.

Try to commit to a regular fitness routine to help you improve your mental health and reduce your emotional eating. What type of exercise you do and how often you do it will depend on your fitness level. But the important thing is to commit to regular exercise to help boost your mental health and help you to overcome emotional eating.

## Take Care Of Your Mental Health

Alongside trying to reduce your emotional eating, it’s also important to take care of your mental health. When you’re regularly experiencing negative emotions, it can be easy to turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as emotional eating. However, it’s important to tackle the root cause of your negative emotions to truly overcome them. This can include things like practising mindfulness, reaching out to loved ones, and seeking professional help.

When you’re regularly experiencing negative emotions, it can help to keep a journal to track your moods and see if there are any patterns behind them. This can help you to identify what triggers your negative emotions and help you to better manage them. It can also help you to come up with coping strategies that are more effective than emotional eating.

## Conclusion

An emotional eater is someone who regularly overeats in response to stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions. You can start to break your emotional eating habits by creating healthy meal rituals, developing healthier eating habits, practising self-care, and committing to fitness activities. You can also take care of your mental health to prevent emotional eating. By following these tips, you can break your emotional eating habits and feel better about yourself.
