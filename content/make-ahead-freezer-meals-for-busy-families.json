What\\u2019s hot today could be yesterday\\u2019s news tomorrow. But whether you follow food trends or not, your customers will expect you to stay on top of what\\u2019s currently in vogue. So how should you deal with food trends? Do we follow them? Ignore them? Or just give them a lukewarm response?\nFollow food trends if it makes sense for your business, and use them as a way to stay ahead of competitors and gain new customers. Following trends gives your business an opportunity to attract new customers by keeping your place relevant with the latest tastes and preferences. At the same time, ignoring popular foods can also be risky as that can alienate potential patrons who are looking for those options when they come to dine at your establishment.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
