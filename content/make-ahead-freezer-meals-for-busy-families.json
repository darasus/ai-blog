Some foods help you lose weight faster and keep it off, while others have the opposite effect, either because they are high in sugar, fat or calories, or because they have very little nutritional value.\nSuch dietetic staples as broccoli and blueberries are great for losing weight. Other foods like chips and soda? Not so much. Keep reading to learn about the top 10 worst foods to eat if you\\u2019re trying to lose weight fast\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Sourdough doesn\\u2019t have any added sugars either; just natural sugars from the fermentation process.
