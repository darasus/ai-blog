One of the easiest is to invite a few friends over for a dinner party. Why? Because, at a dinner party, almost everything is off limits.

The first thing you should do is to make sure that your dog has plenty of space and something to chew on. Rawhides, for example, are great for dogs, and they\\u2019re safe enough to leave around your house. If your dog has his own toys, he\\u2019ll be less likely to go digging in your stuff.

Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings.
