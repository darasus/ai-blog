Fussing and fuming won\\u2019t make them any less likely to follow you anywhere, or to notice that bag of chips you just carelessly threw on the table. Dogs are dogs, which means they will follow your slightest lead and chip in with their two cents at every opportunity. Sadly, this also means that it\\u2019s not uncommon for dogs to get into things they shouldn\\u2019t. You like peace and quiet? Not so much when there\\u2019s a dog around. You like keeping your things? Good luck with that.\nBut luckily, with some bit of training and persistence, you can teach your pup exactly what\\u2019s off limits and exactly where to leave it instead.

Now, you don\\u2019t want your dog to get sick, but you also don\\u2019t want him to get into any trouble. There are several ways to make your dog more aware of what\\u2019s off limits. One of the easiest is to invite a few friends over for a dinner party. Why? Because, at a dinner party, almost everything is off limits. You want to keep your dog away from the food and drinks, of course, but you also want to keep him away from the tablecloth, the flowers on the table, and any other potential trouble.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rule 2: Use a \\u201CLeave It\\u201D Command\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another easy and effective way to train your dog is by introducing a \\u201CLeave it\\u201D command. How does it work? Well, every time your dog starts to get curious about something, you simply use this command. If your dog starts mouthing your couch, for example, you can use the command \\u201CLeave it.\\u201D If your dog starts digging in the dirt, you can use the same command. The \\u201CLeave it\\u201D command is simple enough that even young puppies can learn it and understand it! Once your dog knows the command and has started to get used to obeying it, you can also add a hand signal to make things even more clear.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rule 3: Use Rewards And Games To Train Your Dog\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Rewards and games are another excellent way to train your dog and get him used to being around your things without touching them. If your dog starts getting curious about something, try giving him a toy or a treat to get his mind off of it. If he starts to get too excited, clap your hands and tell him \\u201CNo.\\u201D You can even use the same toys to teach your dog that certain things are off limits. If, for example, your dog keeps getting excited about your old sneakers, put them in a toy. Your dog will have fun trying to get the shoes out, and he\\u2019ll learn that they\\u2019re not something he should be mouthing.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rule 4: Teach Your Dog About Touching Things\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Now, some things are just going to be off limits. For example, you don\\u2019t want your dog to eat your birthday cake, no matter how much he might want to. You don\\u2019t want him to get too close to the stove, either. But you don\\u2019t want him to be afraid of his own birthday present, so you have to find a way to teach him about touching things. The first thing you should do is to make sure that your dog has plenty of space and something to chew on. Rawhides, for example, are great for dogs, and they\\u2019re safe enough to leave around your house. If your dog has his own toys, he\\u2019ll be less likely to go digging in your stuff. You can also try spraying things like the stove and the kitchen table with a water bottle. That\\u2019ll let your dog know that it\\u2019s not okay to come too close.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rule 5: Be Patient & Stick With It\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Finally, remember that training your dog to leave things alone won\\u2019t happen overnight. Like humans, dogs also have to learn as they go, and they\\u2019re bound to make mistakes along the way. That\\u2019s not a bad thing, though. Mistakes are actually how dogs learn. If your dog makes a mistake, don\\u2019t get mad. Instead, let him know that he did something wrong and try again. Let\\u2019s say your dog is chewing on your couch, for example. Instead of getting mad, just get his attention and say \\u201COff.\\u201D And if he keeps chewing on the couch, try spraying it with water. If your dog doesn\\u2019t learn to leave things alone, you might find yourself hating house parties and having to keep your things out of sight at all times.
