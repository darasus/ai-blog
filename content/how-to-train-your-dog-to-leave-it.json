One of the easiest is to invite a few friends over for a dinner party. Why? Because, at a dinner party, almost everything is off limits.

The first thing you should do is to make sure that your dog has plenty of space and something to chew on. Rawhides, for example, are great for dogs, and they\\u2019re safe enough to leave around your house. If your dog has his own toys, he\\u2019ll be less likely to go digging in your stuff.

It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters.

Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature.
