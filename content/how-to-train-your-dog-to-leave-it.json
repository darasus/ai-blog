Now, you don\\u2019t want your dog to get sick, but you also don\\u2019t want him to get into any trouble. There are several ways to make your dog more aware of what\\u2019s off limits. One of the easiest is to invite a few friends over for a dinner party. Why? Because, at a dinner party, almost everything is off limits.

The first thing you should do is to make sure that your dog has plenty of space and something to chew on. Rawhides, for example, are great for dogs, and they\\u2019re safe enough to leave around your house. If your dog has his own toys, he\\u2019ll be less likely to go digging in your stuff.
