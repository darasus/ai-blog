  "title": "Go Language For Distributed Computing",
  "summary": "Go is a language used for general purpose programming and distributed computing. It was created at Google, and then open sourced to the public in 2009. Go is designed to be efficient in terms of memory use and speed. This makes it ideal for distributed computing because it relies on the collective processing power of many computers at once. Goâ€™s built-in libraries allow developers to build machine learning functionality into their apps, making the language ideal for use cases like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.",

Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
