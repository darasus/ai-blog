The road to success is never an easy one, and the same goes for learning new skills. If you have been thinking of learning Javascript but are not sure where to start, this post will guide you through the process and help you get there.\nThe programming language Javascript is most commonly used to add interactive features and dynamic content to website pages and internet applications. However, many people think it\\u2019s difficult to understand because of its weird syntax and strange naming conventions. But that doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t learn it!\nIt is a high-level programming language that can be used to create interactive websites, video games, computer programs, artificial intelligence systems, and more. It was invented by Netscape in 1995 so that their programmers could document their code better and make their website faster by eliminating the need for browser plugins like ActiveX or Java applets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In simple terms, we want to cut down the time between a code being written and it being ready for production.\nWe often see developers writing messy codes that are difficult to read or understand. The same goes for Ops engineers who find it challenging to debug different errors in production. This is where the Go language comes into play.\nSince its launch in 2009, Go has gained immense popularity among software developers across the globe, who have even dubbed it \\u201Cthe new old thing\\u201D. It was developed by Google as an alternative to other languages that were slow and memory-intensive at that time.\nIf you are a developer looking forward to implement DevOps with the help of Go, this article is for you!
