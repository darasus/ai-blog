That\\u2019s why the design of any new programming language involves a lot of user research. The creators of Python \\u2014 an open-source general-purpose programming language first released in 1991 \\u2014 recognized from the start that if they were going to succeed, they needed to create a language that was accessible and appealing to a wide audience.

However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding.
