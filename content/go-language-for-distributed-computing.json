In fact, it\\u2019s one of the most difficult tech fields to get started in as a beginner. But it\\u2019s also one of the most lucrative careers you can choose to pursue. The average software engineer salary is around $100K per year, which is even more impressive when you consider that the average age of software engineers is only 29! If you want to start a new career in coding but feel like you\\u2019re starting at square one, we have some advice for you. As someone who has been coding for over 10 years now, I can tell you with complete certainty that great coders are made and not born. Anyone can learn how to code if they are willing to work hard at it and adopt some good habits along the way.

It is a paradigm that allows you to think about your code in terms of input, output, and operations on those inputs and outputs. The advantages of using functional programming are higher code readability, ease of maintenance and testing, and shorter implementation time for complex algorithms.\nA variety of languages support functional programming features. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs as well as the other programming languages you already know. Depending on your preferences for syntax, size of community support, or availability of libraries for the type of projects you are working on now or might work on in future, different options might suit your needs better than others.\nIn this article we will explore some popular Go Language alternatives for Functional Programming with examples and pro/cons for each one:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
