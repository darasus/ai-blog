summary: TypeScript is a typed, static-typing language that compiles to
  JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript that allows developers to write
  code with more clarity and precision. This makes TypeScript useful for
  JavaScript developers who want to write better code that scales across
  platforms and browsers. To create a Hello World program in TypeScript, open a
  text editor and create a new file “HelloWorld.ts.” TypeScript can be
  downloaded and installed from the Visual Studio Code website.
intro: >-
  TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and
  maintained by Microsoft, that extends JavaScript. It adds support for typing
  variables and functions, interfaces, classes with inheritance, and modules.
  This article covers everything you need to know about TypeScript and why you
  should use it as a developer. 

  Let’s face it—the world of software development has become extremely complex in recent years. Each new programming language has its own unique set of rules and methods for creating code that ultimately ends up becoming a finished product that users can download from an app store or other website.

  In this article you will learn about the benefits of using TypeScript as a developer, how to install TypeScript on your computer, what IDE is best for using it with popular editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom Text Editor, how to get started coding in TypeScript by downloading boilerplate projects with sample code, and much more!

## Why Learn TypeScript?

The programming languages that most developers use were created decades ago at a time when the Internet was in its infancy and when mobile devices were just a dream. Technology has come a long way since then, but languages like JavaScript and Java have been slow to evolve.
This has led to a lot of issues and challenges in modern software development since the same code is often used on multiple platforms. TypeScript is designed to address these issues and help developers create more robust and scalable software.

When you write code in TypeScript, it is compiled into plain JavaScript. This process allows TypeScript to inherit all JavaScript’s features while adding its own. This makes TypeScript useful for JavaScript developers who want to write better code that scales across platforms and browsers.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language created by Microsoft in 2012. It is a typed, static-typing language that compiles to JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript that allows developers to write code with more clarity and precision and to create larger, more complex software systems. Because TypeScript is a compiled language, running it requires a tool to convert the code into normal JavaScript.

## Installing TypeScript

If you use a Mac or Linux computer, you can download and install TypeScript using the terminal or a command prompt. On Windows, you can download and install TypeScript from the Visual Studio Code website.

## Hello World in TypeScript

The classic “Hello World!” program is used by developers to test newly learned programming skills. To create a Hello World program in TypeScript, open a text editor and begin by creating a new file. Name this file “HelloWorld.ts.” Open this file and type the following code:

console.log("Hello, World!");

## Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language. This means that each programming variable or function must first be assigned a type. You can think of this type as a “label” that tells the program how to handle the data that is inputted into the program.

To better understand this concept, let’s take a look at a few examples of types in TypeScript. Let’s say that you wanted to create a program that adds two numbers together and then outputs the result. The program code might look something like this:

var answer = 12 + 9;

In this example, the variables “12” and “9” are numbers. The variable “answer” is a new variable that stores the results of adding “12” and “9” together.

## Summary

This article covered everything you need to know about TypeScript and why you should use it as a developer. You learned that TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft, that extends JavaScript. It adds support for typing variables and functions, interfaces, classes with inheritance, and modules. You also learned how to install TypeScript on your computer, create a Hello World program in TypeScript, and understand the types in TypeScript. Now that you’re armed with all the knowledge you need, go ahead and make the move to TypeScript!
