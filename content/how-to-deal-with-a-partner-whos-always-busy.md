It can be difficult to feel like you are always the one waiting around for your partner when they are always busy. You may feel like you are not a priority in their life and that can be tough to deal with. Here are some tips on how to deal with a partner who is always busy:

1. Talk to your partner about how you are feeling.

It is important to communicate with your partner about how their busyness is making you feel. Let them know that you feel like you are always waiting around for them and that you would like more time together.

2. Try to be understanding.

It is important to try to be understanding of your partner's busyness. They may have a lot going on at work or in their personal life and they may not be able to help it.

3. Make time for yourself.

If you feel like you are always waiting around for your partner, make sure to schedule some time for yourself. Do things that make you happy and make sure to spend time with your friends and family.

4. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

If you are feeling overwhelmed by your partner's busyness, don't be afraid to ask for help from them. Let them know that you need some assistance and see if they are able to help you out.

5. Talk about your expectations.

It is important to talk about your expectations with your partner. If you are expecting more time together than they are able to give, it may be necessary to adjust your expectations.

6. Seek counseling.

If you are having difficulty dealing with your partner's busyness, seek counseling from a professional. They can help you work through your feelings and find ways to cope with the situation.
