  Do you and your partner see each other often, or is it more like once a
  blue moon? If you live in different cities, or have demanding jobs that take
  up a lot of your time, it can be tough to make time for one another. However,
  if you’re in a long-distance relationship or simply see each other less
  frequently due to work or study commitments, this doesn’t mean there’s
  anything wrong with your relationship.

  Social life and personal relationships are important parts of our lives as adults. When we meet someone special, we want to invest time into making that relationship last. But what happens when you have a partner who is always busy?
   Understandably, being constantly busy isn’t easy to deal with on a regular basis. Trust us, we get it – being busy isn’t a bad thing! Everyone has moments when they are super-busy, but how do you deal with that in your relationship? Here are some tips.

## Set clear expectations

Whatever the nature of your relationship, it’s important to set clear expectations. You need to understand what your partner’s day-to-day responsibilities are and how they fit into their long-term plans. Your partner needs to understand what your life is like as well. Only then can you both begin to navigate the challenges of balancing two lives that are often very busy.

You want to know if you are a priority to your partner. Some people are very selfless and will always put others first, which can make it tricky to know where you stand. It can be helpful to sit down with your partner and have a conversation about the future. What do they see for themselves? Where do you see yourself in five years? What are your hopes and dreams for the future? Knowing where you both want to be in the near future can make it easier to navigate the present.

## Don’t take being constantly busy personally

Being constantly busy isn’t a reflection on the quality of your relationship. It doesn’t imply that your partner doesn’t enjoy spending time with you or that they don’t value your relationship as much as you do. It’s important not to take constant busyness personally. It isn’t a reflection on your relationship. It isn’t aimed at you. It’s simply a reflection of your partner’s life.

Try not to get upset or frustrated when your partner is constantly busy. Put yourself in their shoes and try to understand where the extra workload is coming from. Perhaps your partner is dealing with a challenging project at work. Or perhaps they have a lot of extra hours at the gym each week. If you can understand why your partner is constantly busy, it will be easier to accept the situation and move forward.

## Find ways to spend time together

Try to find ways to spend time together, even when your partner is constantly busy. For example, you could try scheduling regular dates. Rather than scheduling things at the same time, meet up on different days of the week. Even if your partner is extremely busy, they should still find time for you. Something as simple as a daily text or phone call can go a long way in showing that you are important. Be creative and think of ways you can spend time together. It doesn’t have to be something big and fancy. There are lots of things you can do that don’t require a lot of time or money.

If your partner is busy at work, there may be days when they need to stay later than usual. You don’t need to keep your partner company on every late night. Instead, you could offer to bring them dinner on the nights they are working late. Not only will this help keep your partner from getting takeout every night, but it will also show them that you are thinking about them.

## Don’t see constant busyness as a sign of things to come

People change all the time. If you’ve been with your partner for a while now, you know their habits and patterns. You know how they operate in different situations and what they are like at different times of the year. If you’ve been with them long enough, you’ll know that they are busy at times and that they are less busy at other times. This isn’t a bad thing. It’s just how life is sometimes.

If you’ve been with your partner for a while now, don’t jump to conclusions just because they are currently busy. Instead, make plans to spend time together when things have calmed down. If you notice that your partner is constantly busy and always seems to be busy, but they have time for other people, this may be a sign that they don’t value your relationship as much as you do. In this case, it might be better to move on and find a partner who is busier when you need them to be.

## Commit to the relationship regardless

Sometimes the best way to deal with being perpetually busy is to commit to the relationship regardless. It can be easy to let things fall by the wayside when your partner is constantly busy. You may start to resent them or feel as though you aren’t important. Whatever you do, don’t give in to these feelings. Instead, try to do things that will help you stay positive and focused on your relationship.

Stay in touch with your partner when they are busy. Don’t let the busyness get in the way of your communication. If they are at a point where they need to be busy, try not to take it personally. Instead, talk to them about the things you would like to do when they have more free time and make plans for how you can spend time together. When you are in a relationship, you have to be flexible and willing to adapt to whatever circumstances come your way.

## Bottom line

Being constantly busy isn’t easy. In fact, it can be incredibly stressful. When you have a lot of responsibilities and not enough time to deal with them, it can be tough to keep your head above water. It may seem like there’s no room for a relationship in all of this, but it’s important not to give up.

If you have a partner who is always busy, there are ways to make things work. Rather than feeling frustrated or resentful, use these tips to make the most of your relationship.
