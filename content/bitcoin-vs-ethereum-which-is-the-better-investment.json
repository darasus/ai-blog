While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators.

However, that reputation isn\\u2019t necessarily fair. The real risk lies in how companies implement blockchain instead of the technology itself.\nThere are potential risks when adopting new technologies such as blockchain; however, implementing it correctly can help your business thrive by streamlining processes and reducing costs.
