The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself.

With a market capitalization of over $115 billion, Bitcoin has come a long way. But it is not without its problems. The prevalence of centralized exchanges and custodial services, as well as recent price manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users of the virtual currency.\nMoreover, with institutions, governments and individuals increasingly recognizing the value of digital tokens, crypto-anarchists are becoming concerned that Bitcoin may not be sufficiently anonymous to protect against intrusion from authorities or intermediaries (e.g., exchanges and data brokers). This has led to an increase in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies\\u2014 known as \\u2018privacy coins\\u2019\\u2014 like ZCash, Dash and Monero.\nThankfully, there is also a solution within this problem: Bitcoin Private (BTCP).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
