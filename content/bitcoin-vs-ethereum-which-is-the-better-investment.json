Both of these virtual currencies were created using blockchain technology. And they each have a finite supply that is expected to be released over time. Bitcoin's price has been around since 2009, and its price has risen steadily since 2011. Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, which means that the token can be exchanged for a wide range of assets.",
