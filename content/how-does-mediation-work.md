summary: Mediation involves a discussion of the issues in dispute, assists with
  brainstorming possible solutions, and helps the parties reach a settlement.
  Mediation does not impose a solution on the parties; the parties must agree to
  the terms of any settlement. The parties' attorneys can be present, but they
  don't participate in the mediation itself. The mediation process begins with
  an assessment by the mediator to determine the strengths and weaknesses of
  each party’s position. The mediator uses various mediation tools and
  techniques to facilitate communication between the parties. Mediation is
  collaborative, flexible, and can be modified to accommodate the parties’
  schedules.
intro: >-
  Mediation is a process that brings together two people, or parties, who
  are in conflict with one another to resolve their dispute. It’s an alternative
  to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again.
  Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works
  for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs
  and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering
  their needs and goals as well. 

  Mediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.

  An added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation…

## What Happens in Mediation?

In mediation, the parties' attorneys can be present, but they don't participate in the mediation itself. The mediator facilitates a discussion of the issues in dispute, assists with brainstorming possible solutions, and helps the parties reach a settlement. The mediator does not impose a solution on the parties. The parties must agree to the terms of any settlement.
When mediation begins, the parties exchange information about the dispute, including past efforts to resolve it. Then the mediator asks each party to describe his or her view of the situation and what he or she wants. The mediator attempts to help the parties empathize with each other and work toward a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute.

## How Mediation Works

The mediation process begins with an assessment by the mediator to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s position. Then, the mediator and each party develop a strategy based on their respective strengths and weaknesses. They work together to find solutions to the issues in dispute that will work for both sides.
The mediator uses various mediation tools and techniques to facilitate communication between the parties. As communication increases, so does the likelihood that the parties will reach a solution to their dispute. In addition to assisting communication between the parties, the mediator may also assist the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.

## Mediation Steps

The mediation process involves the following steps:

- Screening and contracting: The mediator will first determine if the disputing parties are appropriate for mediation and if the dispute is appropriate for mediation. If mediation is appropriate, then the mediator will help the parties draft a mediation contract that includes the agreed upon mediation process, mediation costs, and the mediator’s role, responsibilities, and limitations.
- Gathering information: To assist the parties in drafting their mediation contract, the mediator will ask them questions to determine their goals, needs, and interests. The mediator will also ask the disputing parties to provide documentation to support their position and help them to draft their mediation contract.
- Negotiation and brainstorming: The mediator will help the parties brainstorm possible solutions to their dispute. He or she will also assist them in negotiating a mutually acceptable solution to their dispute.
- Reporting to the parties: As the mediation process proceeds, the mediator will report to the disputing parties on the progress of the mediation.

## Questions to Ask Before Starting Mediation

- Is mediation the best option for resolving the dispute?
- Is mediation best for both parties?
- What factors contributed to the dispute?
- What are the parties’ goals, needs, and interests?
- What are the parties’ strengths, weaknesses, and gaps?
- What are the parties’ communication strengths and weaknesses?
- What solutions are possible?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each solution?
- What are the possible consequences of not resolving the dispute?
- How long will it take to resolve the dispute using mediation?
- How much will it cost to resolve the dispute using mediation?

## The Benefits of Mediation

- Mediation is cost-effective. Compared to litigation, mediation is often less expensive. The cost of mediation includes the mediator’s hourly rate, attorney’s fees, and any other costs associated with the mediation.
- Mediation is flexible. The mediation process can be adjusted to fit the needs of the parties. The mediation process can be modified to accommodate the parties’ schedules and any special needs they may have.
- Mediation is private. The parties control the disclosure of information about the dispute, the mediation process, and any settlement reached.
- Mediation is collaborative. The mediation process encourages the parties to work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
- Mediation is controlled. The parties control the outcome of the mediation process.
- Mediation is empowered. The parties are empowered to make their own decisions and to take responsibility for their actions and decisions.

## Limitations of Mediation

- Mediation is not appropriate when the parties cannot communicate effectively with each other. When this is the case, the mediation process will fail.
- Mediation may not produce an enforceable agreement. If one or both parties decide not to follow through with the terms of the mediated agreement, there is no legal way to enforce the agreement. However, if the parties do sign an enforceable mediation agreement and one or both parties do not follow through with it, one or both parties could be held in contempt of court.
- Mediation does not involve a hearing or a ruling by a judge. If the parties disagree about the terms of the mediated agreement, it may not be possible to appeal the terms of the mediated agreement.
