Both of these programming languages are popular in the software development industry. However, they have some subtle yet important differences that set them apart from one another.\nBut first, before we dive into the details of each programming language, let\\u2019s understand what they both have in common.\nBoth JavaScript and TypeScript are dynamic, object-oriented programming languages designed for creating websites and other interactive applications. They both support curly bracket syntax with optional semicolons, as well > operators for type checking, and if-else conditional statements.

This article covers an overview of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as its pros and cons.\nIf you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.\nObject-oriented programming is different from imperative languages in important ways. Object-oriented programming is a way of writing programs that aims to reduce redundancy and increase modularity by using objects that have their own data fields and methods that act on those fields instead of global variables.
