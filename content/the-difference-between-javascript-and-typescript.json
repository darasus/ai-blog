TypeScript is an open-source tool created by Microsoft that adds strong typing and object-oriented programming capabilities to JavaScript. It brings many of the programming benefits of languages like C++, Java, and C# to the world of JavaScript development. With TypeScript, software developers can write more reliable code, and improve the overall experience for their end users. The TypeScript programming language is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to unmodified JavaScript.",

Do you know which of these programming languages is right for your project? If so, read on to learn more!\nIn this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over everything you need to know about TypeScript vs. JavaScript. Both of these programming languages are popular in the software development industry. However, they have some subtle yet important differences that set them apart from one another.\nBut first, before we dive into the details of each programming language, let\\u2019s understand what they both have in common.\nBoth JavaScript and TypeScript are dynamic, object-oriented programming languages designed for creating websites and other interactive applications. They both support curly bracket syntax with optional semicolons, as well > operators for type checking, and if-else conditional statements. Both support variables, data types (string, boolean, number), and function calls with optional arguments and return values.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
