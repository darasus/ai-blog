For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

They create, maintain and update the software that powers businesses, websites and apps. And demand for software engineers continues to grow. Job postings for software engineers have increased by 37 percent in the last five years, with an additional 26 percent increase expected by 2024.\nSoftware engineering is also one of the most competitive fields to break into at the moment. There is a shortage of skilled candidates, which has led to high demand and high salaries for top software engineers who can drive innovation in their companies. To become a software engineer and land one of those coveted jobs, you will need to complete a computer science degree or take up coding classes.

There are so many programming languages available in the market that it might seem confusing for programmers to select the one that best suits their needs and also caters to future needs.\nProgramming is not as simple as it seems, especially when you consider all the different aspects involved with it. It is not just about learning code, but also understanding which types of projects you want to take up and what kind of structure your career will take from here on. So when choosing a programming language, there are certain aspects you need to keep in mind before making your final decision. To help you out with this, we have outlined some of the main pros and cons associated with using Go for embedded programming in this article:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
