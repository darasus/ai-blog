## The art of filming in the wild

One of the most impressive feats of this film is that it was filmed in the wilderness of Alberta, Canada – it is truly a feat to be able to film such a massive movie in the midst of nowhere. It’s estimated that the film crew spent over 400 days shooting “The Revenant” in difficult conditions. The wilds of Alberta are not temperate, and snowfall is a very real and very dangerous thing to deal with in the middle of filming. This meant that the cast and crew would have to pack up and relocate to a different location every few days as the snowfall would make shooting in the original location impossible.

This wasn’t the only difficulty the crew had to deal with either. Bears are a very real danger in Alberta, and the crew had to use trained bear dogs to protect their food from the bears. This was especially important as the cast and crew lived in the wilds of Alberta for the duration of filming, meaning no hotels for them, just tents in the snowy wilderness.

## More than just a movie about revenge

Now don’t get us wrong, “The Revenant” is a movie that is mostly about revenge. But it’s also a movie that delves into the very nature of what it means to be human. “The Revenant” takes its time introducing its characters, allowing the audience to get to know them before they are put into an impossible situation where they have no choice but to fight for their lives. By the end of the film you are able to understand the motivations behind each character, even the ones who seem to be pure evil. It is through this that we get a glimpse into the true nature of humanity – we come to understand that everyone is fighting for something, even the seemingly “evil” characters. We also come to understand that some of these battles are more difficult than others; that some fights are impossible to win.

Hugh Glass himself is a man who loses everything along his journey. He loses his son, his child, his wife, his health, his dignity, and more along the way. He is pushed to the brink of death, and yet he still fights for survival. He is a man who has no choice but to fight against his very humanity in order to survive.

## The best performance of Leonardo DiCaprio’s career

There’s no doubt that DiCaprio is one of the greatest actors of our generation, but in “The Revenant” he has taken his acting to a whole new level. DiCaprio spent months living and breathing the role of Hugh Glass. He was so committed to the role that his co-stars started calling him “Dr. Living-in-the-Wild”. He even ate raw bison liver and slept in animal carcasses to get into character.

This dedication to his art is what makes DiCaprio’s performance in “The Revenant” so phenomenal. He is able to take an otherwise one-dimensional character and make him feel like a real person. You can feel his pain, you can feel his suffering, thanks to the dedication that DiCaprio has put into the role.

## Things to look out for while watching “The Revenant”

There are so many things to look out for while watching “The Revenant”. For one, pay attention to the bear scene. DiCaprio and the crew actually filmed this scene with a real bear, so be sure to keep an eye on the bear while watching. Another thing to look out for is the themes of the film. There are many themes to discover within the film, including the idea that we are all equals; no one is better than another. We also see that true beauty comes from the struggle of surviving in a brutal world, and that revenge is not the answer to our problems.

Finally, look out for the symbolism within the film. Many of the props and costumes within the film have been designed to hold a deeper meaning. For example, the bear’s claw necklace that DiCaprio wears throughout the film is supposed to represent nature’s taking of one life in order to give another.

## Final Words: An experience you will not soon forget

If all this hasn’t convinced you, then nothing will. “The Revenant” is a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll. It’s a brutal and violent film, but it is also a beautiful and inspiring tale. It is a film that shows us that while we may not always win the battle, we must always continue pushing forward. It is a film that shows us that even the strongest among us have weaknesses. It is a film that will leave you breathless with its beautiful cinematography, its brutal and visceral combat, and its deep and meaningful story.
