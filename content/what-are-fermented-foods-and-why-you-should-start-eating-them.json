Perhaps the most well-known fermented foods are cultured dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir. Fermented vegetables, such as kimchi and sauerkraut, are also extremely common. Fermented food is a natural process that\\u2019s been happening since the beginning of time. It\\u2019s how people preserved food before fridges and freezers were invented. If you\\u2019ve ever left a piece of bread on a windowsill, it\\u2019s likely that you\\u2019ve also witnessed the fermentation process at work. When left in a warm, moist environment, bread naturally ferments, with the help of bacteria.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Fermented food has been eaten for thousands of years, and it\\u2019s a staple in many cultures. Traditional fermented foods include miso, tempeh, natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, kefir, apple cider vinegar, and pickles. Note that not all traditional fermented foods are created equally; they may differ in their nutrient content and processing. The fermentation process has been linked to positive health outcomes thanks to the production of organic acids. And fermentation isn\\u2019t just a great way to preserve food \\u2013 it also increases the amount of nutrients in the food, making it more nutritious and easier for your body to absorb.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why are fermented foods so good for us?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Fermented foods are incredibly good for us because they\\u2019re rich in probiotics. Probiotics are friendly bacteria that live in our digestive systems and help to keep us healthy by promoting a healthy gut environment. As fermented foods are rich in probiotics, they can improve your digestive health, boost your immune system and help to regulate your blood sugar levels. If you\\u2019re struggling with any of these conditions, eating more fermented food may help to ease your symptoms. Many people also believe that fermented foods can help with weight loss, as they can reduce your appetite and help you to feel fuller for longer. Fermented foods are also rich in vitamin B, which can help to boost your mood. As fermented foods are also rich in vitamin C, they can boost your immunity and protect you from illnesses like the common cold and flu. Fermented vegetables also contain calcium, which can help to strengthen your bones and prevent osteoporosis. Fermented foods also contain minerals, such as iron, magnesium and selenium, as well as beneficial amounts of dietary fibre. There\\u2019s also evidence that fermented foods could help to prevent cancer, as they have been shown to kill off cancer cells in vitro studies. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to start eating more fermented foods\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re keen to start eating more fermented foods, there are plenty of options that are easy to incorporate into your diet. You can start by making sure that you\\u2019re consuming probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt, kefir and kombucha. Fermented vegetables are also a great choice, and they\\u2019re especially easy to incorporate into your diet if you\\u2019re a vegan or vegetarian. You can add fermented vegetables to salads, sandwiches or soups, or you can use them as toppings on pizza. You can also make your own fermented vegetables at home, which is much cheaper than buying them from supermarkets and comes with the added benefit of being able to control what goes into them. You can also try fermenting your own vegetables and fruits. If you\\u2019re new to the world of fermented foods, it might take a little while to get used to the taste. Fermented foods have a very distinct flavor, so it\\u2019s worth bearing in mind that you might not like them the first time that you try them.
