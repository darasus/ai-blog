Fermented food is a natural process that\\u2019s been happening since the beginning of time. It\\u2019s how people preserved food before fridges and freezers were invented. If you\\u2019ve ever left a piece of bread on a windowsill, it\\u2019s likely that you\\u2019ve also witnessed the fermentation process at work.

Traditional fermented foods include miso, tempeh, natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, kefir, apple cider vinegar, and pickles.

The fermentation process has been linked to positive health outcomes thanks to the production of organic acids.

If you\\u2019re struggling with any of these conditions, eating more fermented food may help to ease your symptoms. Many people also believe that fermented foods can help with weight loss, as they can reduce your appetite and help you to feel fuller for longer. Fermented foods are also rich in vitamin B, which can help to boost your mood. As fermented foods are also rich in vitamin C, they can boost your immunity and protect you from illnesses like the common cold and flu. Fermented vegetables also contain calcium, which can help to strengthen your bones and prevent osteoporosis. Fermented foods also contain minerals, such as iron, magnesium and selenium, as well as beneficial amounts of dietary fibre.

Fermented vegetables are also a great choice, and they\\u2019re especially easy to incorporate into your diet if you\\u2019re a vegan or vegetarian. You can add fermented vegetables to salads, sandwiches or soups, or you can use them as toppings on pizza. You can also make your own fermented vegetables at home, which is much cheaper than buying them from supermarkets and comes with the added benefit of being able to control what goes into them. You can also try fermenting your own vegetables and fruits. If you\\u2019re new to the world of fermented foods, it might take a little while to get used to the taste.
