intro: EOS and TRON have both recently gained a lot of attention from the
  cryptocurrency community. While both projects have done so for different
  reasons, it’s no secret that both EOS and TRON have been attempting to compete
  with Ethereum as potential alternatives for developers looking to build
  decentralized applications (dApps). Both EOS and TRON are often referred to as
  “the Chinese Ethereum” due to the similarities in their functionality as well
  as their focus on becoming the primary blockchain for dApps. However, there
  are clear differences between these two projects that set them apart from one
  another. Let’s take a closer look at NEO and its competition with EOS and
  TRON.

## What is NEO?

NEO is a smart contract platform that allows developers to create dApps similar to Ethereum. The NEO token is used to pay fees on the network, and GAS is used as a sort of fees for those making transactions on the network. NEO was developed by the Chinese startup called “OnChain”, and it’s often referred to as “the Chinese Ethereum” since it can be used to build the same types of dApps. While NEO and Ethereum are both open-source blockchain platforms that are primarily used to create dApps, they both have some clear differences.

NEO’s main function is as a smart contracts platform that enables decentralized processes like crowdfunding, voting, etc. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a wider range of uses including decentralized apps, token creation, and even managing other cryptocurrencies.

## How NEO Works

Similar to Ethereum, NEO enables developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on top of their blockchain. However, there are a few key differences between the two platforms. NEO is significantly faster than Ethereum, clocking in at about 10,000 transactions per second (tps) versus Ethereum’s 15 tps.

NEO also has a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum, as well as a different fee structure. While Ethereum charges per transaction, NEO charges per amount of computing that is used to “run” the distributed apps. NEO also uses a different mechanism for increasing the network’s capacity to handle more transactions.

## EOS vs. NEO

While EOS and NEO are both smart contract platforms that allow developers to build decentralized applications, they have a few key differences. For example, NEO has a more robust decentralized application ecosystem than EOS, with over 1,000 applications currently being built on their blockchain. EOS, on the other hand, only has 50 applications currently on their platform.

In terms of speed, security, and scalability, EOS is significantly better than NEO. EOS is able to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world. Unlike NEO, EOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, which is viewed as more efficient than NEO’s delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) consensus mechanism.

## EOS Pros and Cons

EOS is one of the fastest and most powerful blockchain networks in the world. It’s also packed with features that make it one of the most attractive blockchain networks for developers. However, EOS is also one of the most centralized blockchains in the world. The system is controlled by its 21 nodes, which are “elected” by token holders who hold at least 10 EOS.

This situation has caused a lot of controversy, and it’s a big reason why NEO has recently been gaining popularity. As a “decentralized” platform, users are less concerned about centralized authorities controlling their data.

## TRON vs. NEO

TRON, which is another “decentralized” network, is aiming to compete with NEO as the Chinese Ethereum. While TRON doesn’t have the same dApp ecosystem as NEO, it’s more focused on becoming the largest decentralized media platform in the world. TRON’s goal is to provide users with unlimited content and a free internet.

In terms of technology, TRON also has some key advantages over NEO. For example, TRON’s network can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, which is about six times faster than NEO. TRON is also much cheaper than NEO, with TRON’s GAS token costing only fractions of a penny per token.

## TRON Pros and Cons

While TRON has a lot of potential in the long-term, it’s unclear if the network can ever catch up to NEO. While NEO has been around for over three years, TRON is still in development. NEO also has a bigger team of developers and is backed by the Chinese government, which could give it an edge in the long run.

However, one advantage that TRON has over NEO is that it’s compatible with the Ethereum network, which could help TRON with adoption. With ETH’s scalability issues, TRON could potentially become more popular as users look for an alternative blockchain to launch their decentralized apps.

## Final thoughts

Overall, EOS and NEO are two of the leading smart contract platforms. Both platforms have a lot of potential, and it will be interesting to see which one ends up becoming more popular in the long run. While EOS and NEO are often referred to as “the Chinese Ethereum”, there are clear differences between these three projects. NEO is a smart contracts platform that’s been around for three years. EOS is a newer blockchain network that’s packed with features. And TRON is aiming to become the largest decentralized media platform in the world.
