NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency which was founded in 2014 by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. NEO uses a unique consensus mechanism called dBFT (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance), and is capable of 10,000 transactions per second. NEO is often referred to as the Chinese Ethereum, as it has many similarities to Ethereum, such as supporting smart contracts. However, there are also some key differences between the two platforms. For example, NEO uses a different programming language (C#) compared to Ethereum (Solidity). NEO also has a different economic model, with a focus on "digital assets + digital identity".
