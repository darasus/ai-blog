Building a JavaServer Faces application is a simple process. First, you need to create a new project in your IDE. Once the project is created, you need to add the required libraries. These libraries can be found in the JSF Core and JSF API download pages. After the libraries are added, you need to create a faces-config.xml file. This file is used to configure the application. The next step is to create the managed beans. These beans are used to store the data that will be displayed in the application. Finally, you need to create the pages that make up the application. These pages are created using JSF tags.
