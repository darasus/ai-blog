Today\\u2019s mobile users expect their devices to be more than just communication tools; they want them to be an extension of their digital lifestyle.

There are also a large number of third-party libraries available, making it an appealing option for many businesses. The language has a long history and has been used for creating a variety of applications, though it is particularly well suited to developing apps for computer networks.

Kotlin was first released in 2011 and was developed by programmers who were tired of the verbosity and complexity of Java.
