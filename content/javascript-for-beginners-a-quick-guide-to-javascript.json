It feels like one confusing labyrinth with a lot of locked doors \\u2013 every time you find an unlocked door, it just leads to another locked door! How do we get out of this frustrating loop? Coding shortcuts!\nA lot of coders will tell you that in order to be a successful coder, you need to know everything about coding and all its ins and outs. However, there is a reason why even experienced programmers take note of coding shortcuts. These little tricks make life easier for anyone who is just getting started with coding and doesn\\u2019t have time to invest in learning every last bit of it before they can start creating useful programs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them. In this blog post, you will learn about various types of exceptions in Java and how we can handle them using try-catch blocks effectively.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
