If so, you\\u2019re in luck. In recent years, there has been an explosion of new software development frameworks that have made coding much easier for developers. These frameworks are known as \\u201Cno-code\\u201D or \\u201Clow-code\\u201D software solutions because they require significantly less code to implement than older programming methods. One such framework is Spring, which is currently one of the most widely used lightweight enterprise solution platforms available today. Even though it was first released almost 15 years ago, Spring continues to expand its functionality with each new version release. In this blog post, we will cover introduction to Spring and help you understand what it can do for you as a developer.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After all, why spend 15 minutes learning something when you can just copy and paste it instead?
