## Why is Self-Learning Important for Personal Growth?

When you learn by yourself, you become independent. You don’t have to depend on a particular school or institution to learn the subjects you want to study, and you don’t have to follow a pre-determined timetable. You can choose what you want to learn and how often you want to learn it.
You’re also more likely to retain the information you learn through self-learning as you’re motivated to learn on your own terms and aren’t following a strict schedule.
Self-learning also allows you to better understand what interests you. If you follow a typical path of studying a subject at school, you’re likely to focus on what you’re being taught and what your teachers want you to learn, whereas through self-learning, you can choose to focus on whatever interests you.

## How to Start Self-Learning

There are many different ways you can go about self-learning. To get started, you can:

- Read and write - Reading books and writing in a journal are the best ways to improve your literacy and grammar skills. You can also write down your thoughts and reflections in a journal.

- Listen to audio books - You can listen to audio books in any genre and on any subject that interests you.

- Watch educational videos - You can find endless educational videos on a wide variety of subjects on YouTube. You can also watch podcasts, Ted Talks and online courses.

- Join online communities - Online communities are an excellent way to make connections with people who share similar interests and ideals, as well as a great place to get advice from people who’ve been in your shoes before.

## Build a habit of reading and writing.

Reading books and writing in a journal are the best ways to improve your literacy and grammar skills. You can also read books by authors who come from different cultures and backgrounds so you can better understand how other people think and feel. Reading books from different cultures also helps you become more culturally aware and knowledgeable about a wide variety of subjects. Reading books also provides an excellent source of inspiration and motivation for you. If you want to read more, try developing the habit of reading for 15 minutes a day. It won’t seem like a burden when it’s part of your daily routine. Reading also helps you learn to empathize with others, think critically and better understand yourself. It’s a great way to learn new things, make new friends and improve both your vocabulary and grammar. Reading expands your knowledge and helps you become a more well-rounded person. Reading can be done anywhere, and it’s a great way to relax and unwind after a long day at work or school.

## Go on a digital decluttering mission.

If you’re anything like most people in this day and age, you may feel like your digital life is taking over your real life. With so many apps and websites to use, you may feel like you’re always busy and never have time for yourself. Doing a digital decluttering mission is an excellent way to clean up your digital life and give yourself more time to focus on what matters most to you. It’s important to remember that you don’t need to be constantly connected to the internet and your devices. It’s essential to take time for yourself and disconnect from the world so you can relax and unwind after a stressful day.

## Find the right learning platform for you.

There are many different learning platforms that offer a wide variety of subjects, such as Coursera, edX and Khan Academy. You can search for online courses on any subject that interests you or that you feel needs improvement. You can also find online communities where you can interact with people who have similar interests to you.

There are also apps designed to help you learn. As time goes by, technology has advanced, and these apps have become more and more helpful. With these apps, you can learn a new language, improve your skills or take on a new challenge.

These apps can be downloaded on your phone, so you can take them wherever you go. They are interactive and can be very helpful in your learning journey.

Self-learning is an excellent way of getting to know yourself better and identifying your strengths and weaknesses. It gives you the opportunity to discover your passions and interests, which in turn helps you figure out what career path is best for you or what tertiary education would be beneficial for you.
