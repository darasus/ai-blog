Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The mediator acts as a neutral party who helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable manner.\nIn mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It\\u2019s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It\\u2019s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response.
