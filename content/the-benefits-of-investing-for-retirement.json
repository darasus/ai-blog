As you get older, you may have to reduce the riskiness of your retirement investments to prepare for the future. Knowing your risk tolerance is important when investing during retirement. It’s important to know your own risk tolerance because if you don’t know your investment portfolio, you should increase the percentage of your portfolio even more by increasing the risk of your investments.",
