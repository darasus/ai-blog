It\\u2019s not the most exciting part of software development, but it\\u2019s an important one. The file system is the cornerstone of almost every program you use on your computer. Working with files in Java can seem a little counterintuitive at first. Once you understand what makes it different from other programming languages, it becomes much clearer.\nWorking with files in Java involves creating, reading, updating and deleting files. Files are stored as strings or bytes. If you have used other programming languages before, this will be familiar to you. In Java, there are two separate ways of working with files: standard streams and the new \"File\" class introduced in version 1.1 of the language. This article explains how to work with files using both methods and also touches on some related topics such New>.../New> tags and Jar archives (self-executable packages).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
