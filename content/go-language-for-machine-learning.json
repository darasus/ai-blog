Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is a paradigm that allows you to think about your code in terms of input, output, and operations on those inputs and outputs. The advantages of using functional programming are higher code readability, ease of maintenance and testing, and shorter implementation time for complex algorithms.\nA variety of languages support functional programming features. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs as well as the other programming languages you already know. Depending on your preferences for syntax, size of community support, or availability of libraries for the type of projects you are working on now or might work on in future, different options might suit your needs better than others.\nIn this article we will explore some popular Go Language alternatives for Functional Programming with examples and pro/cons for each one:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Parallel computing refers to the simultaneous execution of computer programs or tasks so that they operate at the same time rather than sequentially. This ability to execute multiple processes simultaneously leads to faster and more efficient results. Applications like artificial intelligence, image recognition, and natural language processing are all fields that can benefit greatly from parallel computing techniques. Because of this demand for parallel computing techniques, there are many programming languages available specifically for this purpose. The Go language is one such example.
