No matter what your specialty is or what type of software you want to build as a career, knowing more than one programming language will help you see things from different perspectives, recognize patterns, and solve problems more efficiently.\nIn this blog post, we\\u2019ll take a look at 7 JavaScript basics that every TypeScript developer should know.

If your thoughts immediately went to the idea of parent and child classes, then you\\u2019ve either studied object-oriented programming or you understand the nuances of English. However, if you think about a parent giving birth to a child, then you obviously haven\\u2019t studied enough OOP. Let\\u2019s see what inheritance in Java is all about and why it\\u2019s useful.\nWe often find ourselves reusing code that has been implemented in some other class. This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another. This is called inheritance in Java. It is one of the cornerstones of OOP programming and something that every serious programmer should know well.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

You might already know some other languages or have experience with concurrency so you probably are wondering how does the Go programming language help with concurrent programming.\nIf you are just getting started with Go, it might feel like a steep learning curve if you\\u2019ve never used its features before. However, as soon as you learn about channels and see how easy it is to implement them, things start making much more sense. Concurrent programming is an extremely complex topic that requires careful planning to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Fortunately, Go offers a set of standard library packages for concurrent tasks so that developers can focus on writing code instead of reinventing the wheel every time they create a new project. Let\\u2019s take a closer look at why we need concurrent programs and what Go has to offer in this regard.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
