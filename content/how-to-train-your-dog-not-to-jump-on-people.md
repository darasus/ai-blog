Dogs jumping on people is a common problem that many dog owners face. There are a few things you can do to train your dog not to jump on people.

One way to train your dog not to jump on people is to ignore them when they jump up. Do not pet them or give them any attention when they jump up. This will teach them that jumping up does not get them what they want.

Another way to train your dog not to jump on people is to say "no" or "off" in a firm voice when they jump up. You can also push them away from you with your hand. Be consistent with this and eventually they will learn that jumping up is not allowed.

You can also try to redirect their jumping behavior by giving them something else to do. For example, if they jump up on you when you come in the door, have them sit or lie down instead. Give them a treat if they do this so they know they are doing what you want.

Jumping up on people can be a nuisance, but with some patience and consistency, you can train your dog not to do it.
