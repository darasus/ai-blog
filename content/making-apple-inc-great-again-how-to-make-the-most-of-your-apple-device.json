In the new digital economy, businesses must focus on how technology can transform their current services and operations to meet the needs of their customers. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots are transforming the way we work \\u2014 especially in manufacturing and logistics operations. Automation and robotics have made it possible for manufacturers to produce more goods with fewer workers, while increasing production efficiency and accuracy at the same time. These technologies are also reducing labor costs, increasing output, and easing recruitment challenges that many manufacturers face in developing countries where youth unemployment remains high.
