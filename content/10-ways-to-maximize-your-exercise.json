For example, you can try doing your pushups on an incline or doing squats with a weighted bar. Or you can go outside and try different activities, like hiking, rock climbing, or playing sports like tennis or basketball. Even things like walking or biking can help you burn calories and reduce your stress levels and improve your mood. Remember that you don\\u2019t have to do everything at once.

One way to do this is to use a fitness tracker, such as a wearable device, to track how many calories you burn and how many steps you take each day. You can also take measurements of your body for comparison as you progress. For example, if you want to increase your strength, you can measure your pushup and squat progress over time to see how much you\\u2019ve improved.
