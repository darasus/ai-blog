## Plan ahead and be consistent

The first step to blogging success is planning. It is important to decide what you want to achieve with your blog and how you want to structure your content.
While some people start a blog because they want to make money, others want to establish their authority in their field of expertise. Whether you are in it for the money or want to build your personal brand, you need to figure out who your target audience is and what they want to read.
Once you have a clear goal and a general idea of the topics you want to cover, you can make a schedule. If you are serious about blogging and want to make the most of it, then you need to make blogging a consistent habit.

## Write and post consistently

Consistency is key for building an audience and authority.
As a beginner blogger, it is important to start with small but consistent content.
After you have planned your content, start writing. Make sure that you write something that is engaging and resonates with your audience.
You should aim to post at least 2-3 times a week. If you are consistent with your posts, your audience will grow, and you can expand your reach.

## Network with other bloggers

If you want to become a successful blogger and build a large readership, you will have to network with other bloggers. You can exchange guest posts, collaborate on posts, and even collaborate on podcasts. By networking with other bloggers, you will find that your audience grows as well as your word value.
In addition to networking with other bloggers, you should make sure to comment on other people’s posts. You can use these comments as a way to introduce yourself and build a relationship with your audience.

## Start a newsletter

Another great way to build your online presence is to create an email list.
Many people are shifting their focus to email newsletters, because they are less spammy than social media platforms.
In order to build a successful email list, you need to offer something valuable in return for your subscribers. You can give away free weekly recipes, helpful tips and tricks in the kitchen, or even discounts on your products.
Your email list is a way for you to build a relationship with your audience.

## Think about paid advertising

While you should definitely focus on organic traffic to your site and content, you might benefit from paid advertising. If you are just starting out, you might have a hard time getting your content seen.
When you start with paid advertising, you will be able to get your content in front of a wider audience and drive more people to your site.
