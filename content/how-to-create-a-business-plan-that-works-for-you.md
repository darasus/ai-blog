## What is a business plan and why does it matter?

A business plan is a written document that outlines your small business plan and strategy. It will include information about your company, the industry you are in, and market research about your customers. You should also include financial projections for the next 3-5 years. A well-written business plan will save you time and energy, because once you have written it you have everything you need to know about your business in one place. A business plan will also help you collect investor interest, secure financing, and give you a roadmap for success. In short, a business plan is a roadmap that will help you successfully navigate your business. It shows your investors, employees and partners that you have a clear understanding of your business and what it takes to be successful.

## What should be included in your small business plan?

Include the cost of all your expenses such as equipment, marketing, staff, inventory and payments on any loans you might take out. Investors will also want to see this forecast to make sure you have enough money to get started. Be careful about inflating your figures to make the numbers look better. Investors will see right through that. You can also use this cash flow forecast to show investors how much money you will need on a monthly basis to keep your company running smoothly.
