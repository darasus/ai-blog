## What is a business plan and why does it matter?

A business plan is a written document that outlines your small business plan and strategy. It will include information about your company, the industry you are in, and market research about your customers. You should also include financial projections for the next 3-5 years. A well-written business plan will save you time and energy, because once you have written it you have everything you need to know about your business in one place. A business plan will also help you collect investor interest, secure financing, and give you a roadmap for success. In short, a business plan is a roadmap that will help you successfully navigate your business. It shows your investors, employees and partners that you have a clear understanding of your business and what it takes to be successful.
