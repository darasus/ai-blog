This can be tricky since big data is often unstructured and changes frequently. Many programming languages were designed for smaller data sets and are not efficient for analyzing big data. Go was designed to efficiently handle large data sets and work with unstructured data. Go is compiled and statically typed, which means the compiler can catch errors earlier in the development process. This and its efficient use of resources makes the language well suited for the challenges of big data.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Although Go has been used in the data science space for some time, it has recently seen an increase in adoption by data engineers.

Larger data sets often require distributed systems built around a concept called parallel programming. Parallel programming is the concurrent execution of code across multiple processors. This is necessary to collect, process, and store large data sets efficiently. Parallel programming is usually achieved through specialized languages designed for distributed systems. These languages can be challenging to learn and implement in production. Go was designed for distributed systems from the start. This makes it an easy choice for companies looking for a language for big data.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Go makes it easier to handle unstructured data, which is common in big data sets.
