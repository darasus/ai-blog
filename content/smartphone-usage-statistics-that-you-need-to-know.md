## 30% of smartphone users only use their device to talk and text.

A staggering number of smartphone owners only use their device to make and receive phone calls and send and receive texts. Around 30% of users only use their phone for those functions, while another 60% use it for those activities and browsing the Internet.
A large percentage of users don’t need to do more because they already have everything they need in one device.

## 80% of people browse the internet using their smartphones.

Smartphones have clearly evolved from being used primarily for phone and texting to being primarily used as a tool for browsing the Internet. And the trend continues, with data suggesting that approximately 80% of people use their smartphones for this purpose.
And as smartphones continue to evolve, the percentage of people using them for browsing will likely continue to increase.

## 51% of Americans own a smartphone and almost everyone has access to one.

More than half of all Americans now own a smartphone, and the majority of them use it for Internet browsing. There has been an increase in ownership of almost 10% from 2016 to 2017, with 51% of the population now owning a smartphone.
A similar proportion of people have access to a smartphone (meaning they can borrow one if they don’t own one). The only group where smartphone adoption has not increased is among people aged 65 and above.

## Google is the most common app that people use on their smartphones.

The most common app that people use on their smartphones is Google. This will come as no surprise to many marketers as Google is used by people for everything from researching products to finding directions.

People also use their smartphones to check social media, play games, and make calls. Surprisingly, only a small percentage of people use their smartphones to access email.

## 74% of consumers use their smartphones while shopping in-store.

As smartphones become the primary tool for many activities, marketers are leveraging the device to improve the customer experience.
Beyond using your phone to look up product reviews and prices, you can also use it to shop for items in-store. Knowing which products are in stock, you can reserve them for pickup using a shopping app.
There are also many apps that enable you to scan items as you shop, which can be added to a shopping list or be purchased directly from your phone.

## 85% of 18-29 year-olds respond to mobile advertisements.

Mobile advertising is another effective way to reach your target audience.
When it comes to the effectiveness of these advertisements, there is a significant difference between desktop and mobile.
The majority of 18-29 year-olds respond to mobile advertisements in-store and when on the go.
And while the number of people responding to mobile ads on desktop computers is also increasing steadily, it is nowhere near as high.

## 45% of all Internet traffic comes from smartphones.

The amount of traffic that smartphones generate has increased significantly in the past few years, rising from 30% in 2015 to 45% in 2018. This growth is driven in part by the increase in the number of people using their smartphones for browsing.
This increase means that businesses need to have a mobile-friendly website (which can be achieved by using a responsive or adaptive design) if they want their target audience to find them online.

## 21% of adults answer calls on their smartphones while they’re doing something else.

Having a smartphone has allowed people to make calls from anywhere at any time. But it has also led to an increase in the number of people using their devices for other activities while talking on the phone.

The most common of these is web browsing, followed by watching videos and games. Surprisingly, a small percentage of people also read books while making calls.

## 14% of children own a smartphone and 8 out of 10 children have access to a smart device at home.

Children aged between 8 and 12 years old are one of the fastest growing groups of smartphone owners. A significant number of them now own smartphones and many have access to a smart device at home.
This access can impact the attention span of young people. The average attention span of American children has dropped from 12 seconds in 1999 to just 8 seconds in 2013. And this has been linked to the rise in the use of smartphones in the classroom.

## Conclusion

Smartphones have changed the way people spend time, communicate and consume information. Businesses have taken note of this and are actively trying to reach their target audience through mobile devices. As a result, smartphone penetration has increased significantly in recent years, with the number of users now reaching almost 70% of the population.
