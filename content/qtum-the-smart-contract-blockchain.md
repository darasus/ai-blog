Qtum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). Qtum is built on the Bitcoin blockchain and utilizes the UTXO model. Qtum also features a Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP), which allows Qtum token holders to vote on changes to the blockchain.

Qtum is a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Qtum utilizes the Bitcoin blockchain and UTXO model, while also incorporating Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM). This allows Qtum to run smart contracts and dapps.

Qtum’s DGP allows for on-chain governance of the Qtum blockchain. Qtum token holders can vote on changes to the blockchain, such as changing the block size or adjusting the gas limit.

Qtum is a versatile blockchain platform that can be used to create smart contracts and dapps. Qtum’s DGP allows for on-chain governance, making it a more decentralized platform than Ethereum.
