However, cats actually produce certain proteins in their saliva that actually worsen allergies in humans. However, there are certain breeds that have been bred to have low levels of these proteins in their saliva and are therefore less likely to trigger allergies in their owners.\nFor example, the Sphynx is an all-hairless breed that doesn\\u2019t produce any allergies at all.

However, in modern times, cats are often considered to be more of a luxury item than a necessity.\nThis has led to many people living alone or with limited social interaction, which can have a negative effect on their health.

The result is a faster, more cost-effective resolution than going to court or some other formal proceeding.\nMediation for businesses has many benefits. Chief among them are reduced stress, greater trust, increased collaboration, and improved performance. Negotiating can be stressful and lead to strained relationships if one party feels like the other isn\\u2019t being fair or trustworthy.\nMediation helps resolve these issues in a constructive way by establishing a safe space where people can fully understand each other\\u2019s perspectives. Trust increases when people feel like they won\\u2019t be attacked or criticized for their ideas. Collaboration improves as everyone works together towards a common goal instead of against each other. And performance increases because people are more comfortable bringing up any problems so they can be fixed sooner rather than later - leading to better company growth and development.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
