It\\u2019t also less expensive than going to court and doesn\\u2019t give your opponent any negative information that could be used against you in the future. The only potential drawback to mediation is that it requires both parties to agree on an outcome they are happy with. If one party feels like they have no other options, they may not be willing to mediate. However, this should not stop you from exploring this option further.\nMediation has many benefits over other methods of dispute resolution, such as negotiation and arbitration. However, every type of settlement has its drawbacks. Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of mediation as a dispute resolution technique:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
