  "title": "The Top 10 Benefits Of Owning A Cat",
  "summary": "Cat owners are less likely to suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and the risk of developing a mental illness such as schizophrenia is lower for people who live with cats. Cats produce certain proteins called cytokines, which have been shown to help regulate the human immune system. The act of petting a cat can lead to a significant decrease in blood pressure, pulse rate, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Cats are very good at reading human body language and they intuitively know when you are stressed or anxious.",
  "intro": "When it comes to the topic of cats, a lot of people tend to have preconceived ideas about what owning one entails. There is a general belief that having a cat as a pet will cut down on your social life and limit your ability to travel. While that may be true for some people, that generalization doesn’t tell the whole story. Cats are fantastic pets, and if you choose the right breed, they can bring many benefits to your life. Cat ownership offers numerous positive benefits in many different areas of your life. These are just some of the reasons why you should own a cat!",
  "content": "## Increased Mental Health\n\nStudies have shown that the act of petting a cat can be very therapeutic and might even help to treat anxiety and mild depression. The benefits don’t stop there, either; owning a cat can also help to improve your mental health in several other ways. Cat owners are less likely to suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and the risk of developing a mental illness such as schizophrenia is lower for people who live with cats. That’s because cats produce certain kinds of proteins called cytokines, which have been shown to help regulate the human immune system.\n\n## Stress Relief\n\nCats are very good at reading human body language, and they intuitively know when you are stressed or anxious. Many cats will respond to these emotions by curling up in your lap, wrapping their paws around your arms, and emitting a low-frequency sound called a “purr.” This purr has actually been proven to be more than just a cute sound; it is a powerful tool for reducing stress and improving your overall health.\n\nSome studies have shown that the act of petting a cat can lead to a significant decrease in blood pressure, pulse rate, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Other research has shown that people who own a cat are less likely to suffer from hypertension and heart disease.\n\n## Better Breathing\n\nMany pet owners believe that a cat will help to keep their allergies under control by removing dust mites and other allergens from the environment. However, cats actually produce certain proteins in their saliva that actually worsen allergies in humans. However, there are certain breeds that have been bred to have low levels of these proteins in their saliva and are therefore less likely to trigger allergies in their owners.\nFor example, the Sphynx is an all-hairless breed that doesn’t produce any allergies at all. Other breeds such as the Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, and the Siberian are bred to reduce allergy-provoking proteins in their saliva, making them a good choice for allergy sufferers.\n\n## Enhanced Vocabulary\n\nOwning a cat has been shown to improve vocabulary skills in children, especially those who have a reading disorder. That’s because the act of talking to, and trying to communicate with, a cat is very similar to that of reading. Both activities require you to decode symbols and put them into a language you understand.\nAfter being exposed to a cat, many children are found to gain a better understanding of language in general. This is because they are required to engage with something that isn’t written word, and the process helps them to understand it better. As a result, children with reading disorders often have their skills greatly improved when they are taught to read to their cat.\n\n## Companionship\n\nCats are very affectionate animals, and they rely heavily on the people in their lives for support. Many cat owners will tell you that their cats become very attached to them, and they often become important members of the household.\nWhile dogs have been bred to serve a specific purpose (i.e., to help their owners hunt), cats have simply been bred to be companions. However, in modern times, cats are often considered to be more of a luxury item than a necessity.\nThis has led to many people living alone or with limited social interaction, which can have a negative effect on their health. Owning a cat can help to counter this; it can provide you with a sense of companionship and improve your mental health.\n\n## Exercising With Your Cat\n\nCats are very active animals, and they are known to get a lot of their exercise by playing. However, unlike dogs, cats don’t always have a desire to interact with their owners and can often be very independent.\nTo get the most out of owning a cat, you must be willing to engage with your pet. Playing with your cat on a regular basis can be a very good form of exercise, especially if your cat is willing to play fetch or run around with a toy. Some cats will even return the toy to you after they’ve caught it, making them ideal for people who enjoy playing sports like tennis.\n\n## Helping You Live Longer\n\nCats have often been viewed as a source of bad health in many cultures and have been blacklisted as pets for many people because of their inability to fight disease. However, new scientific discoveries are showing that this might not be the case.\n\nCats can actually help to improve human health by fighting off a certain type of parasite called the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). This parasite has been found to be a major cause of death around the world, with certain studies showing that it may be responsible for up to one million deaths annually.\n\nHowever, owning a cat can help you to protect yourself from this parasite. That’s because cats are the only animal that is able to produce an enzyme that can kill off T. gondii completely. This is because the parasite has to be able to infect any warm-blooded creature in order to survive. Cats are the only warm-blooded creatures with an enzyme that can kill T. gondii before it can infect you.\n\n## Window Watching\n\nCats are very curious animals, and many of them have an inherent desire to explore. This can be problematic when you own a cat and want to keep them in your house. There are a few things you can do to keep your cat happy while keeping them safe.\n\nThe first thing you can do is to get a window perch that allows your cat to sit near a window without being able to escape. This will give your cat a place to sit and bat at the birds that are flying past, keeping them occupied on a daily basis.\n\nAnother thing you can do is to get a large screen for your window. This can be fitted so that it covers the entire window, allowing you to see out but keeping your cat from being able to escape.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOwning a cat comes with many benefits, both mental and physical. If you want to experience these positive effects, you should consider getting a cat as a pet. Some people might be hesitant to own a cat because they believe they are too old to care for one. This is a misconception since kittens are very easy to care for and require very little attention. \n\nCats have been proven to be extremely beneficial to the health of their owners, making them a great choice for people of all ages!"
