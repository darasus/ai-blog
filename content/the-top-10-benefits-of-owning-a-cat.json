The benefits don\\u2019t stop there, either; owning a cat can also help to improve your mental health in several other ways. Cat owners are less likely to suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and the risk of developing a mental illness such as schizophrenia is lower for people who live with cats.

Many cats will respond to these emotions by curling up in your lap, wrapping their paws around your arms, and emitting a low-frequency sound called a \\u201Cpurr.\\u201D This purr has actually been proven to be more than just a cute sound; it is a powerful tool for reducing stress and improving your overall health.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some studies have shown that the act of petting a cat can lead to a significant decrease in blood pressure, pulse rate, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Other research has shown that people who own a cat are less likely to suffer from hypertension and heart disease.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Better Breathing\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Many pet owners believe that a cat will help to keep their allergies under control by removing dust mites and other allergens from the environment. However, cats actually produce certain proteins in their saliva that actually worsen allergies in humans. However, there are certain breeds that have been bred to have low levels of these proteins in their saliva and are therefore less likely to trigger allergies in their owners.\nFor example, the Sphynx is an all-hairless breed that doesn\\u2019t produce any allergies at all. Other breeds such as the Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, and the Siberian are bred to reduce allergy-provoking proteins in their saliva, making them a good choice for allergy sufferers.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Enhanced Vocabulary\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Owning a cat has been shown to improve vocabulary skills in children, especially those who have a reading disorder. That\\u2019s because the act of talking to, and trying to communicate with, a cat is very similar to that of reading. Both activities require you to decode symbols and put them into a language you understand.\nAfter being exposed to a cat, many children are found to gain a better understanding of language in general. This is because they are required to engage with something that isn\\u2019t written word, and the process helps them to understand it better. As a result, children with reading disorders often have their skills greatly improved when they are taught to read to their cat.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Companionship\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Cats are very affectionate animals, and they rely heavily on the people in their lives for support. Many cat owners will tell you that their cats become very attached to them, and they often become important members of the household.\nWhile dogs have been bred to serve a specific purpose (i.e., to help their owners hunt), cats have simply been bred to be companions. However, in modern times, cats are often considered to be more of a luxury item than a necessity.\nThis has led to many people living alone or with limited social interaction, which can have a negative effect on their health. Owning a cat can help to counter this; it can provide you with a sense of companionship and improve your mental health.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Exercising With Your Cat\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Cats are very active animals, and they are known to get a lot of their exercise by playing. However, unlike dogs, cats don\\u2019t always have a desire to interact with their owners and can often be very independent.\nTo get the most out of owning a cat, you must be willing to engage with your pet. Playing with your cat on a regular basis can be a very good form of exercise, especially if your cat is willing to play fetch or run around with a toy. Some cats will even return the toy to you after they\\u2019ve caught it, making them ideal for people who enjoy playing sports like tennis.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Helping You Live Longer\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats have often been viewed as a source of bad health in many cultures and have been blacklisted as pets for many people because of their inability to fight disease.

That\\u2019s because cats are the only animal that is able to produce an enzyme that can kill off T. gondii completely.

If you want to experience these positive effects, you should consider getting a cat as a pet. Some people might be hesitant to own a cat because they believe they are too old to care for one.
