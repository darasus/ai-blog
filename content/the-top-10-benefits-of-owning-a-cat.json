Fussing and fuming won\\u2019t make them any less likely to follow you anywhere, or to notice that bag of chips you just carelessly threw on the table. Dogs are dogs, which means they will follow your slightest lead and chip in with their two cents at every opportunity. Sadly, this also means that it\\u2019s not uncommon for dogs to get into things they shouldn\\u2019t. You like peace and quiet? Not so much when there\\u2019s a dog around. You like keeping your things? Good luck with that.\nBut luckily, with some bit of training and persistence, you can teach your pup exactly what\\u2019s off limits and exactly where to leave it instead.
