Mediation is a process in which a mediator facilitates communication between parties to help them resolve a dispute. Mediation is an informal and confidential process in which the mediator does not make decisions or impose solutions on the parties. The mediator helps the parties to identify their interests, clarify their issues, and explore possible solutions. The parties are then able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
