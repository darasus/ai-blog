For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

You might have noticed this while reading the article about Controls \\u2013 there were a few controls which didn\\u2019t have their own article but were mentioned nonetheless as being part of the javafx-ui-controls module. This means that not all controls are provided by the core JavaFX library (although most of them are).\nIf you plan on using JavaFX for your application, then you should know that several modules exist within the scope of this library: ENDENDENDENDENDENDENDENDEND`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
