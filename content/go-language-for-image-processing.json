The language’s built-in concurrency model lets developers write programs with many running processes. Go compiles to native code that can run on multiple platforms without needing to be rewritten. Go is also a good language for webcam streaming and image manipulation. Go code compiles directly to machine code (native code) for each specific hardware platform.

It\\u2019s simple, fast, and predictable with no unnecessary syntax and a lightweight syntax that leads to programs that are easy to read and understand.\nGo has several built-in features that let it stand out from other general programming languages. For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
