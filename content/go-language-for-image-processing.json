That\\u2019s exactly what has happened with Python though, which is why in this article you will learn all you need to know about this programming language and why it\\u2019s the best choice for your next project.\nThere are plenty of programming languages available right now, each with their own unique pros and cons. However, not all of them manage to capture hearts and minds like Python has. This dynamic general-purpose programming language has become one of the most commonly used since its release in 1991 and remains so today. In fact, as we look ahead at trends in AI, data science and machine learning, there\\u2019s every indication that Python will continue to grow in popularity for years to come.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Everything from your camera to the apps you use to chat with friends requires software code that\\u2019s specifically designed for the operating system and its particular hardware architecture. These operating systems are often called \\u201Csystem programming languages\\u201D because they have a singular focus on the underlying system rather than end user applications.\nIf you look at any list of popular programming languages, you\\u2019ll see that Go is pretty uncommon - especially as a primary language used by system programmers and developers. However, there\\u2019s also been a lot of talk recently about how Go has become an excellent choice for projects that require intensive performance and tight memory usage.
