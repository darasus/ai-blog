Beyond these benefits, self-learning can help boost your earning potential by providing you with a skill set that will set you apart from others in the job market. Learning how to code, for example, is a skill that many employers are actively looking for, but few people have. As a self-learner, you have the opportunity to expand your skill set to include these types of highly desirable skills.
