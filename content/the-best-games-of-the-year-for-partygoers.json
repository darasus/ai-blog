The game is divided into seven rounds, where each player is dealt seven cards, and each round represents one of the great wonders of the world being built. You are given eight different resources, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and each round has you deciding how to use them. Your opponents might be given the same cards as you, but you don\\u2019t know what they will do with them until the cards are played. That makes 7 Wonders both strategic and unpredictable.
