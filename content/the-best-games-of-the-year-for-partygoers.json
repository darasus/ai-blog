With that being said, the video game market has seen a huge increase in popularity of games with an adult aesthetic.\nThe best rated adult games have left behind the cartoonish characters and storylines of old, instead focusing on darker storylines and character development to keep players coming back for more.\nThat being said, there are plenty of great games out there that don\\u2019t shy away from their adult nature.
