The data is not housed in a single database, it is replicated and stored in many nodes at the same time.

This is because the data stored in the database is validated by the consensus mechanism, each node validates the data by solving a complex mathematical puzzle.

On the other hand, Bitcoin serves as a digital currency that can be sent through the internet directly from one user to another with no third party or intermediary.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!
