There are different programming languages and frameworks that you need to know to do your job well. With the growing popularity of mobile apps and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), developers now have multiple opportunities in the field of software development. In this blog post, we will introduce you to Java as one of the most popular programming languages for developers. You will also learn about how to set up your Java development environment so that you can get started coding as soon as possible.\nIf you want to become a software engineer, knowing how to code is just the tip of the iceberg. You also need to understand technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and XML which are standard vocabulary for website design and computer data storage.
