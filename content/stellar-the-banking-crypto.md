summary: Stellar is a blockchain protocol that facilitates cross-border
  payments. The network is decentralized, meaning it is not owned or managed by
  any single authority. The protocol is designed to facilitate low-cost and
  quick transfers between two parties. Stellar can process about 1,000
  transactions per second, making it one of the fastest decentralized exchanges
  in existence. It also supports the creation of “asset-backed” tokens that
  represent real-world assets like gold coins, company stock, or real estate. In
  2015, Stellar was used to facilitate a $100 million payout from WalMart.
intro: >-
  With the first quarter of 2018 coming to a close, now is a good time to
  take stock of which coins are primed for growth in the coming year. In this
  post, we’ll take a look at Stellar, an under-the-radar crypto that could break
  out in Q2 and beyond. 

  We know it’s still early days for crypto, but we think there’s also genius insight locked away in these digital tokens. So much of what makes a coin great doesn’t come from its technology or usage as much as its real-world potential. 

  When evaluating a cryptocurrency for long-term investment, we ask ourselves: How does this token solve a real problem? Does it have the potential to be adopted by many users? Is there an opportunity for this coin to appreciate in value? If you can answer yes to all of these questions, you may be interested in investing in Stellar — here’s why:

## What is Stellar?

Stellar is a blockchain protocol that facilitates cross-border payments. The Stellar network is decentralized, meaning it is not owned or managed by any single authority. Instead, Stellar’s network is made up of thousands of independent servers that run the Stellar software.
Stellar was originally founded by the founder of Airbnb and the co-founder of Lyft. The idea behind the protocol was to provide a decentralized global exchange that would allow users to send money across borders quickly and at a low cost.
Stellar is primarily used for cross-border transactions. The protocol is designed to facilitate low-cost and quick transfers between two parties. Stellar can process about 1,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest decentralized exchanges in existence.
Stellar also supports the creation of “asset-backed” tokens. These are tokens that represent real-world assets like gold coins, company stock, or real estate. When one of these tokens is created, a corresponding real-world asset is deposited in an escrow account.

## Why Stellar?

Stellar is a crypto that is optimized for cross-border transactions. It is built to connect banks, payment systems, and individuals to facilitate low-cost payment settlements. Stellar’s core functionality is its advanced consensus mechanism that allows it to process hundreds of transactions per second. This makes it well-suited for high-volume applications like global money transfers.
Stellar’s consensus mechanism also allows it to process “fraud proofs” that can detect and halt payment attempts if the funds are being sent to a fraudulent party. As a result, it may be possible to use Stellar for checking account-like transactions in the future. This could make it a compelling option for developing countries that need low-cost financial services.
Stellar’s advanced consensus mechanism makes it uniquely suited for decentralized applications that require high throughput. There are thousands of developers building on top of the Stellar network.

## A Brief History of Stellar

Stellar was originally known as “OpenCoin”, which was the name of the company that created the Stellar network. The company was founded in 2014 by the founder of Airbnb and the co-founder of Ripple. They created the network as a fork of Ripple.
Stellar was initially built to facilitate international money transfers between financial institutions. In 2015, Stellar was used to facilitate a $100 million payout from the giant retailer, WalMart.
Stellar’s first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was held in 2015, when the company sought to distribute $100 million worth of Stellar tokens to fund development.
Stellar had a breakthrough in 2017 when it partnered with the blockchain company, Blockchain, to facilitate cross-border payments on Blockchain’s network. This partnership allowed Stellar to increase its global reach and gain exposure to more investors.

## A Solid Foundation for the Future

Stellar’s core functionality is facilitating low-cost and quick cross-border payments. Stellar’s technology is well-suited for facilitating cross-border payments because it is decentralized. This means that there is no single authority governing the network. Instead, the network is made up of thousands of independent servers that run the Stellar software. This decentralized model makes it difficult for a single party to shut down the network.
Stellar’s decentralized model also makes it easy for financial institutions to use the network. Many banks and payment systems use a distributed network to process transactions. For example, one bank might send funds to another bank through a third “clearing” bank. The clearing bank collects all the funds from the originating bank, aggregates them with funds from other banks, and then wires them to the destination bank.
Stellar can be used in clearing banks to aggregate funds from several banks and send them to the destination bank. This makes it easy for banks to send and collect funds through Stellar’s network.

## Where to buy and store XLM

Stellar can be bought and sold on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
Stellar can be stored on the official mobile wallet or on the desktop wallet.
Stellar can be stored in a paper wallet.
Stellar can be stored in the Trust Wallet.

## Final thoughts
