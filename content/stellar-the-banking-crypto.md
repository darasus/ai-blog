Stellar is a digital currency that was created in 2014. It is similar to Bitcoin in that it is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. However, Stellar has some key differences that make it unique. For one, Stellar is not just a digital currency. It is also a payment system. This means that you can use Stellar to send and receive payments. Additionally, Stellar has its own decentralized exchange. This allows users to trade Stellar without having to go through a central authority. Finally, Stellar is designed to be inflation-proof. This means that the supply of Stellar will never increase, which makes it a good long-term investment.
