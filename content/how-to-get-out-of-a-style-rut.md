If you're in a style rut, it can feel like you'll never be fashionable again. But don't worry, there are ways to get out of it! Here are some tips:

1. Take a look at your wardrobe. What do you tend to wear most often? What are your go-to pieces? Once you identify your staples, you can start to mix things up a bit.

2. Experiment with new styles and trends. Just because you're not a fashionista doesn't mean you can't try new trends. If you're unsure about something, start small. For example, if you're thinking about trying a new hair style, start with a new color or cut.

3. Get inspiration from others. Take a look at what your friends or celebrities are wearing. You don't have to copy their style exactly, but it can give you some ideas.

4. Shop around. Don't just stick to the same old stores. Check out some new ones, or even shop online. You might be surprised at what you find.

5. Be confident. The most important thing is to wear what makes you feel good. If you're confident in your outfit, you'll look great no matter what you're wearing.
