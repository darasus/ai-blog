1. Start with a base of greens. A mix of lettuces or even spinach or kale is a great way to start your salad.

2. Add in some chopped vegetables. tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and onions are all great choices.

3. Choose a healthy protein. grilled chicken, salmon, or tofu are all great options.

4. Add a flavorful dressing. balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and lemon juice are all great choices.

5. Top it off with some fresh fruit or nuts for a little extra flavor and crunch.
