intro: >-
  Putting together a healthy salad is usually the first thing people think
  of when they want to eat well and lose weight. Unfortunately, many people also
  associate salads with bad food because they’ve had so many disappointing
  experiences eating them in the past. That’s because most salads we see today
  are either served in large fast-food containers or come with an enormous
  amount of dressing that you need a spoon to get out of the little plastic
  tub. 

  However, there’s no reason why salads have to be boring, sad excuses for food. In fact, a good salad can be one of the healthiest and most satisfying ways to eat greens – as long as you know how make it taste great without making it worse for you.

## By now you’re probably thinking, “Great! But how?”

When you combine lots of different ingredients in a bowl, the tastes are bound to mingle and balance each other out. This is why it’s so important to vary the contents of your salads. When you keep eating the same salad over and over again, you get bored of it and start to dislike it even though it’s healthy.
When you’re making a salad with a dressing, the first thing you should do is add the dressing to the bottom of the bowl and then pile on the rest of the salad ingredients. This way, the leaves stay dry and crisp until the very end, giving you a fresh and satisfying crunch when you’re done.

## The bad news: Salads don’t taste good unless you add a lot of bad stuff.

Some people think eating healthy means eating tasteless foods that are nothing more than a pile of raw vegetables. But eating healthy doesn’t mean you have to give up all the nice things in life, like yummy food and tasty drinks. The only thing you need to give up, however, is bad stuff that would make otherwise healthy foods less healthy.
For example, most salads taste pretty bland without some kind of oil or fat. Unfortunately, most types of oil are bad for your health. They usually contain the type of fat that can lead to heart disease and other serious health problems.

## The good news: You can make salads taste great without adding a lot of bad stuff!

First of all, you don’t have to eat tasteless salads if you know what to add. However, we do recommend that you reduce the amount of fat you add in order to make your salads healthier and tastier. Instead of relying on bad oils to make your salads taste better, you can use one of these five alternatives to make your salads taste great without adding bad stuff:

- Fresh herbs: Other than tastiness, herbs also have healing properties and are rich in nutrients. Basil, for example, is high in Vitamin K which is essential in blood clotting, and Vitamin A which is essential for growth and development in the body.

- Protein-rich legumes: Beans are a great source of protein and fibre, which are important in maintaining a healthy and balanced diet. They can also help in weight reduction as they contain low-calorie protein and high water content, which makes you feel fuller for a longer period of time.

- Low-fat dairy products: Yogurt and low-fat cheeses are incredibly tasty and creamy additions to a salad. If you want to make your salad healthier, choose low-fat options which have fewer calories and less fat than full-fat varieties.

- Crunchy vegetables: Even though vegetables are good for you, most are fairly tasteless on their own. That’s why it’s important to add other foods to salads such as nuts, seeds and grains. They add texture and flavour to your salad without adding too many calories or fats.

- Crisp and colourful fruits: Even though fruits are healthy and nutritious, most are high in sugar and calories. Therefore, it’s important to add fruits in small amounts to your salad and make sure they’re fresh and crisp.

## Don’t forget the protein.

Apart from vegetables, salad is also a great source of protein. Thanks to the protein in salad, it’s a complete meal. 
You can add proteins like legumes, beans, nuts, seeds, quinoa, tofu, poultry, fish, and eggs to your salads. They are good sources of protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals.
While protein-rich additions like nuts and seeds are rich in fats, it is important to consume them in limited quantities. Protein rich foods like beans and lentils are a better option for salads as they are low in fats.

## Add lots of veggies with different flavours and textures.

Vegetables are healthy, nutritious and tasty. If you add a variety of vegetables (with different flavours and textures) to your salad, it will taste better and more interesting.

- Crunchy vegetables: Crispy vegetables like carrots, cucumbers and cabbage are great additions to salads as they add crunch and texture to salads. They also add vitamins and minerals to salads.

- Vegetables that are rich in antioxidants: Veggies like tomatoes, peppers, avocados, and spinach are rich in antioxidants, which are good for your health. They are also excellent additions to salads.

- Vegetables with different flavours: Adding vegetables with different flavours is important as the flavour of the salad will vary with every bite.

- Vegetables with different textures: Vegetables with different textures are also important for salads. When you add crunchy, crispy and soft vegetables to your salad, it will be tastier and more enjoyable. You can also pick vegetables that are a combination of two or three textures.

## Bottom line

Salads are a great way to eat healthy and lose weight. They are healthy, nutritious and they taste good too! If you want to make your salads taste great, you need to make sure that they are well-balanced and don’t contain too many fats. To do this, add protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals in your salads. You can also add low-fat and fibre-rich veggies to your salads to make them healthier and more delicious.
