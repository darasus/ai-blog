It is easy to get caught up in the moment and panic when it drops, or get overly excited when it rises. But if you take a step back and look at investing from a long-term perspective, things are not as scary. In fact, index funds are a great way to invest your money for the long run.\nIt is natural to have some fear or apprehension about putting your hard-earned money at risk by investing in the stock market. After all, many people witnessed the bursting of the dotcom bubble first hand and saw their retirement accounts plummet as a result. However, that does not mean you should avoid investing in stocks altogether\\u2014not even with recent recession still fresh on everyone\\u2019s mind.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These are known as \"loads\" because they reduce your return. A no-load fund has no upfront or hidden costs. These mutual funds have a small initial investment requirement, which may be as little as $50.\nThese funds have other characteristics that make them different from those with load fees: No-load mutual funds generally don\\u2019t charge commissions or sales fees. They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public.
