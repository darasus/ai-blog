## Keep a Javascript Cheatsheet By Your Side

A lot of people find that having a cheatsheet by their side gives them a sense of confidence and reassurance that helps them stay focused and on track. 
If you’re just starting out with Javascript, having a cheatsheet by your side is a great idea because it acts as a guide or a map to guide you through the different concepts and terminologies used in the language. 
Keeping a Javascript cheatsheet by your side is also a great way to remind you of the core concepts and structures of the language. This is important because Javascript has many similarities with other programming languages. 
So having a Javascript cheatsheet is a great way to refresh your memory, especially when you’re just getting started.

## Memorize These 11 core Javascript concepts

In order to master any skill, it is important to first learn the core concepts and principles.
For programmers, this means mastering the basics and essential elements of the programming language they are learning.
This is particularly important when it comes to Javascript because it is one of the most complex and widely used programming languages in the world.
For this reason, it is essential to learn and memorize the 11 core concepts of Javascript to help you get a better grasp of the language. 
The following 11 concepts are essential to understanding the language properly. These concepts will help you master Javascript in 5 minutes.

- Syntax -
Syntax refers to the rules or patterns in which language is written.
- Data Types -
All programming languages have built-in data types. These data types are the types of information that can be written or stored in a computer.
- Variables -
A variable is an identifier for a piece of data.
- Conditional Statements -
Conditional statements are used for executing certain parts of code only if a certain condition is met.
- Loops -
A loop is a piece of code that can be executed again and again.
- Functions -
Functions are like small programs that are used to organize and group pieces of code into one place.
- Objects -
An object is a collection of data and associated functions.
- Arrays -
Arrays are used to store a collection of data items in a single variable.
- Regular Expressions -
Regular expressions are a special type of syntax used for pattern matching.
- Built-in Objects -
Built-in objects are pre-programmed objects that help programmers to complete their task easier.

## Don’t Forget To Learn Backend Programming Language

Although Javascript is a great language to get started with, you should learn about other programming languages as well. 
Learning about other programming languages will help you get a better understanding of how they work together. This will come in handy when you start working on large projects or need to collaborate with other developers.
There are many programming languages out there that you can choose from. But when you are just starting out with programming, it is best to learn one of the most common languages like Python or Ruby.
These two are known as backend languages and are used to create websites and apps. 
The best part about learning a backend language is that you can use it to create all types of websites and applications.
These languages are also great for creating websites and apps for mobile devices like Android and iOS.

## Conclusion

Javascript is a dynamic and functional programming language that is used for designing interactive websites and applications. It is also a great first programming language because of its simplicity, accessibility, and ease of availability online.
