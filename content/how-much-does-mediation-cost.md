Mediation is often thought of as an alternative to litigation. In many cases, it can be cheaper and faster than going to court. But how much does mediation cost?

The cost of mediation can vary depending on the type of case and the specific circumstances. In some cases, the mediator may charge by the hour. In other cases, the mediator may charge a flat fee.

The cost of mediation may also be affected by whether the parties are represented by attorneys. If both parties have attorneys, the cost of mediation may be higher than if only one party has an attorney.

In some cases, the cost of mediation may be split between the parties. In other cases, one party may be responsible for the entire cost of mediation.

The cost of mediation is usually less than the cost of litigation. Mediation can be an effective way to resolve disputes without going to court.
