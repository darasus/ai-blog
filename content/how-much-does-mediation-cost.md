## How Long Does Mediation Take?

The length of time it takes to complete a mediation session will vary depending on the complexity of the dispute and the number of parties involved. A single dispute involving two parties might be completed in a day. A complex dispute involving multiple parties and/or issues could take many weeks or months to complete.
Mediation methods can vary greatly, but most mediation sessions follow a similar process: First, the parties and their representatives meet with the mediator (or mediators) to discuss the issues in dispute and to agree on the facts and issues in the case. If the parties and their representatives can resolve the issues, they do so at this stage. If they are unable to reach an agreement, the mediator will try to help them narrow the areas of disagreement so they can focus on the facts that remain in dispute. Where necessary, the mediator will then bring in independent fact-finders to help the parties determine the facts in dispute. Following the fact-finding process, the parties return to the mediation session with the mediators to try to reach an agreement. If the parties can reach an agreement, they sign a settlement agreement at the mediation session. If the mediation session ends without an agreement, the mediators will issue a written mediation report. This report will not include any recommendations or conclusions. It will simply summarize the discussions and show which facts the parties agreed on and which facts remain in dispute.

## What is Included in Mediation Costs?

Mediation costs will vary depending on the type of mediation you choose and the number of parties involved, but the mediator will likely charge for the following: Meetings with the parties and their representatives: The mediator will meet with each party, their attorneys, and their witnesses to help the parties narrow their areas of disagreement and determine the facts in dispute.
Regular mediation sessions: While some mediation sessions occur over the course of one or two days, most mediation sessions take place over a longer period of time.
Research and preparation: The mediator will likely research the facts, legal issues, and the applicable laws in your case before the mediation sessions begin.

## Mediation Costs Compared to Litigation Costs

The costs involved in any particular dispute are likely to be higher in litigation than in mediation, but the actual costs will depend on the facts of each case. A mediation session will probably cost less than a single day in court.
The total cost of litigation, however, will depend on many factors, such as the number of issues in dispute, the number of depositions and/or interrogatories to be taken, the amount of discovery to be conducted, the number and type of expert witnesses to be retained, the number of hearings and/or trials to be conducted, the number of hours your attorneys will spend on your case, and so on.
The costs of mediation, on the other hand, will depend primarily on the hourly rate your mediator charges, the length of time it takes to complete the mediation, and the number of parties involved.

## Other Factors That Affect Mediation Costs

The location of the mediator: Mediators who work in major cities will charge higher rates than mediators who work in smaller cities or towns. The type of dispute: The more complex and/or contentious your dispute is, the more time the mediator will need to devote to the case, and the higher the hourly rate will be. The reputation of the mediator or the mediation firm: Mediators and firms that have a good reputation will charge more for their services than mediators and firms with a poor reputation.

## Should You Jump Right to Litigation?

The costs of litigation can be high, but before you sign a contract for mediation, you should determine if the mediation will be successful. Most people enter mediation expecting to reach an agreement, but you should understand that reaching an agreement does not mean that you’ll get everything you want. It does, however, mean that you’ll be able to move forward with your life.

If the other parties are unwilling to negotiate in good faith, you may want to consider moving ahead with litigation. A decision to move ahead with litigation, however, should not be made lightly. If you do decide to move ahead with litigation, you’ll want to consider all of your options, including the timing. You may want to wait until after the mediation to see if the mediation is successful. If the mediation fails, you’ll want to be prepared to litigate as soon as possible.

## Conclusion

There’s a reason why mediation is called alternative dispute resolution. It’s an alternative to the more costly and time-consuming process of litigation. It helps resolve disputes by enabling the parties to sit down with a neutral third party and try to work out their issues. When mediation works, it is a great outcome for everyone involved.

However, when parties decide to head straight to litigation, they often do so because they want to win. They’re so focused on winning that they miss the opportunity to explore settlement options. Although litigation may be the fastest way to a resolution, it is not always the cheapest or best way to solve a dispute.
