summary: "Java is a programming language that can run on multiple devices and
  operating systems. It’s estimated that over 9 million programmers are using
  Java right now. Java is one of the most popular choices for beginners to
  learn. It's a highly adaptable language that is used to create apps, websites,
  software, and programs. In Java, there are seven categories of keywords: data
  type, method, variable, exception, loop, try/catch/finally, and class. These
  are words that can’t be used as normal words in your code. Conditional
  statements are a fundamental part of programming."
intro: >-
  When you’re learning to code, you need to learn the basics before you can
  move on to more complex topics. The most fundamental programming language is
  Java. It’s one of the most important and widely used languages in the world of
  computer science. Many other programming languages are built on top of it,
  making it even more essential for coders.

  If you want to learn Java, you first need to understand basic coding syntax. A lot of people find coding challenging because it requires fluency in a range of characters and symbols that aren’t necessarily common words in English. However, once you get past the unusual appearance of these words, you’ll see that they are actually pretty simple concepts when broken down into smaller parts. Once you understand the basics, everything becomes much easier from here on out!

## What is Java?

Java is a computer programming language. However, while that definition feels very general, it doesn’t really explain what Java is or why it is so important. At its core, Java is a programming language that can run on multiple devices and operating systems. This includes computers, smartphones, and web servers. Java is a language that is used to create apps, websites, software, and programs. It’s one of the most widely used languages in the world. In fact, it’s estimated that over 9 million programmers are using Java right now! That’s why it’s such a popular choice for beginners who are just getting started with coding. It’s a highly adaptable language that can be used in a variety of contexts.

## Java Vocabulary Basics

Before we get into the specifics of how to write code in Java, let’s take a look at some of the most important vocabulary words. This will help you understand the basics of the language, and get you ready to move onto the next sections. If you’re already familiar with the basics of Java, you can skip ahead to the next section.

- Programmer - A programmer is a person who writes code. They use programming languages to instruct computers to perform certain tasks. A programmer is also known as a coder. - Programming language - A programming language is a set of symbols and rules that programmers use to write instructions. These instructions tell computers what to do. There are thousands of different programming languages. Java is one of the most popular choices for beginners to learn. - Syntax - Syntax refers to the rules that dictate how a specific programming language should be written. It’s important to understand the syntax for any programming language you want to write in. This ensures that your code is written in the right way. - Byte- The smallest unit of data in a computer is called a byte. It’s often compared to the size of a letter in an alphabet. A letter in an alphabet can be any one of 26 letters, while a byte can be any one of 256 different combinations.

## Keywords

Keywords are special words in a programming language that have specific meanings, and can’t be used as normal words in your code. This is because they have specific functions that they need to perform. In Java, there are seven categories of keywords: data type, method, variable, exception, loop, try/catch/finally, and class. These are words that can’t be used as normal words in your code. Instead, you need to use their specific symbols. This is so that the computer will know what you are trying to do. It’s also a way to ensure that your code is consistent. If you use the keywords correctly, your code will be consistent with other Java programs.

## Variables and data types

A variable is a piece of data that is stored in your computer’s memory. It can be changed, depending on the situation. A variable can be a single piece of information, such as an employee’s name, or multiple pieces of information, such as an employee’s name, salary, and job title. Java uses variables to represent different types of information. The type of data that variables can be assigned is called a data type. The most common data types in Java include the following: - String – A string is a collection of characters. - Integer – An integer is a whole number without a decimal place. - Boolean – A boolean is either true or false. - Float – A float is a number with a decimal place. - Double – A double is a number with a decimal place. - Array – An array is a collection of data. - Long – A long is a big number.

## Conditional Statements

A conditional statement is a type of code that tells a computer to do something based on a condition. Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming. In Java, conditional statements are written with if, else, while, and switch keywords. The if keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has a single outcome. The else keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has two outcomes. The while keyword is used to write a conditional statement that is repeated. The switch keyword is used to write a conditional statement with multiple outcomes. Let’s break these down so you can understand how they work.

- The if keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has a single outcome. For example, if you want to run a piece of code if a specific condition is met, you write that condition in an if statement. If the condition is met, then the code will run. If the condition isn’t met, the code won’t run. - The else keyword is used to write a conditional statement that has two outcomes. If you want to write code that runs if a condition is met and code that runs if the condition isn’t met, you need to use an if statement and an else statement. - The while keyword is used to write a conditional statement that is repeated. If you want a piece of code to run multiple times, you write the code inside a while statement. While statements are useful for tasks that need to be repeated until a certain condition is met.

## Loops

Loops are a type of conditional statement that allows you to write code that repeats. This can be very useful when you want to run multiple tasks at once. In Java, loops are written with the for, do while, and while keywords. Let’s break down the different types of loops so you can understand how they work.

- The for keyword is used to write a loop that repeats a set number of times. - The do while keyword is used to write a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met. - The while keyword is used to write a loop that repeats while a certain condition is met.

## Conclusion

When it comes to learning how to write code, understanding syntax is the most important first step. Without a basic understanding of how the language works and what you need to do to write code, you’ll get stuck very quickly. Once you have a basic understanding of the syntax, you can move on to more complex parts of coding. From there, it’s just a matter of practice and repetition until you start to feel more comfortable with the process of writing code. There’s a lot to keep track of and remember when learning to code. However, if you break it down into smaller parts, it’s easier to understand and remember what you need to do.
