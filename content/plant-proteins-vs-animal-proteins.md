## Instructions

- It is important to keep track of your progress throughout this assignment, so please keep this document open at all times to track your progress as you go along. Please ensure that the document is saved regularly.

- You will be expected to submit your completed article as a Microsoft Word file (.docx).

- The article should cover all the pros and cons of both, their nutrition value and the impacts on our body. It should have 3 - 5 subheadings with appropriate images and references.

- The keyword density for this article should be around 5-6% . The final document size after compression should not exceed 1 MB.

- This is an assignment to test your ability to work under pressure as well as measure your capacity to manage time efficiently and handle a new task from start to end.

## Plant Proteins

- Proteins are macronutrients that are essential for growth and development of the human body. They are the building blocks of muscles, bones, blood, and skin. They aid the functioning of several organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.

- Proteins are made up of amino acids. Of these amino acids, 9 are essential amino acids that need to be taken in through food. There are 3 types of plant proteins -

- The plant proteins found in legumes, grains, and nuts have all 9 essential amino acids, making it a complete protein source.

- The plant proteins found in soybeans and soy products are equivalent to animal proteins in the sense that they are high in quality.

- The plant proteins found in vegetables, fruits, and grains are low in quality. This means they do not have all 9 essential amino acids, so they need to be supplemented with a complete protein like that in animal sources.

## Animal Proteins

- Proteins are macronutrients that are essential for growth and development of the human body. They are the building blocks of muscles, bones, blood, and skin. They aid the functioning of several organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.

- Animal proteins are those taken from animals such as cows, goats, pigs, and sheep. They are high in quality and are the main source of dietary protein for many people.

- There are 2 types of animal proteins -

- The animal proteins found in fish and fish products are low in quality. They do not have all 9 essential amino acids so they need to be supplemented with a complete protein like that in plant sources.

- The animal proteins found in milk, milk products, and eggs are a complete protein source.

## Comparison between plant and animal protein

- The main difference between plant and animal proteins is in their quality. There are 3 types of plant proteins that are low in quality, and 2 types of animal proteins that are high in quality.

- Plant proteins are low in quality as they are missing 1 of the 9 essential amino acids.

- Animal proteins are high in quality as they include all 9 essential amino acids.

- Another difference between plant and animal proteins is that plant proteins are water soluble, while animal proteins dissolve in fats and cholesterol.

## Pros of Plant Proteins

- Plant proteins are low in quality, but their benefits include -

- They are cheaper than animal proteins.

- They are easily available in all parts of the world.

- They are good for people with allergies as they contain no allergens.

- They promote a healthy digestive system as they are good for the probiotic bacteria that promote good digestion.

- They are easy to digest as they do not contain any allergens.

- They are a good source of fiber that helps in healthy bowel movements and lowers cholesterol.

- They are helpful in weight loss as they make you feel full and satiated for a long time.

- They are helpful in managing blood pressure.

## Cons of Plant Proteins

- Even though plant proteins are low in quality, their cons include -

- They are not as easily digestible as animal proteins.

- They do not contain all 9 essential amino acids like animal proteins.

- They are not helpful for people who have high blood pressure.

## Pros of Animal Proteins

- Animal proteins are high in quality, and their benefits include -

- They are easily digestible.

- They contain all 9 essential amino acids.

- They are helpful for people who have high blood pressure.

- They are good for people with allergies.

- They promote a healthy digestive system.

- They are a good source of protein.

- They are helpful in weight loss.

- They are helpful in managing blood pressure.

## Cons of Animal Proteins

- Animal proteins are good, but their cons include -

- They are expensive.

- They are not easily available in all parts of the world.

## Conclusion

- To conclude, plant and animal proteins are different in many ways. Plant proteins are low in quality as they are missing 1 of the 9 essential amino acids, but their benefits include being cheaper, easier to digest, and good for people with allergies. Animal proteins, on the other hand, are high in quality as they include all 9 essential amino acids, and their cons include being expensive and not easily available in all parts of the world.
