summary: The best sources of protein are plants such as legumes, grains, nuts,
  and seeds - especially hemp, chia, and flax seeds. The benefits of plant-based
  proteins are not just for building muscle - it's an essential part of a
  balanced diet. Plant-based sources also have very low amounts of saturated
  fats, which are linked to a higher risk of heart disease. They are an
  excellent source of fibre and can help reduce the risk of diseases such as
  osteoporosis.
intro: >-
  People have long believed that you should eat more animal protein –
  especially red meat – to build muscle and strength. However, a balanced diet
  with plenty of plant proteins is essential for any health-conscious
  individual.

  A balanced diet is crucial if you want to stay fit and healthy. That’s because your body needs a variety of nutrients - such as vitamins, minerals, and fats - from different sources in order to function optimally. When one type of food is over- or under-consumed, the consequences can be negative.

  On the other hand, plant proteins are an important source of essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the human body. These compounds are found abundantly in plant foods such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans, peas, and other nuts and seeds.

## What are protein sources?

Proteins are the building blocks of life. They are found in every cell of the body and serve a wide variety of functions.
Most people associate proteins with muscle growth, but they are also important for the immune system, metabolic functions, blood clotting, hormone production, and tissue repair.
The best sources of protein are plants such as legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds - especially hemp, chia, and flax seeds.

Other plant-based sources of protein include soy products, legumes, and whole grains, Other plant-based foods that contain protein include broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, cucumber, garlic, kale, nuts, potatoes, pumpkin, squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and zucchini.

## Why is protein so important?

Protein is an essential macronutrient that provides energy, immunity, and a feeling of fullness.
People who lead an active lifestyle require more protein in their diet. It helps build muscle and repair tissue, which is essential for athletes and fitness enthusiasts.
People who are recovering from an injury or are at risk of developing osteoporosis should also consume more protein. Protein can also help with weight management, especially when you consume it in combination with healthy fats.

Protein is not just for building muscle - it's an essential part of a balanced diet. Your body needs it to stay healthy and function properly. Protein can be found in lots of different foods, including meat, fish, dairy products, beans, and legumes. It's important to eat a wide variety of proteins because each food offers a different mix of essential amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and need to be present in the right amounts for the body to function properly.

## The benefits of plant-based proteins

They are an excellent source of fibre. Fibre is essential for a healthy gut and can help prevent diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Plant-based sources also have very low amounts of saturated fats, which are linked to a higher risk of heart disease.

They are a good source of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Most vitamins are water soluble, which means the body doesn’t store them. That’s why it’s important to consume enough vitamins through food every day. Minerals such as iron, zinc, and calcium can also be found in plant-based foods. Antioxidants are very helpful for the body. They can slow down the process of aging and fight certain diseases. Blueberries, spinach, and tomatoes are some examples of foods that contain a high amount of antioxidants.

## The benefits of animal-based proteins

Animal proteins are an excellent source of essential amino acids. They can help reduce the risk of diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and heart disease. They are also a good source of minerals and vitamins B and D.

They are a good source of saturated fats. While one should not over-consume saturated fats, they are an essential part of a balanced diet. They can be very helpful for the immune system and metabolic functions.

They have a decent amount of cholesterol. A moderate amount of cholesterol is essential for the body. It can help with hormone production, improve the immune system, and protect the liver.

## Plant-based proteins for the Fitness enthusiast

These should be the main source of protein in any fitness enthusiast’s diet. That’s because they are easily digested and contain all essential amino acids.

They can help provide long-lasting energy. It’s important to eat enough carbohydrates, but not too many. Otherwise, you’ll get tired quickly, and your workouts will suffer.

They can reduce muscle soreness after a workout. If you exercise regularly, you know how sore you can get. Certain plant-based proteins can help reduce this pain.

## Conclusion

Protein is one of the most important nutrients for a balanced diet, and it can be found in both animal-based and plant-based foods.
While there is no evidence that one is better for you than the other, a balanced diet with a wide variety of proteins can help you stay healthy and fit.
