## Author

John Steinbeck was an American novelist and short story writer. Born in Salinas, California in 1902, he is best known for writing The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men. He won the Pulitzer Prize for The Grapes of Wrath and also the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. He was a committed socialist who wrote many articles and gave speeches in support of workers’ rights – he even wrote a New Deal-type program for the 1940 Presidential election.
Steinbeck was also a keen observer of society and the human condition – themes that are evident throughout his novels. He wrote a variety of fiction genres – from books about the Californian rural working class to stories set during the Great Depression.

## Plot Summary

The novel begins with the Joad family – poor tenant farmers from Oklahoma who have recently lost their land as a result of falling crop prices and the banks repossessing the land. As this is their only means of livelihood, they have nothing left and are forced to leave their home to look for work. Unfortunately, many people in their situation have been forced from their homes as a result of foreclosures.
Steinbeck describes the harsh realities of the journey west in overloaded cars, with very little money or food, and meeting other people with similar situations. A major theme in the novel is the difficulty of moving with a large family and having no money. As a result, the family is forced to camp in fields, work in labor gangs, and move on when they are noticed by the police.
Steinbeck describes how the migrants’ journey west is one of hope and dreams of better opportunities. However, he also describes how their journey is also one of hardship, brutality, and a fight for survival – which was very true at that time.

## Important Characters

Casy – A preacher who is also a member of the group of migrants that includes the Joads. Casy had been a preacher in Oklahoma, but he became disillusioned with religion. As a result, he quit preaching and became a ‘tender of bees’. After joining the Joads, he is arrested and imprisoned for not having a work permit. When he is released he helps to organize the migrants and becomes an important spokesperson for their cause. Casy comes from a poor family, but he is able to empathize with and understand the plight of the poor and migrants. After his death, Casy is replaced by Muley Graves, who becomes the new spokesman for the migrants.

## Key Quotes

Steinbeck uses the words of Jim Casy to describe the plight of all migrants. This is just one of the many quotes that can be used to describe the hardships that the migrants faced.

“Well, we got to get goin’. We got to move, we can’t stay no place. We got to get goin’.”

This quote can be applied to migrants who had no choice but to keep moving. They were forced to keep moving by the harsh reality of no work and no money.

“We’re the people that live. Can’t nobody wipe us out, neither. We’ll go on livin’, and we’ll go on tryin’.”

This quote can be used to describe the determination of the migrants to keep going even though the odds were stacked against them.

## Why Is It Important?

The Grapes of Wrath was published in 1940 at the height of the Great Depression when millions of people were either unemployed or working on a very low income. It was also a time when many Americans were experiencing poverty and hardship, especially migrant workers and the poor.
The novel described the suffering of the workers through the Joad family – a fictional family that was representative of many of the migrants. It also described the conditions of the migrant workers and the brutality they faced. At that time, there were no social security benefits, welfare, or food stamps. If you had neither a job nor money, you had very few options.

## Final Words

The Grapes of Wrath was a popular book at its time and won many awards. It was also made into a movie that also became popular. Its popularity and the attention it gave to the plight of the migrants meant that the government was forced to change its policies.
Steinbeck’s book also contributed to the changing public opinion about labor unions and workers’ rights. As a result of the novel and the support it gave the workers’ rights movement, the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935 that gave workers the right to organize and bargain with employers.
