Even the field of programming is shifting towards more digitized platforms and solutions. In such a scenario, the need for compact programs that can be easily installed and used on any device arises. That\\u2019s where Java packages come into play.\nA package in java is a collection of related classes, interfaces, enumerations, and sub-packages under one umbrella. As you may have already understood from the above explanation, packages are a great way to organize your code into logical units that can be reused across projects. Packages help you avoid naming conflicts with other libraries or programs and help keep related things together so they\\u2019re easier to find later on.
