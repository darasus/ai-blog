summary: The iPhone is the backbone of Apple’s services business. It generates
  massive amounts of revenue for the company and is an essential part of its
  services business. The amount of money Apple makes from iPhone sales every
  year is so great that it actually outstrips the company's other major revenue
  stream. If the iPhone turns out to be a dud, Apple may have a serious problem
  on its hands. The company's executives have been talking up their flagship
  product so much that it almost seems like an unhealthy obsession.
intro: >-
  In its earnings call for the third quarter of 2018, Apple mentioned the
  word “iPhone” more than 50 times. It was by far the most frequently discussed
  topic on the earnings call — even more so than China and tariffs. 

  Nearly everything Apple discussed on that call revolved around iPhone: When asked about concerns over weakness in Greater China, Apple execs responded by talking about how they were bullish on iPhone sales there long term. When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.

  That may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense. Let’s take a closer look at exactly how much power Apple has vested in its iPhone franchise…

## iPhone: A brief history

The iPhone debuted in 2007 as a smartphone that would bridge the gap between computers and telephones. It launched with one of the first app stores to allow easy app discovery on a smartphone. It was a quantum leap in terms of the user experience of mobile phones.
The iPhone’s introduction to the world was, in many ways, a reaction to the growing popularity of feature phones. While smartphone sales were initially muted due to their high cost, feature phone sales were booming.
That all changed in 2007, with the launch of the iPhone. Between 2007 and 2010, smartphone sales exploded from 9% of the market to more than 50%. Apple’s iPhone was a large part of that explosion.

## iPhone addiction isn’t new

Even though smartphone usage was exploding, it was all too easy to dismiss addiction to the device itself as a fad. After all, it was a device that many people had just recently acquired access to, and it took some time for the average user to fully explore the capabilities of a smartphone.
That said, there were some early signs of addiction to mobile devices, especially smartphones. For example, in a study published in 2010, 15% of respondents reported feeling “addicted” to their mobile phones. That may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that respondents were all people who had had mobile phones for at least two years, it paints an interesting picture.

## iPhone makes up nearly all of Apple’s profit

In the tech world, there are few things more closely associated with Apple than the iPhone. After all, it’s been the mainstay of the company’s revenue stream for years.
Indeed, Apple’s dependence on iPhone revenue is so great that, according to one recent report, the company’s services revenue is actually lower than the profit generated by the iPhone.
That’s right: The amount of money Apple makes from iPhone sales every year is so great that it actually outstrips the company’s other major revenue stream.
This is a clear indication that the iPhone is far more than just a device: It’s a key part of Apple’s business model.

## The iPhone is the backbone of Apple’s services business

Apple’s services segment is a huge part of the company’s overall business. It’s the place where Apple earns money from customers who buy Apple devices but don’t buy things like iPhones.
And it’s an increasingly important part of Apple’s business: Services were the only part of the company’s business that grew during the recent quarter.
Indeed, services are so important to Apple’s future that, according to the company’s executives, they’re heavily dependent on the iPhone.

## Conclusion

You don’t have to be a business analyst to see the signs of iPhone addiction at Apple. The company’s executives have been talking up their flagship product so much that it almost seems like an unhealthy obsession. That said, it’s understandable that Apple’s top brass are so obsessed with the iPhone: It generates massive amounts of revenue for the company, and it’s an essential part of the company’s services business. And when you look at the sheer volume of products that Apple has launched, it’s easy to see why they’re so obsessed with iPhone.
Indeed, it’s almost as if Apple has staked its future on the iPhone. If the iPhone turns out to be a dud, Apple may have a serious problem on its hands.
