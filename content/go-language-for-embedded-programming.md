summary: Go is a programming language with a different approach to language
  design. This means that Go has a different way of solving problems that are
  encountered in other programming languages. The language’s robust ecosystem is
  one of the reasons why many developers are choosing to use Go for embedded
  programming. It is easy to read and write code in this language, which means
  that it is suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike, giving
  them the advantage of completing projects much faster. It also has a simple
  concurrency model for projects that involve working with multiple machines or
  need to share data between them concurrently.
intro: >-
  Today, the world of programming is a cut-throat domain. There are so many
  programming languages available in the market that it might seem confusing for
  programmers to select the one that best suits their needs and also caters to
  future needs. 

  Programming is not as simple as it seems, especially when you consider all the different aspects involved with it. It is not just about learning code, but also understanding which types of projects you want to take up and what kind of structure your career will take from here on. So when choosing a programming language, there are certain aspects you need to keep in mind before making your final decision. To help you out with this, we have outlined some of the main pros and cons associated with using Go for embedded programming in this article:

## What is Go?

Another common question that you might be asking yourself after reading the title of this section is, “Is Go a programming language?”. Yes, it is, but what it really is, is a programming language with a different approach to language design. This means that Go has a different way of solving problems that are encountered in other programming languages. Go was released back in 2009 by Google. It was made with the intention of being a software engineering language, which means that it is mainly used for creating software systems. If you have heard of C, then you will have a good idea of what this language is all about.

The idea behind designing Go was to build a language that would be fast, easy to use, and have a clean syntax. The fact that it was created by Google also proves that it is a language that is of a quality that is unrivalled by many other programming languages.

## Why use Go for embedded programming?

When selecting a programming language for embedded programming, a number of factors have to be taken into account. Yes, you need to select a language that suits your project needs and also the device with which the software will be running on. In many cases, you might just be using the same programming language that was used to create the device’s firmware. However, in many other cases, you might want to use a different language because of the advantages that it offers. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the advantages of using Go for embedded programming:

- Robust ecosystem - There is no denying that the language’s robust ecosystem is one of the reasons why many developers are choosing to use Go for embedded programming. This ecosystem offers features such as a cross-compilation tool, an automatic memory management system, a large standard library, and much more.
- Easy to scale - Another advantage associated with using Go for embedded programming is the fact that it is easy to scale. If you need to scale your project to more devices or add more functionality to an existing device, using Go will be the best choice.
- Great documentation - Another factor that makes Go a good choice when selecting a language for embedded programming is the fact that it comes with great documentation. This documentation is easy to understand even if you are new to programming, which means that it is suitable for people of all skill levels.
- Open source - Finally, another reason why you should use Go for embedded programming is the fact that it is an open source language. This means that you can benefit from its community as well as make changes or report bugs if required.

## Pros of Go for Embedded Programming

Here, we take a look at some of the main pros of using Go for embedded programming:

- Easy to read and write - The syntax of Go is extremely simple, which means that it is easy to read and write code in this language. This makes it suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike, giving them the advantage of completing projects much faster.
- Simple concurrency model - Another advantage of using Go for embedded programming is that it has a simple concurrency model. This model is suitable for projects that involve working with multiple machines or devices and need to share data between them concurrently.
- Robust toolchain - Go also has a robust toolchain that comes with features such as code coverage and other forms of analysis.
- Great community support - The last advantage that we will discuss here is the fact that Go comes with great community support. This means that you can easily find help or get advice from other programmers if you are stuck at any point during the project.

## Cons of Go for Embedded Programming

Now that you know about the advantages of using Go for embedded programming, it is time to take a look at some of the disadvantages associated with this language:
- Compiler is slow - While it is true that the compiler is robust and can help you deliver high-quality software, it is also slow. This means that you will have to wait a bit longer for the code to be compiled and ready for execution.
- Non-deterministic resource consumption - The non-deterministic resource consumption that we refer to here is the fact that Go is a garbage collected language. This means that at any given time, it might decide to allocate more resources than required. This can affect the performance of your device, so it is important to keep this in mind.

## Conclusion

Finally, we have come to the end of this article. Now, you know everything there is to know about using Go for embedded programming. You also know what the advantages and disadvantages of this language are. Armed with this knowledge, you can now make an informed decision when selecting a programming language for your next project.
