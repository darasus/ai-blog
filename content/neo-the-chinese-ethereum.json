The NEO token is used to pay fees on the network, and GAS is used as a sort of fees for those making transactions on the network. NEO was developed by the Chinese startup called \\u201COnChain\\u201D, and it\\u2019s often referred to as \\u201Cthe Chinese Ethereum\\u201D since it can be used to build the same types of dApps.

However, there are a few key differences between the two platforms. NEO is significantly faster than Ethereum, clocking in at about 10,000 transactions per second (tps) versus Ethereum\\u2019s 15 tps.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"NEO also has a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum, as well as a different fee structure.

For example, NEO has a more robust decentralized application ecosystem than EOS, with over 1,000 applications currently being built on their blockchain. EOS, on the other hand, only has 50 applications currently on their platform.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In terms of speed, security, and scalability, EOS is significantly better than NEO. EOS is able to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world.

While TRON doesn\\u2019t have the same dApp ecosystem as NEO, it\\u2019s more focused on becoming the largest decentralized media platform in the world. TRON\\u2019s goal is to provide users with unlimited content and a free internet.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In terms of technology, TRON also has some key advantages over NEO. For example, TRON\\u2019s network can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, which is about six times faster than NEO.

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future.
