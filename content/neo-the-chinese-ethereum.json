NEO was developed by the Chinese startup called \\u201COnChain\\u201D, and it\\u2019s often referred to as \\u201Cthe Chinese Ethereum\\u201D since it can be used to build the same types of dApps.

However, there are a few key differences between the two platforms.

EOS is able to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world.

TRON\\u2019s goal is to provide users with unlimited content and a free internet.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In terms of technology, TRON also has some key advantages over NEO. For example, TRON\\u2019s network can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, which is about six times faster than NEO.
