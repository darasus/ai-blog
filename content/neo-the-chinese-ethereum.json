The NEO token is used to pay fees on the network, and GAS is used as a sort of fees for those making transactions on the network. NEO was developed by the Chinese startup called \\u201COnChain\\u201D, and it\\u2019s often referred to as \\u201Cthe Chinese Ethereum\\u201D since it can be used to build the same types of dApps. While NEO and Ethereum are both open-source blockchain platforms that are primarily used to create dApps, they both have some clear differences.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"NEO\\u2019s main function is as a smart contracts platform that enables decentralized processes like crowdfunding, voting, etc. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a wider range of uses including decentralized apps, token creation, and even managing other cryptocurrencies.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How NEO Works\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Similar to Ethereum, NEO enables developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on top of their blockchain. However, there are a few key differences between the two platforms. NEO is significantly faster than Ethereum, clocking in at about 10,000 transactions per second (tps) versus Ethereum\\u2019s 15 tps.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"NEO also has a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum, as well as a different fee structure. While Ethereum charges per transaction, NEO charges per amount of computing that is used to \\u201Crun\\u201D the distributed apps. NEO also uses a different mechanism for increasing the network\\u2019s capacity to handle more transactions.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"EOS vs. NEO\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While EOS and NEO are both smart contract platforms that allow developers to build decentralized applications, they have a few key differences. For example, NEO has a more robust decentralized application ecosystem than EOS, with over 1,000 applications currently being built on their blockchain. EOS, on the other hand, only has 50 applications currently on their platform.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In terms of speed, security, and scalability, EOS is significantly better than NEO. EOS is able to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world. Unlike NEO, EOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, which is viewed as more efficient than NEO\\u2019s delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) consensus mechanism.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"EOS Pros and Cons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"EOS is one of the fastest and most powerful blockchain networks in the world. It\\u2019s also packed with features that make it one of the most attractive blockchain networks for developers. However, EOS is also one of the most centralized blockchains in the world. The system is controlled by its 21 nodes, which are \\u201Celected\\u201D by token holders who hold at least 10 EOS.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This situation has caused a lot of controversy, and it\\u2019s a big reason why NEO has recently been gaining popularity. As a \\u201Cdecentralized\\u201D platform, users are less concerned about centralized authorities controlling their data.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"TRON vs. NEO\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"TRON, which is another \\u201Cdecentralized\\u201D network, is aiming to compete with NEO as the Chinese Ethereum. While TRON doesn\\u2019t have the same dApp ecosystem as NEO, it\\u2019s more focused on becoming the largest decentralized media platform in the world. TRON\\u2019s goal is to provide users with unlimited content and a free internet.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In terms of technology, TRON also has some key advantages over NEO. For example, TRON\\u2019s network can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, which is about six times faster than NEO. TRON is also much cheaper than NEO, with TRON\\u2019s GAS token costing only fractions of a penny per token.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"TRON Pros and Cons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While TRON has a lot of potential in the long-term, it\\u2019s unclear if the network can ever catch up to NEO. While NEO has been around for over three years, TRON is still in development. NEO also has a bigger team of developers and is backed by the Chinese government, which could give it an edge in the long run.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"However, one advantage that TRON has over NEO is that it\\u2019s compatible with the Ethereum network, which could help TRON with adoption. With ETH\\u2019s scalability issues, TRON could potentially become more popular as users look for an alternative blockchain to launch their decentralized apps.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Final thoughts\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Overall, EOS and NEO are two of the leading smart contract platforms. Both platforms have a lot of potential, and it will be interesting to see which one ends up becoming more popular in the long run. While EOS and NEO are often referred to as \\u201Cthe Chinese Ethereum\\u201D, there are clear differences between these three projects. NEO is a smart contracts platform that\\u2019s been around for three years. EOS is a newer blockchain network that\\u2019s packed with features.

Each one has its own unique features and potential uses. There are thousands of different investors who have bought into the world of cryptocurrency, and each individual has their own reasons for investing in one coin or another. Some people invest in specific cryptocurrencies because they see a particular use case for that token; others invest in specific coins as a hedge against another token; and some invest based on the technical details and potential future use case for that token. There are many individuals who invest in specific tokens primarily because of their privacy features. Privacy is becoming a very important factor to consider when choosing which cryptocurrency to buy into, especially now that so many nefarious forces are targeting the cryptocurrency community with phishing attacks and hacks.
