Or maybe you\\u2019ve played with people who were so scared of losing that they refused to take any risks? Perhaps you\\u2019ve been on the other side, acting like a jerk just to get your friend mad and force them to win.\nScrubs, control-freaks, cautious nerds\\u2014 there are as many types of board gamers as there are games. It turns out there\\u2019s even more diversity than that. There are people who love word puzzles ( Codenames ), people who prefer their games fast and furious ( Smash Up ), and everyone in between.\nIf you know someone who loves Pandemic but isn\\u2019t so fond of losing, this list is for you.

In 2018, we saw new entries in long-running series like Red Dead Redemption, Assassin\\u2019s Creed, and Halo as well as brand new IP such as Monster Hunter: World, Into the Breach, and A Way Out. It was a year that saw game developers pushed by streaming services like Twitch and YouTube continue to experiment with new ideas and designs while also returning to their roots with older properties.\nThat being said, not all games are created equal. There are excellent games and then there are... others less so. To help you sort through the deluge of new releases this year, Gamers Central has compiled a list of our top ten favorite titles coupled with an even longer list of disappointments that you may want to avoid entirely or at least wait for a sale before picking up.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
