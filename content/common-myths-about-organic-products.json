The main difference between the two is that organic food is produced without synthetic chemicals. These synthetic chemicals were developed to increase crop yield and decrease the time needed to grow the crop \\u2014 not to improve nutritional value. In fact, many of these synthetic chemicals are used to kill pests that would otherwise destroy crops by eating them.\nConventional crops are treated with toxic pesticides and fertilisers. These chemicals are then transferred to our bodies through food and water. Organic crops do not contain any toxic chemicals, so organic food is the healthier choice!\nIn fact, studies have shown that organic produce contains more nutrients than conventionally grown produce \\u2014 especially minerals like potassium, iron and zinc. This is because conventionally grown crops are often exposed to toxic chemicals. These chemicals kill the pests, but they kill beneficial insects, too.\nConventional crops are typically grown in fields that are treated with synthetic fertilisers. These fertilisers are made mostly from gas produced from the decomposition of organic matter. This source of nitrogen is used because it is cheap and easy to transport.\nOrganic crops are grown in fields that have been naturally fertilised with manure or compost. Organic fertilisers are rich in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.

The certification body will send an inspector to the farm to make sure that the farm meets organic standards. After the inspector verifies that the farm is organic, the certification body will send an inspector to the farm once a year to ensure that everything is still up to organic standards.\nCertified organic products are not 100% organic.

They get enough protein from eating beans, lentils, nuts and seeds \\u2014 which are legumes and seeds, respectively.\nPeople who are on a vegan diet are actually at a greater risk of not getting all the essential nutrients they need.

This leads people to believe that organic fruits and vegetables have more nutrients than conventionally grown produce. This is not the case!\nIn fact, conventionally grown produce contains as many nutrients as organic produce \\u2014 they just have different amounts of nutrients.\nBecause organic produce has to go through rigorous regulations, it has to contain the same amount of nutrients as conventionally grown produce.
