The main difference between the two is that organic food is produced without synthetic chemicals. These synthetic chemicals were developed to increase crop yield and decrease the time needed to grow the crop \\u2014 not to improve nutritional value. In fact, many of these synthetic chemicals are used to kill pests that would otherwise destroy crops by eating them.\nConventional crops are treated with toxic pesticides and fertilisers. These chemicals are then transferred to our bodies through food and water. Organic crops do not contain any toxic chemicals, so organic food is the healthier choice!\nIn fact, studies have shown that organic produce contains more nutrients than conventionally grown produce \\u2014 especially minerals like potassium, iron and zinc. This is because conventionally grown crops are often exposed to toxic chemicals. These chemicals kill the pests, but they kill beneficial insects, too.\nConventional crops are typically grown in fields that are treated with synthetic fertilisers. These fertilisers are made mostly from gas produced from the decomposition of organic matter. This source of nitrogen is used because it is cheap and easy to transport.\nOrganic crops are grown in fields that have been naturally fertilised with manure or compost. Organic fertilisers are rich in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. These nutrients are important for healthy plant growth.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Certified organic products are 100% organic.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`When something is \\u2018certified organic\\u2019, it means that it meets the requirements set by a reputable certification body.

The certification body will send an inspector to the farm to make sure that the farm meets organic standards. After the inspector verifies that the farm is organic, the certification body will send an inspector to the farm once a year to ensure that everything is still up to organic standards.\nCertified organic products are not 100% organic. They are only 95% organic and 5% is due to unavoidable contamination. This is because even the best farms cannot completely prevent pests and weeds from contaminating crops.\nWhen buying organic products, look for the USDA Organic seal.

They get enough protein from eating beans, lentils, nuts and seeds \\u2014 which are legumes and seeds, respectively.\nPeople who are on a vegan diet are actually at a greater risk of not getting all the essential nutrients they need. This is because they do not get enough vitamin B12 \\u2014 which is a nutrient that is found mostly in animal products. Eating B12 is essential because it helps with DNA replication and proper neurological function.\nPeople on a vegan diet should be careful to eat enough B12. They can do this by eating foods fortified with B12 \\u2014 such as plant-based milk, B12-enriched vegetables and B12-fortified nutritional yeast.\nPeople who eat meat and fish can still get enough B12 from these products, so they don\\u2019t have to worry about this myth spreading to them.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Organic food has greater nutritional value and is better for you.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`This is yet another myth about organic food that has been spread for years.

This leads people to believe that organic fruits and vegetables have more nutrients than conventionally grown produce. This is not the case!\nIn fact, conventionally grown produce contains as many nutrients as organic produce \\u2014 they just have different amounts of nutrients.\nBecause organic produce has to go through rigorous regulations, it has to contain the same amount of nutrients as conventionally grown produce.

It does not use synthetic pesticides or fertilisers, which are harmful to the environment, water and bees.\nContamination is one of the biggest problems with conventionally grown produce and the environment. Pesticides used in conventional farming are known to be toxic for both humans and animals and are found in the groundwater.\nOrganic farming does not utilise pesticides, so the groundwater is pesticide-free \\u2014 and therefore healthier for all living things.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Concluding words: Bottom line\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Organic food is not better than conventional food. Organic and conventionally grown foods both possess the same amount of nutrients. Organic produce is just grown without synthetic pesticides and fertilisers. These pesticides can kill bees and other insects. Organic food is better for the environment because it does not use pesticides. Organic food is better for you because pesticide residues are not found in it. Now that you know the facts about organic food, what are you waiting for?

What\\u2019s hot today could be yesterday\\u2019s news tomorrow. But whether you follow food trends or not, your customers will expect you to stay on top of what\\u2019s currently in vogue. So how should you deal with food trends? Do we follow them? Ignore them? Or just give them a lukewarm response?\nFollow food trends if it makes sense for your business, and use them as a way to stay ahead of competitors and gain new customers. Following trends gives your business an opportunity to attract new customers by keeping your place relevant with the latest tastes and preferences. At the same time, ignoring popular foods can also be risky as that can alienate potential patrons who are looking for those options when they come to dine at your establishment.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If so, you\\u2019re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. However, not all types of fish have the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of your diet.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
