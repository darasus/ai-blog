The scandal led to the firings of four Rick Santorum aides and the resignation of Senator Hillary Clinton. The Bush Administration's Iraq War's discrepancy in the Bush Administration was an investigation into White House officials who had misused intelligence to support the war in Iraq. The Snowden leak prompted international debates over civil rights and the appropriate scope of governmental surveillance.",
