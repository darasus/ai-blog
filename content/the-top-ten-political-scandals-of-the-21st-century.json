Even when it fell behind other societies in terms of technological and scientific advancement, it always recovered. Nowhere is this more apparent than today.\nFor the past few centuries, China has slowly but surely been climbing back from a period of relative obscurity. Today, it is once again one of the most powerful countries on Earth, with an economy larger than that of India and a population bigger than any other country except for India and Nigeria. Moreover, as numerous industry analysts and experts predict even further growth in the coming decades. So what exactly has led to this massive resurgence?`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After the failure of the European Constitution in 2005, and following several years of financial crisis, EU institutions and member states have recommitted to strengthening the foundations of European integration. Indeed, a new wave of integration has emerged.\nIn recent years, we have seen a renewed political will among EU member states to tackle common challenges together and further strengthen the European Union. The Paris Declaration on Integration and Human Rights; the Berlin Process on Security and Integration; the Malta Declaration on Social Compact and the Digital Future of Europe are all examples of this new phase of integration.\nWe take a closer look at where Europe is heading with its various endeavours towards greater unity.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Women also account for just 24 percent of state legislators, 28 percent of city council members, and 15 percent of mayors.\nTo make matters more challenging, this imbalance is not only apparent but also more pronounced in the political sphere than in any other industry. In business management, for example, women hold almost half (44%) of executive roles . But in government? They account for less than one-fifth (19%) of state legislators, city council members, and mayors combined.\nAs a result, when it comes to women in politics we often see a lopsided list that skews toward white cisgender able-bodied wealthy educated privileged women who look very little like the rest of us. And while we\\u2019re happy to see these women rising up as leaders within government \\u2014 they are after all our representatives \\u2014 we can do better\\u2026and we must do better if we want our democracy back from the patriarchy that currently controls it so thoroughly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
