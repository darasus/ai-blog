This union of communist states collapsed in 1991 and left many people wondering how such a powerful alliance could fall apart so quickly. The answer lies in the complex nature of the Soviet Union as a union of independent states that also operated as part of a centralized government. When combined with pressures from outside forces, this unique structure led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe rise and fall of the Soviet Union can be traced back to Vladimir Lenin and his Marxist ideology. In 1917, Lenin led the Bolshevik Revolution and gained control over Russia. At this time, he also introduced policies that would help establish communism throughout Russia and other areas \\u2013 known as \\u201Cthe fourth partition\\u201D \\u2013 controlled by his Red Army. These policies included state ownership of land and businesses; heavy taxes on landowners; centralization; and controls on trade, production, wages, prices, accounting, exchange rates and foreign currency transactions.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Both powers were still locked in a nuclear arms race that had begun after World War II and continued for decades. There was no obvious way out of this dangerous rivalry \\u2013 until that October, when Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\nAs a reformer rather than an ideologue like his predecessors, Gorbachev understood that continuing on this path could lead to catastrophe for his country. In December 1985, he traveled to New York City for a summit with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. At their first meeting, which took place in a small purple room at the UN headquarters, they began what would become a fundamental shift in international relations.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
