summary: Elizabeth sings about reminiscing about that special moment when it all
  began with lines like “Reminding you of something you forgot.” “Dark Spring”
  is the perfect blend of the Beach House we know and love and the change we saw
  on their last two albums. “Lemon Glow” carries some of the melodies from
  “Bloom”, Beach House’s first album released in 2008. The sixth track on the
  album is a beautiful love song that feels like the perfect end to the first
  half of the album.
intro: >-
  Beach House’s seventh album, titled “7” after the number of tracks and
  the band members, is a dreamy masterpiece. Not every song on the album is as
  brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing
  listen as a whole.

  If you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's "Thank Your Lucky Stars" and 2018's "6". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences. 

  On "7", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.

## Track-by-Track Review

This album starts off on a high note with “Dark Spring”. This is track number one and the title track, a perfect introduction to Beach House’s take on dream pop on this record. It’s a song about the start of a relationship. Elizabeth sings about reminiscing about that special moment when it all began with lines like “Reminding you of something you forgot.” “Dark Spring” is the perfect blend of the Beach House we know and love and the change we saw on their last two albums.

The second track on the album is “Dive.” This is the first single from the album released back in October of 2018. “Dive” is one of the more upbeat songs on the album and one of the best as well. It’s a song about falling in love, with lyrics like “You fell in love with the sound of the ocean.” This song is a great example of how this album is both nostalgic and fresh at the same time. Something Beach House do so well.

The third track on the album is the second single released, “Lemon Glow”. This is one of the more electronic-sounding songs on the album and the first instance of Beach House’s trademark layered harmonies coming through. This is also the first hint of nostalgia that comes from this album, as “Lemon Glow” carries some of the melodies from “Bloom”, Beach House’s first album released in 2008.

The fourth track on the album is “Skipping”. This is another one of the more upbeat songs and a return to the Beach House we know and love. This song isn’t about falling in love like others on the album, it’s about staying in love.

The fifth track on the album is “Girl of the Year”. This is one of the more interesting choices of song order on the album. It’s one of the slower songs but it has a lot of energy. It’s about the anxiety of being in a relationship and feeling like you’re being held back by the girl you love.

The sixth track on the album is “Drinking Coffee”. This is a beautiful love song that feels like the perfect end to the first half of the album. This song is about reminiscing on the moments that brought you together and feeling lucky someone is in your life. It’s a beautiful song with a catchy chorus, great guitar riffs and a simple yet effective drum beat.

The seventh track on the album is “Lurking”. This is one of the more “out there” tracks on the album, mostly thanks to the synthesizer-heavy instrumental. This song is about the moments that make you feel anxious, like waiting for a phone call or a text from someone.

The eighth track on the album is “Tremendous Darkness”. This is a slower and more moody track about accepting the feelings we have that we aren’t always proud of. It’s a song about knowing that you can’t always hide from the things that make you feel bad, but you also can’t let them control you.

The ninth and final track on the album is “Days of Candy”. This is a softer and more minimal track compared to the rest of the album. It’s a song about the things you do to distract yourself from your own thoughts and how easy it is to forget how short life can be. It’s a very sweet and thoughtful way to end the album.
