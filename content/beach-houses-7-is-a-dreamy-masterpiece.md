## Musically, '7' is a departure from their earlier work

Part of the reason that this feels like such a different album for the band is that there are no guitars on the record. That's probably not a surprise to those who have followed Beach House's work over the years - they've never been a guitar-heavy band. Their sound has always been more about texture, mood, and atmosphere.

This time around, on '7', the focus is more on the rhythm section, creating a more electronic and beat-driven sound, while Victoria Legrand's voice floats above it all, creating that familiar dreamy and melancholy mood that has become the band's signature sound.

## Dreams and Solace

The first track, 'Dark Spring', is a gentle and slow-moving start to the record, full of dreamy sounds and rhythms that are almost indiscernible. This track gives us the sense that we are drifting and floating through the record, like we're in a dream.
This feeling continues through the next track, 'Lemon Glow', which is as much a sonic collage as it is a song.
This is followed by 'Dive', which, as the title suggests, feels like a descent into something warm, comforting and inviting.

These first three tracks on '7' really set the tone for the whole record. They feel like moments of solitude and introspection. In the middle of the day, when the sun shines bright, but there is a cool breeze, too. It's a moment when one can rest and feel calm, but also dream a little.

## Depression, Loss and Identity

The next two tracks, ' Pink-Orange ' and ' Mine ', bring a shift in mood and tone, with 'Pink-Orange' being a more somber and thoughtful track, and 'Mine', offering a sense of closure and moving on.
This is followed by ' Wedding Bell ' and ' Wishes ', which deal with loss, and a sense of mourning.
This is continued by ' Morning Fog ', which is a beautiful, but sad track that finds Beach House once again creating a sonic collage. There are samples of what sounds like the ocean, a woman breathing, and even an insect flying by the microphone.
This leads into ' Drunk Birds ', which is about the search for identity.

## Overall Recommendation: A Dreamy Masterpiece

' 7' is a masterpiece and a truly wonderful record. It is everything that Beach House fans have been waiting for, and is sure to win over many new converts to the band.
