It may take a little research, but you can often find healthier options on menus.\nTry packing your lunch when you can, or eating at a friend\\u2019s house rather than going out.

Food journals are often used as a way to track and modify diet patterns, and can be very effective at helping people lose weight. A food journal can be as simple as writing down what you ate every day. Or, it can be more complex and involve calculating the calories, vitamins, and minerals of each meal.\nA research study found that people who consistently track their food intake lose more weight than those who don\\u2019t. This is likely because people who consistently track their food intake are more mindful of what they\\u2019re eating.\nWhen you\\u2019re diligent about writing down everything you eat, you\\u2019ll likely make better choices.

However, some people, such as those who are pregnant, need even more.\nYou don\\u2019t need to eat vegetables plain and alone. There are plenty of ways to get your daily vegetables.
