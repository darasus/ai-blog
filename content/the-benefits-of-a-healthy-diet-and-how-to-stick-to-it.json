It\\u2019s hard to get kids excited about eating their vegetables, but luckily there are plenty of tricks that make it easier.\nAddressing their senses is a good place to start. The sense of smell and taste are the primary drivers of our desire to eat one thing or another. Kids love things that look, smell, feel and taste good. The trick is finding ways to incorporate these elements into nutritious meals so they want to eat them.\nOne way parents have been able to do this is by using smoothies as an opportunity to add hidden veggies into their kid\\u2019s diets without them knowing it. And, since you\\u2019ll be using green smoothies as the base for your drink\\u2014not just any old sweet smoothie\\u2014it won\\u2019t add any sugar or calories that you don\\u2019t want in there.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
