This is especially the case if you\\u2019re experiencing performance issues. You don\\u2019t want to start making changes to your JVM that could negatively impact your application\\u2019s performance and then not know what caused it.

The heap is the space that the JVM uses to store objects. As your program is running, it\\u2019ll create new objects and release old ones. These objects are stored in the heap. The JVM is responsible for deciding when to create new heaps and how large to make them.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Most of the time, this process works well.

Code caching is when you cache sections of code and don\\u2019t re-compile them each time they\\u2019re needed. This is generally a good thing, but it can cause issues with your app if you\\u2019re not careful. Code caching can also be referred to as bytecode caching. It\\u2019s important to note that code caching isn\\u2019t specific to the JVM. It\\u2019s a common practice used in all programming languages. When you compile your app, you can load the bytecode into your JVM and then cache it. This means that the next time that particular code is run, the bytecode is already loaded and doesn\\u2019t have to be compiled again. This saves a lot of time when running your application.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But there are ways to go about code caching that can cause issues. One common mistake is caching the bytecode for your entire app. Caching bytecode for your entire app can cause issues if two or more different classes need to be compiled at the same time. This is because only one compiler can be used at a time. If another class is being compiled, the bytecode for the rest of the app is cached and isn\\u2019t available for the other classes. If you cache the bytecode for your entire app, it can cause performance issues and make debugging harder.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Java compiler options\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When you\\u2019re writing Java code, there are compiler options you can use to change the way your code is compiled. These compiler options can vary from platform to platform and from compiler to compiler. But they can have a big impact on the performance of your Java application. There are two compiler options that have a significant impact on performance. These are the -Xss and -Xmx options. -Xss : This option controls the amount of memory allocated to the thread-safety stack. The thread-safety stack is used during the thread execution to ensure that thread interactions are safe and don\\u2019t cause issues for other threads in the JVM. If you set the value for this option too low, you may run into issues with the JVM throwing out of memory exceptions. If you set it too high, you may increase your JVM\\u2019s overhead.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"-Xmx : This option controls how much memory the JVM can use.

To use interpreter mode, you can add the \"-Xinterpreter\" flag to your JVM. When you use interpreter mode, the JVM doesn\\u2019t translate your bytecode into machine language. It keeps your application in the Java language and instead uses a single thread to run your application. This allows you to see if there are any bottlenecks in your application that are caused by the JVM itself.\nInterpreter mode can also help identify slow API calls and any issues with code caching.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In the first article of this series, we discussed how Java performance tuning can be complicated.
