This is especially the case if you\\u2019re experiencing performance issues. You don\\u2019t want to start making changes to your JVM that could negatively impact your application\\u2019s performance and then not know what caused it. Taking the time to set up a baseline will help you identify changes and draw conclusions as to what made a difference.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can use a variety of tools to measure your app\\u2019s performance. You can use the built-in profilers that are included with your JVM. There are also a number of open-source tools that can help you measure your performance and provide insights into bottlenecks.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"JVM heap size and platform performance\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The first thing we\\u2019ll discuss when it comes to tuning the JVM is heap size. The heap is the space that the JVM uses to store objects. As your program is running, it\\u2019ll create new objects and release old ones. These objects are stored in the heap. The JVM is responsible for deciding when to create new heaps and how large to make them.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Most of the time, this process works well. But if your heap size is too small or your system is under heavy load, the JVM can\\u2019t keep up and performance will suffer. When your application is experiencing poor performance and you notice that the JVM is using a lot of processor time and taking a long time to complete tasks, increasing your heap size may help.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Code caching\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the first steps in Java performance tuning is to look at how you use code caching. Code caching is when you cache sections of code and don\\u2019t re-compile them each time they\\u2019re needed. This is generally a good thing, but it can cause issues with your app if you\\u2019re not careful. Code caching can also be referred to as bytecode caching. It\\u2019s important to note that code caching isn\\u2019t specific to the JVM. It\\u2019s a common practice used in all programming languages. When you compile your app, you can load the bytecode into your JVM and then cache it. This means that the next time that particular code is run, the bytecode is already loaded and doesn\\u2019t have to be compiled again. This saves a lot of time when running your application.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But there are ways to go about code caching that can cause issues. One common mistake is caching the bytecode for your entire app. Caching bytecode for your entire app can cause issues if two or more different classes need to be compiled at the same time. This is because only one compiler can be used at a time. If another class is being compiled, the bytecode for the rest of the app is cached and isn\\u2019t available for the other classes. If you cache the bytecode for your entire app, it can cause performance issues and make debugging harder.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Java compiler options\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When you\\u2019re writing Java code, there are compiler options you can use to change the way your code is compiled. These compiler options can vary from platform to platform and from compiler to compiler. But they can have a big impact on the performance of your Java application. There are two compiler options that have a significant impact on performance. These are the -Xss and -Xmx options. -Xss : This option controls the amount of memory allocated to the thread-safety stack. The thread-safety stack is used during the thread execution to ensure that thread interactions are safe and don\\u2019t cause issues for other threads in the JVM. If you set the value for this option too low, you may run into issues with the JVM throwing out of memory exceptions. If you set it too high, you may increase your JVM\\u2019s overhead.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"-Xmx : This option controls how much memory the JVM can use. If you set this value too low, you\\u2019ll run into issues with the JVM throwing out of memory exceptions. If you set it too high, you\\u2019ll increase your JVM\\u2019s overhead.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Use API\\u2019s with fast-path code in them\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`There are parts of your Java code that will be used often, and there are others that will only be used occasionally. If you have an API call that\\u2019s used often, you may be able to speed it up by adding fast-path code.\nIf you\\u2019re using a Java API and it\\u2019s creating a new thread for every call, it\\u2019s not using fast-path code and it can have a negative impact on your application\\u2019s performance. Adding fast-path code to these API calls can help improve performance by eliminating the overhead of creating a new thread for every call. You can add fast-path code by using the Java code-generation tools or by using a platform-specific API.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Use interpreter mode to check for bottlenecks\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Interpreter mode is a handy feature of the JVM that you can use to check for common bottlenecks. To use interpreter mode, you can add the \"-Xinterpreter\" flag to your JVM. When you use interpreter mode, the JVM doesn\\u2019t translate your bytecode into machine language. It keeps your application in the Java language and instead uses a single thread to run your application. This allows you to see if there are any bottlenecks in your application that are caused by the JVM itself.\nInterpreter mode can also help identify slow API calls and any issues with code caching.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In the first article of this series, we discussed how Java performance tuning can be complicated.

A software tester conducts tests to evaluate the quality of software or website features by giving users different possible inputs and measuring the outputs against a pre-determined expectation. Software testers attempt to find bugs before your users do. They are like Quality Control for software development. Their job is to make sure that every piece of code meets its functional specifications, whether it\\u2019s user authentication or any other feature of your application.\nIf you have not started testing your Java applications yet, we suggest you start soon!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In simple terms, we want to cut down the time between a code being written and it being ready for production.\nWe often see developers writing messy codes that are difficult to read or understand. The same goes for Ops engineers who find it challenging to debug different errors in production. This is where the Go language comes into play.\nSince its launch in 2009, Go has gained immense popularity among software developers across the globe, who have even dubbed it \\u201Cthe new old thing\\u201D. It was developed by Google as an alternative to other languages that were slow and memory-intensive at that time.\nIf you are a developer looking forward to implement DevOps with the help of Go, this article is for you!
