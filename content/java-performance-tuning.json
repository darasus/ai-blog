The heap is the space that the JVM uses to store objects. As your program is running, it\\u2019ll create new objects and release old ones. These objects are stored in the heap.

Code caching is when you cache sections of code and don\\u2019t re-compile them each time they\\u2019re needed. This is generally a good thing, but it can cause issues with your app if you\\u2019re not careful. Code caching can also be referred to as bytecode caching. It\\u2019s important to note that code caching isn\\u2019t specific to the JVM. It\\u2019s a common practice used in all programming languages. When you compile your app, you can load the bytecode into your JVM and then cache it.

This saves a lot of time when running your application.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"But there are ways to go about code caching that can cause issues. One common mistake is caching the bytecode for your entire app. Caching bytecode for your entire app can cause issues if two or more different classes need to be compiled at the same time. This is because only one compiler can be used at a time. If another class is being compiled, the bytecode for the rest of the app is cached and isn\\u2019t available for the other classes.

These compiler options can vary from platform to platform and from compiler to compiler. But they can have a big impact on the performance of your Java application. There are two compiler options that have a significant impact on performance. These are the -Xss and -Xmx options. -Xss : This option controls the amount of memory allocated to the thread-safety stack. The thread-safety stack is used during the thread execution to ensure that thread interactions are safe and don\\u2019t cause issues for other threads in the JVM.
