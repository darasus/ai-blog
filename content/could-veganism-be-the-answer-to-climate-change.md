summary: Veganism is a lifestyle that seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation
  of, and cruelty to, the environment, animals, and humans. Vegans have a
  primarily plant-based diet, and avoid foods that are processed or derived from
  animals. Climate change is a phenomenon that has the potential to destroy our
  planet as we know it. The damage caused by climate change is irreversible;
  it’s something that we can’t adapt to or recover from. Some would argue that
  veganism does more harm than good to the environment.
intro: >-
  Today, more than ever before, people are starting to take responsibility
  for their actions as individuals and as a society. The phenomenon of social
  consciousness is becoming more apparent and accessible to everyone, and it’s
  now easier than ever to understand the ethical and environmental implications
  of our actions.

  Even though most people are now aware of the role that climate change plays in destroying the planet and reducing its biodiversity, very few are taking actionable steps to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing waste and using cleaner energy. In addition to this, there is no singular answer or solution to reversing the effects of pollution on our home planet; rather, it will require an amalgamation of many different initiatives working together simultaneously.

  One such initiative is veganism. A plant-based diet has a number of positive benefits on the environment — mainly because raising livestock produces a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. If we all stopped eating meat it would have a huge effect on carbon dioxide levels, deforestation rates, and natural water courses.

  As you’ll discover from reading this article, veganism could be the answer to climate change; however, there are also some drawbacks. This article explores all angles so that you can make an informed decision whether you’d like to become vegan or not.

## What Is Veganism?

First, it’s important to clarify the definition of veganism. “Veganism is a lifestyle that seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, the environment, animals, and humans. Vegans have a primarily plant-based diet, and they try to avoid foods that are processed or derived from animals.”
In other words, vegans don’t eat meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products — and they avoid using leather, wool, and silk too. In addition to this, they may also avoid using products that have been tested on animals.

## The Basics of Climate Change

Climate change is a term used to describe the continuous change in climatic patterns and their impact on the environment.
One of the key factors that contributes to climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2) – a potent greenhouse gas. Essentially, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas. This carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere, trapping solar radiation and raising the planet’s temperature.

## So, Why Should We Care About Climate Change?

Climate change is a phenomenon that has the potential to destroy our planet as we know it — and it’s an issue that we can no longer ignore.
What most people don’t realize is that the damage caused by climate change is irreversible; it’s something that we can’t adapt to or recover from.
The most dangerous aspect of climate change is that it is a slow-moving process; so slow, in fact, that it’s difficult for people to notice the effects of it. At the moment, the planet is experiencing a rise in global temperatures — and these will continue to increase as long as we keep burning fossil fuels.
If we don’t start taking responsibility now and reducing our carbon footprints, the effects of climate change will become so severe that they’ll have a permanent impact on the planet’s biodiversity and ecosystems.

## Research Shows that Veganism Could Be the Answer to Climate Change

Veganism could be the answer to climate change because the movement encourages people to eat less meat — which, in turn, reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
You’re probably thinking: “But meat is a source of proteins, right? Protein is essential for growth and development – therefore, vegans won’t grow properly without it!”
Veganism does not mean that you have to starve yourself and consume no nourishing foods. Veganism is about eating more wholesome, natural foods and reducing your intake of processed foods and refined sugars.
Veganism encourages you to eat more fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds — foods that are rich in proteins and essential minerals and vitamins.

## But There’s a Catch…

Before we get too excited and start joining the vegan bandwagon, we must point out that veganism isn’t a perfect solution to climate change.
First, the carbon dioxide that we produce when we burn fossil fuels is a lot more harmful to the environment than the CO2 that we release through digestion. Secondly, researchers have discovered that growing vegetables uses massive amounts of water — and it’s water that could be used to sustain other plants and crops.

## Final words: Should You Go Vegan to Help Reverse Climate Change?

The short answer is: maybe.
As we’ve seen, veganism is not a perfect solution to climate change. It has its advantages, but it also has its flaws. Some would argue that veganism does more harm than good to the environment — and it is certainly not an easy lifestyle to maintain.
Indeed, veganism can be challenging to live with — but it’s also rewarding and worthwhile. Veganism encourages people to eat more wholesome foods and take better care of their bodies — and this is something that everyone can benefit from.
