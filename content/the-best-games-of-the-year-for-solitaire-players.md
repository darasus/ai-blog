If you’re a sports fan and love solitaire, then you’re in for a real treat with this one! This game combines solitaire with baseball, so it’s basically like playing two games in one. You can play a game of solitaire to get your mind off the baseball game that you’re missing on TV while you wait for it to come on again. There are three levels of difficulty to choose from, and you can also select from a variety of card backs to keep it varied and interesting. This game plays like a solitaire version of a baseball card collecting game, in which you collect all the team cards in order to win.

## Klondike Solitaire

For those who love the classic solitaire game but want a challenge, this version of the game is for you! This game is majorly different from the classic game in that it uses one deck of cards.

It includes special abilities, items, and other things from the show to make it more interesting and exciting. This game is great for the avid solitaire player and fan of the show alike.

## Double Exposure

For those who love a challenge and variety, this is the perfect game for you! This game is played with two decks of cards and has a completely different layout and rules than a normal solitaire game.
