summary: Go is a programming language that was designed by Google engineers in
  2007. Go ranks directly behind Java as one of the most popular programming
  languages used by software engineers. Go is mainly used to build backend
  services like APIs and microservices, which are software applications that run
  on one or more computers to perform a specific task. Go can be used to create
  websites, but it is not the most ideal choice for this purpose. It is an
  excellent language for creating web applications that are used by engineers
  within a company to manage data and perform various tasks.
intro: >-
  If you are a programmer who loves to solve problems with your code and
  thinks of new ways to make it more efficient, you may want to consider
  switching to a career in software engineering. With the recent heightened
  awareness of data breaches and cyber security concerns, there has been an
  increased demand for software engineers who specialize in developing solutions
  for information technology (IT) departments.

  There are many software development languages out there that you can learn to build applications for various purposes, including creating desktop programs, websites, or mobile apps. If you’re interested in working as an administrator in a company’s IT department and developing code for its website and other related services, Go might be the perfect programming language for you. In this article, we will explore why Go is an excellent choice if you want to build applications for web administration.

## What is Go?

Go is a programming language that was designed by Google engineers in 2007. It is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to create many different types of applications, including web applications. In terms of popularity, Go ranks directly behind Java as one of the most popular programming languages used by software engineers. Go is mainly used to build backend services like APIs and microservices, which are software applications that run on one or more computers to perform a specific task. It is also used to build tools that help engineers build other software applications. Go can be used to create websites, but it is not the most ideal choice for this purpose. It is, however, an excellent language for creating web applications that are used by other engineers within a company to manage data and perform various tasks.

## Why is Go Good for Web Development?

To understand why Go is a good choice for developing web applications, let’s first take a look at some of its key features and how they can be beneficial for web development: 

    While these features make Go an excellent choice for building web applications, it is also important to understand what programming languages are used for in general. 

     If a language is primarily used for writing backend services, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is a bad choice for writing web applications. The most important thing when choosing a programming language for any type of application is to understand its strengths and why it is the best choice for that particular need. 

    

## Go at a Glance

As we mentioned, Go is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to build software applications for web services, desktop programs, and mobile apps. The following are some of the key features of Go that make it an excellent choice for developing software applications: 

       Since Go is a general-purpose programming language, it can be used for many different things. Depending on the type of application you want to build, you can use one or more of its features and combine them with other languages. 

Programmers who want to write code in Go can download and install it on their computer. They can then use this programming language to create any type of software application they want. 

       

## Pros of Using Go for Web Development

Go is a general-purpose programming language that is primarily used to build backend services, APIs, and microservices. Depending on the type of application you want to build, you can use one or more of its features and combine them with other languages. Let’s take a look at some of the pros of using Go for web development: 

             

## Cons of Using Go for Web Development

While Go is an excellent choice for web development, it doesn’t have any specific features that make it better than other programming languages. It is a general-purpose language that can be used for many different types of applications. 

                

## How to Learn Go?

If you want to become a software engineer and build software applications using Go, you first need to understand how programming languages work and what they are used for. There are many online tutorials, books, and courses that will help you learn the basics of programming with Go. Once you have a solid understanding of how programming languages work and what they can be used for, you can start building your own software applications. If you are keen to build applications for web services, you can start by learning the basics of building APIs with Go. Once you have a good idea of how APIs are built and how they work, you can move on to building microservices with Go. Alternatively, if you have an interest in developing websites, you can also use Go for this purpose. However, you will need to combine it with a different programming language that can be used for the front end.

## Conclusion

Go is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for many different types of applications, including web applications. It is primarily used to build backend services, APIs, and microservices. Depending on the type of application you want to build, you can use one or more of Go’s features and combine them with other languages. When choosing the right programming language for any type of application, it is important to understand its goals and why it is the best choice for that particular need.

Now that you know what Go is and why it is a good choice for web development, you can decide whether it is the right programming language for you.
