The Go programming language is an open source project created by Google. It is a compiled, statically typed language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

The Go programming language was created to address the problems that Google was having with its large, monolithic codebase. The company was looking for a language that would be easy to maintain and would scale well. Go was designed to be a systems programming language, but it has also been used for web development and other tasks.

Go is a great choice for web administration because it is easy to learn and use. It is also very efficient and can handle a large number of requests. Go is a great choice for any system that needs to be scalable and efficient.
