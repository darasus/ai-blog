If you\\u2019re thinking about starting a juicing regimen but aren\\u2019t quite sure where to start, we have just the thing for you.\nWe love juicing because it gives us an easy way to get lots of vitamins and minerals that we might not be getting from our other meals. The best part? Juicing is cheap (or free if you grow your own produce), easy and fast. You can make a glass of juice in less than 5 minutes without much prep work involved.\nJuicing also means that you\\u2019ll probably consume more fruits and vegetables than you would in any other form. This article covers everything you need to know about juicing including why it\\u2019s good for you, the different kinds of juicers available on the market today, how many calories are in different types of juices, and some awesome recipes to get you started!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But what if we told you that almost everything you think you know about food is wrong?\nCrazy, right? Well, it might come as a surprise to learn that the best foods for weight loss are actually unprocessed natural foods\\u2014not magical chemicals and supplements.
