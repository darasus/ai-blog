  "summary": "The first track is a fun summer vibe with acoustic guitar and a bass line that will make you want to dance. The lyrics are about being happy in the moment and not worrying about tomorrow because you donâ€™t know what it will bring. This song is a little darker than the first with lyrics about trying to forget a bad situation, but being unable to escape it. It features a heavy drum beat and a haunting synth melody. It's about needing a body guard because the world is a scary place.",

But there are still some great pop albums that aren\\u2019t filled with auto-tune and EDM drops.On May 25th, the Scottish band Chvrches released their third album called \\u201C Love is Dead.\\u201D The synth-pop band has lots of happy vibes and catchy hooks on their new album. It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
