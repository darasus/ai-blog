It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In 1951, he was convicted of \\u201Cgross indecency\\u201D and chemically castrated as punishment. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide. This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days.

In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.

An unhinged social experiment?\nPerhaps all of these things. Let\\u2019s break it down.\nThe \\u201CIn My Feelings\\u201D challenge basically involves someone standing in a public place and dancing along to Drake\\u2019s new song, \\u201CIn My Feelings.\\u201D If they are not at home or in their own car, they will have to record this dance and post it online for all their followers to see.

What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives. The result is something like a documentary on human development \\u2014 funny, sad, awkward, and everything in between \\u2014 presented through the lens of an intimate cinematic experience.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Rather than any superficial discussion of how many different kinds of people there are or whether one kind is better than another, it is an examination of what it means to be an individual in society by exploring the challenges that arise when one appears to be something they are not.\nThe plot follows the life and loves of two women; poor southern waitress Nora (Lilac) and her daughter Sarah who is being raised by her business-minded father George (Thomas). Nora\\u2019s light-skinned daughter falls for local boy Harry (Swayze), who does not know she also has darker blood. Meanwhile, George falls for Vida (Stapleton), a rich blonde socialite who will only marry him if he passes as white.\nImitation of Life offers commentary on racial identity, classism and even pansexuality through these characters, providing insight into their experiences and highlighting inequality wherever it exists.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
