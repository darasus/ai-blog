Assuming you would like an article discussing tips on how to train your dog to allow you to groom them: 

1. Start early. It's easier to train a puppy to accept grooming than it is an adult dog. If you have a puppy, start the grooming process as soon as possible.

2. Be gentle. Dogs can sense when you're being rough with them and they're more likely to resist if they think you're going to hurt them. Be gentle and take your time so your dog doesn't get anxious.

3. Use treats. Dogs love treats, so use them to your advantage! Give your dog a treat after each successful grooming session to reinforce good behavior.

4. Be patient. Training takes time and patience. Don't get frustrated if your dog doesn't seem to be progressing as quickly as you'd like. Just keep at it and eventually they'll get the hang of it.
