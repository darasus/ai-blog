## What you will need

Before you even begin to groom your dog, you need to make sure you have all of the tools you’ll need to do so. You’ll want to have an appropriate brush for your pet’s fur, as well as a comb for their fur if their fur is particularly long. You’ll also want to have a good pair of scissors for trimming their fur, as well as a good pair of clippers to help you get all of their fur off if it’s particularly long.

You’ll also want to have the right shampoo and conditioner to clean your pet and make sure they’re clean and healthy. If your pet has particularly curly or long fur, you’ll also want to have a brush for that. If your pet has particularly sensitive skin or fur, you’ll also want to get some shaving cream for sensitive skin that will help prevent irritation.

## Commands and Rewards

The first step in training your dog to allow you to groom them is to teach them that grooming is a positive thing. To do this, you’ll want to first start by giving them a verbal command such as “relax” or “stay” when you’re about to groom them. You can either say the command aloud or use a clicker to symbolize a reward. This will allow your dog to associate the action of grooming with a positive command, which will help encourage them to relax while you do so.

Next, you’ll want to reward your dog every time they follow your grooming command. You can do this by giving them a small amount of their favourite treat or even just petting them. By doing this, you can train your dog to associate the grooming command with a reward, which will help them to relax more during grooming.

## The Touch-Up Brush

The first step in grooming your dog is to brush out all of their fur. This will help to get out any tangles, mats, or other things that may be caught in their fur and could cause them to get uncomfortable. When you first start grooming your dog, you’ll want to brush out their fur with a regular touch-up brush. You can either do this by brushing out their fur while they lie on the ground or sitting on the ground with them. You’ll want to do this until all of their fur is untangled. This will help to get out any mats or tangles that have formed in their fur.

If you notice any mats or tangles forming in your dog’s fur, don’t hesitate to get them out right away. Mats and tangles can be very uncomfortable for dogs, and they may even be prone to infections if they aren’t removed. After you finish brushing out all of their fur, you can then move on to trimming their fur.

## The Big Shampoo and Dry

The next step in grooming your dog is to give them a thorough bath. After you finish brushing out all of their fur, you can then put your dog in the bathtub, put some shampoo in the water, and wash their fur thoroughly. You’ll want to make sure you clean their fur, as well as their paws and the insides of their ears. After you finish washing your dog, you can then let them air dry or use a hair dryer to dry them off.

This is an essential part of grooming your dog, as it will allow you to get them clean and remove any bacteria or other things that may be living in their fur. It’s important that you give your dog a thorough bath at least once per month to make sure they stay healthy. You can do this once every two weeks if you want to give them a bath more often.

## The Short Cut

After you finish giving your dog a thorough bath, you can then use clippers to give them a short cut. This will help to quickly and easily groom your dog, as well as help them to stay cool during the warm summer months. Start by brushing out all of your dog’s fur, then put clippers in whichever setting they need to be in to cut the fur they have.

Brush out your dog’s fur again before you begin cutting their fur. You may want to put a mat remover tool on the clippers before you begin cutting their fur to help remove any mats that may be forming. Once you finish cutting their fur, you can then use a comb to style their fur the way you want it.

## Conclusion

As you can see, grooming your dog isn’t always an easy task. While it is important to keep your dog well groomed, it can be a challenge if your dog is uncooperative or doesn’t like being groomed. If your dog struggles with grooming, there are several tips and tricks you can use to help train them to allow you to do so.

You’ll want to first start by giving them a verbal command such as “relax” or “stay” when you’re about to groom them. You can either say the command aloud or use a clicker to symbolize a reward. You can then use a touch-up brush to brush out all of their fur, followed by a thorough bath, ending with a short cut. By doing this, you can train your dog to relax during grooming and make the process much easier for both of you.
