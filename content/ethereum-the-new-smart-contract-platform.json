One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future.
