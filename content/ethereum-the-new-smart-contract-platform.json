Ether currently has a total market cap of over $20 billion and is the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. This alone is proof that Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin.\nEthereum's goal is to create a decentralized world computer that can execute any program on a global network.
