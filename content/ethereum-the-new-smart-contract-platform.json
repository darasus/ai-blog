Ether currently has a total market cap of over $20 billion and is the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. This alone is proof that Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin.\nEthereum's goal is to create a decentralized world computer that can execute any program on a global network.

Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server.

While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators.
