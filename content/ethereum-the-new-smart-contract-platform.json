Ethereum is an open-source blockchain network used to power smart contracts. Ether is the native cryptocurrency used with Ethereum. Ether has a fixed supply of 100 million coins, but Ethereum's network is able to scale according to demand. Ether currently has a total market cap of over $20 billion and is the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin. This alone is proof that Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin.\nEthereum's goal is to create a decentralized world computer that can execute any program on a global network. This is possible because Ethereum's network is built with thousands of computers connected together with a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is what executes Ethereum's smart contracts.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Does Ethereum Work?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Ethereum's network consists of thousands of computers around the world that use Ethereum's Virtual Machine to execute decentralized apps. Each computer contributes to the network's processing power and also stores a copy of the blockchain that records all Ethereum transactions.\nEthereum's Virtual Machine is run on each node where it executes smart contracts.

This also causes Ethereum to be slower than networks without Turing complete programming capabilities, which is why it\\u2019s important to acknowledge the tradeoffs.\nEthereum\\u2019s tokenization feature is also a huge plus.

Ethereum\\u2019s scalability has been a big issue that the team is currently working to resolve.\nEthereum also uses a lot of energy because mining is so profitable.
