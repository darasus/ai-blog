An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so. Let us explore how we can leverage interfaces in our code to make it more modular, reusable, testable and readable.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
