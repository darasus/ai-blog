This is especially true of the brain, which is one of the most energy-intensive organs in our bodies. It requires a large amount of glucose via the blood stream in order to function properly.

Famous people like Marie Antoinette, Thomas Jefferson, and even Oprah have been utilizing this technique to achieve peak performance. However, most of us tend to overlook it as something boring or ineffective. But, in reality, time blocking is a surefire way to boost your productivity and increase your output.\nTime blocking isn\\u2019t just about scheduling your day with blocks of activities. It\\u2019s all about keeping track of the amount of time you spend on specific tasks throughout the day. To do so, you should list down all the tasks you need to complete during that specific day and allocate a dedicated time slot for each activity you want to finish by the end of that day.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It often means that we aren\\u2019t making time for things that are actually important, like building new relationships or dedicating time to personal development.
