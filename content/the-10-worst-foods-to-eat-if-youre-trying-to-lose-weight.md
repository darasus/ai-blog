## Bacon

Bacon is often touted as being a “healthy” food because it’s low in carbs. But what about the high amount of fat, sodium, and calories from fat? That’s a lot of bad stuff packed into one slice of bacon. If you’re trying to watch your weight, bacon is not the best choice for a snack. It’s also not very nutritious, so if you’re not eating it for the flavor, there are better, more filling choices out there. If you’re craving bacon, you could try making a healthier version at home.

## Doughnuts

Doughnuts are often associated with our childhoods — maybe a birthday, or maybe even getting a doughnut while we were in the car with our parents. But if you’re trying to lose weight, those doughnuts aren’t doing you any favors. Doughnuts are high in calories, sodium, and fat, and they’re also pretty low in protein and fiber. You could make a healthier version at home by baking some donuts with a low-fat glaze or icing.

## Potato Chips

Potato chips are delicious, salty, crunchy snacks — but they’re also one of the worst foods to eat if you’re trying to lose weight. Potato chips are loaded with calories, sodium, and fat.  If you’re eating just a small serving (about 10 chips), that amount of chips is about 150 calories — and that’s without any dip. If you’re trying to lose weight, potato chips aren’t a very good choice. But you can make healthier versions at home. You can also try baked chips if you’re craving the crunch but not the fat.

## Ice Cream

Ice cream is a dessert that’s both decadent and delicious. It also happens to be one of the worst foods for losing weight. Ice cream is high in sugar, fat, and calories. A small bowl of ice cream with a few toppings has about 500 calories — which is a huge amount to eat in one sitting. If you’re trying to lose weight, it’s best to avoid ice cream. But hey, you don’t have to be deprived of creamy desserts! There are healthier alternatives out there. You could try making a low-sugar ice cream at home with a can of coconut milk.

## Shrimp

Shrimp is often touted as a healthy seafood because it’s low in fat and calories. But it’s also low in protein, which means it’s not a very filling choice for a meal. Shrimp is also high in sodium, which can cause you to retain water, making you look bigger. If you’re trying to lose weight, shrimp isn’t the best choice. You could try other types of seafood, or use a low-fat sauce or dressing to flavor the shrimp and make it more filling.

## Cheese Fries

Cheese fries are often served as appetizers in restaurants. With the melted cheese, they’re a delicious, gooey treat. But if you’re trying to lose weight, cheese fries are definitely one of the worst foods for you. They’re high in calories and fat, and they don’t fill you up for long. If you’re trying to lose weight, cheese fries aren’t a good choice. But if you’re craving them, you could try making them at home with a healthier cheese.

## Cake

Cake is something we often associate with birthdays and celebrations. But if you’re trying to lose weight, cake isn’t the best choice. Cake is loaded with sugar and fat. A slice of cake can have around 500 calories — and that’s just one slice! If you’re trying to lose weight, cake is a treat that should be eaten rarely, if at all. But if you’re craving cake, you could try making a healthier version at home.

## Corned Beef Sandwich

If you love a good deli sandwich, you might be eating the worst foods to eat while trying to lose weight. Many deli meats are high in sodium and fat, and they’re not very filling. A corned beef sandwich can have as many as 900 calories! If you’re trying to lose weight, deli meats aren’t the best choice. You could try other types of meat or make a healthier version at home.

## Conclusion

Everything in life is about balance. You shouldn’t try to be perfect 100% of the time. Instead, you should make the healthiest choices you can for the majority of the time. Then, you can make some exceptions every now and then. Eating badly every once in a while won’t harm you. In fact, it can help you reset your cravings and allow you to make better choices in the long run. The key is to not make a habit of it. Eating badly every day is one of the worst things you can do if you’re trying to lose weight.
