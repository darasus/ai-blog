summary: There are three main types of dog grooming - bath and brush, full
  groom, and full groom and haircut. Each type has its own benefits that go
  beyond just cleaning your dog. If you start grooming your dog from a young
  age, it will be easier for both of you as they’ll be used to the process and
  will be less likely to put up a fight during grooming. Trimming and cleaning
  the ears, cleaning the eyes, clipping the nails and de-matting and brushing
  the coat of your dog is just as important as bathing them.
intro: >-
  Dogs are naturally clean animals, but their fur can get dirty and oily
  over time. If left unattended, this dirt and oil will cause your dog to smell
  and leave them more susceptible to infections. Grooming your dog regularly can
  also help you identify any problems they might have with their skin or fur
  early on. To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every
  one to three months. 

  The benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence. The process is not only beneficial for the dog but also for you as an owner as it gives you time to build a stronger bond with your pet.

## Types of Dog Grooming

There are three main types of dog grooming - bath and brush, full groom, and full groom and haircut. Each type has its own benefits that go beyond just cleaning your dog.
Full groom - This includes trimming and cleaning the ears, cleaning the eyes, clipping the nails and de-matting and brushing the coat of your dog.
Full groom and haircut - This is the most thorough type of dog grooming. This includes all of the above plus a haircut and blow dry.
Bath and brush - This type of dog grooming is ideal for dogs with short, soft coats. This does not include clipping the nails.

## Start Grooming from a young age

If you start grooming your dog from a young age, it will be easier for both of you as they’ll be used to the process and will be less likely to put up a fight during grooming.
If you start grooming your puppy when they’re around 8 weeks old, they will be used to the process by the time they’re an adult dog. The earlier you start grooming, the easier it will be for both of you as a pup doesn’t have the same strength as an adult dog.

If you wait until your dog is older, you’ll have to deal with more resistance and it can be harder to calm them down.

## Brush your dog regularly

Brushing your dog is just as important as bathing them. Regular brushing helps to get rid of the shed fur, dirt and any potential allergens.
You can either use a rubber brush or a comb. Make sure to brush your dog’s fur in the direction of the hair growth, as brushing against the growth can damage your dog’s skin and cause painful sores.

Regular brushing will help to reduce shedding, prevent mites and fleas, and keep your dog’s coat healthy. If you notice matted fur on your dog, don’t wait until the next grooming session, but try to brush them as soon as you can to prevent discomfort and pain.

## Use a rubber brush

A rubber brush is a great addition to your regular grooming routine as it has even more benefits. It can be used on your dog’s entire coat, not just the top layer. Besides brushing away shedding fur, it can also be used as a massaging tool to relieve stress and stimulate blood circulation. It can also be used as a bath scrubber for dogs that like to get dirty.

A rubber brush is helpful for dogs with thick, dense coats or for dogs with sensitive skin. It won’t create any pulling or snagging on their skin, but will still get their fur clean.

## Shampoo and condition your dog’s fur

For dogs with long or curly fur, you can use a dog conditioner instead of shampoo. If your dog’s fur has a dark colour, it is a good idea to use a shampoo that has a whitening effect. Dogs with black fur can sometimes appear grey due to the build-up of dirt and oil. If you shampoo your dog too often, it can dry out their skin and reduce their fur’s ability to protect them against the cold.

For short-haired dogs, you can simply use regular shampoo instead of a special dog shampoo. You can condition the fur of short-haired dogs, but make sure to use a very small amount as it can make their fur too oily.

## Use a dryer or blow dryer on low heat

You can use a dryer or a blow dryer to dry your dog’s fur. Just make sure to use it on low heat and that the nozzle is covered with a diffuser so it doesn’t get too hot.
Using a dryer or a blow dryer is a great option if you want to speed up the drying process. It is also a good choice if you have a large breed of dog since you can use one tool to dry both their fur and the fur on their legs and paws.

If you use a dryer, make sure to use a diffuser to prevent your dog’s fur from getting too hot or tangled. You can also use a comb to remove fur from the brush.

## Trim your dog’s nails and fur with nail clippers and scissors

Regularly trimming your dog’s nails and fur around the paws, eyes, and ears can help to prevent infection. Besides this, it can also improve your dog’s walking and running technique as it reduces the pressure on their joints. To trim your dog’s nails, you can use a special dog nail clipper or you can use a human nail clipper on your dog. If you use a human nail clipper, you should use the biggest size possible. This will prevent you from cutting too far and hurting your dog.

You can also use nail clippers to trim the fur around your dog’s eyes and ears. This will help your dog to see better and protect their sensitive areas. You can also use scissors to trim the fur on your dog’s face if they have long whiskers.

## Conclusion

Dogs are man’s best friend, but they are also our responsibility. Grooming your dog is a great and easy way to keep them happy, healthy and clean. Besides providing basic hygiene for your dog, grooming them can also help you identify any potential issues that might arise in their skin or fur. It is important to start grooming your dog from a young age to make it easier for both of you. If you start grooming your dog when they’re a puppy, they will be used to the process and much less likely to put up a fight during grooming.
