As of June 2018, there are approximately 3.4 billion users globally, with that number continuing to grow by the day. With so many different people using the internet, it\\u2019s no surprise that big tech companies have begun to thrive once again.\nAt its core, the internet is an exchange of information between computers. In practice, this means a website like Google can store all of its user-friendly information online and anyone who wants to access it simply needs to type in a URL or visit a site directly. However, as more people use the internet and begin interacting with various programs and applications on websites, things become slightly more complicated.\nAs you probably know if you browse social media sites or read news articles online frequently, there are now several different \\u201Clanguages\\u201D being used on websites to make them more interactive. These programming languages are known as HTML5, CSS3, JS/JavaScript, and JSON \\u2013 all acronyms that stand for something but might not mean much to most users at first glance.\nHowever, these languages make up what is known as web content management systems (WCMS). A WCMS is essentially software that allows developers to create websites of any kind without having to code each page from scratch every time they want to launch a new one.\nHere\\u2019s a brief breakdown of what big tech companies and the future of the internet look like today:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Beyond its \\u201Cfree\\u201D services, Google makes money through advertisements on its own websites, apps, and partnerships with other brands.\nWhile some people are concerned by Google\\u2019s increasing control over the internet, the company is known for prioritizing user privacy and treating its employees rather well. In fact, Google has been named one of the best companies to work for several times now \\u2013 something that\\u2019s almost unheard of in the tech industry.\nGoogle\\u2019s growth is helping to shape the future of the internet as a whole.

The social media giant made headlines in the past year thanks to its data breach scandal, which saw personal information being accessed illegally by third parties.\nWith the controversy and data breach still fresh in people\\u2019s minds, the future of Facebook remains uncertain. Many users have been deleting their accounts, and it\\u2019s unclear whether they will ever come back.\nNot only does Facebook have a lot of control over the internet, but it also has a huge influence on people\\u2019s lives. Some have argued that the social network is addictive and can damage the mental health of its users.\nMore recently, Facebook has been trying to diversify its business model. The company has been investing in new technologies, such as virtual reality, that will help it remain relevant in the future.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Twitter\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Twitter is a social networking website that allows users to post short \\u201Ctweets,\\u201D or microblog posts, of up to 280 characters.

The site has also been around for close to a decade, making it one of the oldest social media websites.\nWhile Twitter\\u2019s future seems secure and only likely to grow, some have questioned whether the site\\u2019s microblogging format will remain relevant in the long run.

The company\\u2019s AWS services are used by many other websites and apps, and it has also been investing in artificial intelligence research.\nAmazon has also been involved in a number of controversies, including hosting content that promotes hate speech and selling facial recognition software to law enforcement.

It has allowed people to communicate freely and collaborate on a scale never seen before in human history.\nAt the same time, it has also given rise to misinformation and fake news.
