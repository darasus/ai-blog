When the winter blues start to set in, there are a few things you can do to try and beat them. First, make sure you are getting enough sunlight. Spend time outside every day, even if itâ€™s just for a few minutes. Secondly, exercise regularly. Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Third, eat healthy foods and avoid processed foods and excessive amounts of sugar. fourth, spend time with friends and family and do things you enjoy. Finally, if you are still struggling, talk to your doctor about possible treatments such as light therapy or medication.
