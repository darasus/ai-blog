  The winter blues is a mood disorder that can affect anyone, not just
  people from northern regions. Symptoms of the winter blues are essentially SAD
  (seasonal affective disorder) brought on by the shorter days and colder
  temperatures of winter. If you find yourself feeling blue during the colder
  months but don’t necessarily have a reason to be, you might have the winter
  blues. The good news is that you can combat this feeling with a little help
  from your friends and some lifestyle changes. 

  Whether you have or have had the winter blues in the past, there are ways to boost your spirits when those long, dreary days of January creep up on you like an old friend you don’t want to see again. Here are some ways to beat those pesky winter blues and get back to your happy self!

## Exercise

Exercising in the winter months can be a tricky proposition. After all, who wants to go running outside in the freezing cold? Nobody, that’s who. But luckily, there are plenty of ways to get your exercise on inside, no matter how cold it gets outside.

From yoga to Zumba, there are so many ways to exercise indoors and reap all the health and mood benefits that come with it. Even if you’re not particularly into group exercise, you can always try out some simple at-home workouts! And don’t worry about not getting enough light when you exercise indoors. A study conducted by Harvard Medical School found that 30 minutes of bright light is equivalent to 60 minutes of regular light. So, you’ll still get plenty of light even when you’re in the comfort of your own home!

## Light Therapy

Light therapy is a great way to treat the winter blues. Also known as phototherapy, light therapy uses bright light therapy to treat seasonal affective disorder. You can find light therapy lamps in many health and beauty stores. When using a light therapy lamp, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

When choosing a light therapy lamp, look for one that has 10,000 lumens and a wavelength of either blue or white light. You’ll also want to consider the size and price of the lamp. Other light therapy products include light boxes, visors, and blankets. These products deliver light directly to your eyes.

Light therapy can help improve your mood and energy levels by increasing serotonin and dopamine levels in your brain.

## Eat Well

As with most health issues, the best way to beat the winter blues is to eat well. You’ve probably heard this one before, but it’s true! Eating a balanced diet high in fruits and vegetables will help to boost your mood, energy levels, and immune system. A healthy diet should consist of about 50% fruits and vegetables, 25% whole grains, and 25% lean proteins.

You don’t have to go all-out healthy if you don’t want to, but try to keep your diet balanced. Healthy foods can help to raise your serotonin levels, which will make you feel happier and more positive. Junk food, on the other hand, is full of chemicals that can actually lower your serotonin levels, making you feel more depressed.

## Take Care of Yourself

When you’re not taking care of yourself, it’s easy to get caught up in the winter blues. But you don’t have to let the winter weather get the best of you! Try to stay as active as you can, even if it means squeezing in shorter workouts.

Make sure to get plenty of sleep, too. Getting enough sleep will help your body to repair and rejuvenate after all that cold weather stress. It will also help to lower your stress levels, which will make you feel a lot happier in general.

You can take other steps to take care of yourself, too! Take time to meditate, book a massage, or find other ways to relax and destress.

## Surround Yourself With Friends

If you’re feeling the winter blues coming on, try to surround yourself with friends as much as possible. Get together with old friends, meet up with new friends, or even take a trip somewhere to visit friends you haven’t seen in a while. Being around people you love and care about will help to boost your mood and increase your happiness levels. Not to mention, getting out of the house will make you feel less trapped as winter comes creeping in.

You can also try to find new ways to connect with friends in your area. Try joining a club, taking an interesting class, or making plans to attend an event with friends. This will help you to meet new people while also keeping in touch with old friends!

## Conclusion

The winter blues can be a drag, but not if you know how to beat it. In order to beat these pesky winter blues, you’ll need to exercise, eat well, take care of yourself, and surround yourself with friends. The best way to do that is to pick one or more of these activities and do them every day!

If you’ve been feeling blue during the winter months, don’t worry: you aren’t alone. Winter blues are common among many people, and there’s a way to beat them. Follow these tips, and you’ll be feeling back to your happy self in no time!
