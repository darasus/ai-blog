The key here is to think about what types of foods you want to eat and when you want to eat them. Make a schedule for yourself and try to keep to it as much as you can. If you\\u2019re in school and have classes from 9-5 every day, you\\u2019ll want to make sure you have time to make and eat your meals.

This will save you time and money and make it easier to eat right. Another way to get your hands on healthy foods is to meal prep.

Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles and other tissues in your body. If you don\\u2019t get enough in your diet, you can become weak and sick more easily. This can be especially important for teens and young adults who are still growing and therefore have higher protein needs than adults.

When you\\u2019re eating healthy, you\\u2019ll want to make sure you have plenty of vegetables in your diet. Some vegetables are healthier than others, of course. The best vegetables to eat are those rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These include broccoli, spinach, Swiss chard, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, and lettuce.
