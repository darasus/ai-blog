Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future.
