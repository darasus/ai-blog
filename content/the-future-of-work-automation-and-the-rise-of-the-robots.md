summary: Automation is the use of machines or computer-controlled equipment to
  perform operations normally done by humans. Automation can be used in any
  industry, including manufacturing, distribution, and healthcare. Robots are
  used to perform repetitive tasks in industries such as electronics, food and
  beverage, car manufacturing, healthcare, and electronics. The use of robots in
  factories solves the problem of finding specialized labor that is needed to
  operate highly technical machinery. Robots can also be programmed to do tasks
  with greater precision and consistency than humans.
intro: "Digital transformation is a sweeping trend that is reshaping businesses.
  The role of technology has shifted from being a support system to something
  that drives competitiveness and customer experience. In the new digital
  economy, businesses must focus on how technology can transform their current
  services and operations to meet the needs of their customers. The combination
  of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots are transforming the way we work —
  especially in manufacturing and logistics operations. Automation and robotics
  have made it possible for manufacturers to produce more goods with fewer
  workers, while increasing production efficiency and accuracy at the same time.
  These technologies are also reducing labor costs, increasing output, and
  easing recruitment challenges that many manufacturers face in developing
  countries where youth unemployment remains high. But how will this impact work
  in factories change? Let’s explore the future of work: automation and robots"

## What is automation?

Automation is the use of machines or computer-controlled equipment to perform operations normally done by humans. Automation can be used in any industry, including manufacturing, distribution, and healthcare. It can be used to control the operation of equipment, such as in the construction of a pipeline or the production of steel. It can also be used to create a feedback control system to regulate the temperature of a chemical reactor.
## Robotics in manufacturing

Robots are programmable machines that automate physical processes. These machines are often used to perform repetitive tasks in industries such as electronics, food and beverage, car manufacturing, and healthcare. For example, in a car manufacturing plant, robots would be responsible for removing engines from a conveyor belt and fitting the engine into a car. The use of robots in factories solves the problem of finding specialized labor that is needed to operate highly technical machinery. Robots can also be programmed to do tasks with greater precision and consistency than humans. The robots used in the manufacturing industry are generally classified into two categories: collaborative robots and automation robots. Collaborative robots are designed to work with humans and are suitable for light work environments. They are easy to program and operate, and can be programmed to conform to the movements of workers. Automation robots, on the other hand, are programmed to perform repetitive tasks on their own. They are ideal for environments where workers have to wear protective gear as they do not have the ability to adapt to the movements of humans.

## Benefits of Automation and Robotics in Manufacturing

Increased production and output: Automating production processes can increase overall output by at least 25%. This is largely due to the reduction in production defects and improved quality of goods.

Cost savings: The implementation of automation in manufacturing results in cost savings through lower energy and operational costs.

Flexibility: The ability to quickly switch between production runs can provide manufacturers with significant flexibility as they respond to changes in supply and demand.

Safety: Enabling workers to handle hazardous tasks while reducing their risk of injury can help companies reduce the cost of workers’ compensation claims.

## Road to automation and robotics in factories

Companies are using automation in their operations to improve productivity, increase accuracy in production, and reduce costs. Robotics, in particular, is gaining popularity as businesses realize that it can help them achieve these outcomes with greater ease than other automation techniques. Here is how automation and robotics has been implemented in production environments across industries:

- Food and beverage: To tackle the challenge of increasing demand for healthy, organic food, manufacturers are increasingly investing in automation and robotics to produce large quantities of products quickly and precisely. This is particularly true in the case of frozen and chilled foods, where automation is applied to the freezing process and packaging, as well as for beverage production, where it is used for bottling and canning operations.

- Pharmaceuticals: The industry is experiencing a R&D boom as manufacturers race to develop new drugs. To keep up with growing demand, they are adopting automation and robotics to improve efficiency and consistency in production.

- Textiles: The apparel industry is one of the highest users of automation, with 88% of clothing apparel manufacturers using automation.

- Discrete manufacturing: Automation and robotics are being increasingly deployed in discrete manufacturing operations, including in the automotive and electronics industries, where they are used in assembly lines and for testing and inspection.

## Challenges of automation and robotics in the workplace

While automation and robots have proven to be effective in improving production, they have also come with challenges for workers. Automation has been linked to the loss of jobs across the manufacturing sector, with experts predicting that millions of workers could lose their jobs to robots in the coming decades. Although manufacturers say automation is necessary to remain competitive and profitable, critics say that the loss of human labor is a major issue that needs to be addressed.

## Conclusion

The future of work will be driven by automation and robotics. As technology advances, it is becoming possible for machines to not only replicate many human actions but also outperform humans at them. Although AI and robotics are expected to create millions of jobs, they will also replace millions of others. Although the future looks promising, there is still a need for policy makers and business leaders to create an environment conducive to the adoption of these technologies.
