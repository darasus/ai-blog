It\\u2019s also helpful to decide what you\\u2019re going to eat before you enter the kitchen. Sometimes the mere act of opening the fridge can make it harder to stick to your healthy eating plan.\nMost people make healthy meal plans on paper, but you can also use an online diet app like MyFitnessPal to streamline the process.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t Fear Leftovers\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Many people assume that leftovers are unhealthy, but that\\u2019s not the case if you make smart choices.

Root vegetables are important, but they shouldn\\u2019t be the only vegetables in your diet.\nFor example, you might want to include peppers in your diet once a week. Or, if you enjoy cabbages, you could make a point of eating it at least a couple times a month. Rotating your vegetables will help you avoid getting bored with your meals.
