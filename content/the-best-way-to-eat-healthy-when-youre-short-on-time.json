It doesn\\u2019t leave much room for eating right.\nFortunately, there are lots of ways to keep your diet in check while also fitting in your hectic schedule. Keeping healthy snacks like fruits and nuts stocked at home can help you avoid getting hungry at the worst possible moment.

It\\u2019s easier to make healthy choices when you know what\\u2019s coming up instead of reacting to whatever happens to be in the fridge. It\\u2019s also helpful to decide what you\\u2019re going to eat before you enter the kitchen. Sometimes the mere act of opening the fridge can make it harder to stick to your healthy eating plan.\nMost people make healthy meal plans on paper, but you can also use an online diet app like MyFitnessPal to streamline the process.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t Fear Leftovers\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Many people assume that leftovers are unhealthy, but that\\u2019s not the case if you make smart choices.

Foods like pasta, rice, and potatoes can all be re-heated in a microwave, but other items may require a stovetop re-heat.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Many experts recommend eating leftover foods as a way to lower the cost of your diet, but be sure to make healthy choices when you\\u2019re re-heating. Avoid things like fried foods, fatty sauces, and heavy gravies that weren\\u2019t healthy to begin with.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rotate Your Veggies\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Not all vegetables are created equally. While some are high in fiber and low in calories, others are heavy and rich in calories. It\\u2019s not uncommon to see people falling into a rut where they eat the same vegetables every week. That\\u2019s fine if you\\u2019re eating healthy options, but it\\u2019s very easy to gradually slip into a pattern where you\\u2019re only eating root vegetables. Root vegetables are important, but they shouldn\\u2019t be the only vegetables in your diet.\nFor example, you might want to include peppers in your diet once a week. Or, if you enjoy cabbages, you could make a point of eating it at least a couple times a month. Rotating your vegetables will help you avoid getting bored with your meals. It\\u2019ll also help you avoid falling into a pattern where you\\u2019re only eating one or two types of vegetables.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go For High-Fiber Vegetables\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Fiber is important for healthy digestion and blood sugar balance, but some vegetables have much more of it than others. In fact, some veggies have no fiber at all, so it\\u2019s important to choose wisely.\nVegetables like kale and broccoli are great sources of fiber, but you\\u2019ll find fewer of these nutrients in lettuce and avocado. It\\u2019s best to focus on eating plenty of veggies like kale and collard greens, as well as whole grains like oats and barley.\nVegetables and grains are two of the easiest ways to boost your daily fiber intake. It\\u2019s also helpful to avoid eating too many whole grains, as they can be rich in calories.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Try Beans and Lentils\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Some people avoid eating beans and legumes because they aren\\u2019t sure how to prepare them. But they happen to be two of the healthiest foods you can eat. In fact, beans have been shown to have just as many health benefits as other protein sources.\nYou can try eating beans in a variety of different ways, including eating them in bean burritos, salads, and in chili. Lentils are another high-protein food that can be used in a number of different dishes. You can try them in soups or stews, or you can use them to replace meat in tacos and burritos.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Keep Healthy Snacks Handy\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Keep a variety of healthy snacks handy so that you can avoid overeating at meals. It\\u2019s important to eat throughout the day, but it\\u2019s also easy to overeat when you\\u2019re eating more meals.\nFor example, if you eat three meals a day and each meal includes a baked potato, you\\u2019ll be getting far more carbs than you need in one day. It\\u2019s important to avoid that by keeping healthy snacks nearby so that you can eat just enough to avoid feeling hungry.\nYou can also try eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day.

You can also buy vegetables that have been pre-cut, which makes it easier to use them in a meal.\nIt\\u2019s important to remember that eating fresh food is always better than eating something that\\u2019s been sitting in your fridge for a long time.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Try A Smaller Plate\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Eating off a smaller plate is one way to trick yourself into eating less food.
