Mediation is a process where two parties in conflict work with a neutral third party to resolve their differences. Mediation is often used in divorce cases, but can be used in any situation where two people are in conflict. There are many different types of mediation, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

The most common type of mediation is facilitative mediation. In this type of mediation, the mediator helps the parties to communicate with each other and to find a resolution to their conflict. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties, but instead helps them to reach their own agreement. This type of mediation is often used in divorce cases, as it can help the parties to communicate better and to reach an agreement that is fair to both sides.

Another type of mediation is evaluative mediation. In this type of mediation, the mediator evaluates the case and makes recommendations to the parties. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties, but instead provides them with information that will help them to reach a resolution. This type of mediation is often used in cases where the parties are unable to reach an agreement on their own.

Mediation can also be used in cases where one party is represented by an attorney and the other party is not. In this type of mediation, the mediator helps the parties to communicate with each other and to find a resolution to their conflict. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties, but instead helps them to reach their own agreement. This type of mediation is often used in cases where the parties are unable to reach an agreement on their own.

Mediation can be an effective way to resolve conflicts. It can help the parties to communicate better and to reach an agreement that is fair to both sides.
