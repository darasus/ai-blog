## What Is General Mediation?

General mediation is a process where a neutral third party facilitates communication between parties who have a dispute but cannot agree on a solution. General mediation can be used in a wide variety of situations, including landlord-tenant disputes, divorces, contract issues, and many other types of disputes.

In most cases, general mediation is an appropriate option for parties who want to resolve their dispute without going to court. This is because general mediation is a voluntary process that is confidential, informal, and inexpensive.
General mediation is often an appropriate approach when both parties are agreeable to using mediation as a way to resolve their dispute.
However, if one party is not on board with mediation, it’s unlikely that the process will be successful.

## Third-party Neutral Mediation

Third-party neutral mediation is a process where an impartial mediator guides parties to an agreement. The mediator is not an advocate or decision-maker, but a neutral third party who facilitates communication between the disputing parties. The mediator’s role is to facilitate communication, gather facts, clarify points of agreement and disagreement, and help the parties reach a mutually beneficial agreement that they are able to execute in a legally enforceable contract.

In order to ensure that the mediator is truly neutral, the mediator must disclose any potential conflicts of interest, such as a past working relationship with one of the parties. The mediator is also expected to maintain confidentiality, as any information disclosed by either party is legally protected information.

## Guided Collaborative Mediation

Guided collaborative mediation is a process where a mediator guides parties to an agreement using a structured communication process. The structured process usually consists of a series of steps that are designed to help all parties involved reach a solution by themselves. The structured process can include exercises designed to help the parties reflect on their goals, explore solutions to the dispute, and come to agreement on an outcome that meets their individual interests.

Guided collaborative mediation is appropriate for disputes where the parties are able to reach an agreement without the help of an impartial third party.

## Hybrid Collaborative-Neutral Mediation

Hybrid collaborative-neutral mediation is a process that blends elements of guided collaborative mediation with third-party neutral mediation. The mediator begins the process as a neutral third party who helps the parties reflect on their goals. As the parties reach agreement, the mediator begins to guide the conversation, encouraging the parties to take the steps necessary to move towards a conclusion.

Hybrid collaborative-neutral mediation is appropriate for disputes where the parties are able to reach an agreement on their own, but are willing to have a neutral third party guide them through any difficult issues they are unable to resolve on their own.

## Expert Team Services (ETS)

Expert team services (ETS) is a process where a team of experts works together to help the parties resolve a dispute. This process is often used in commercial disputes where it may be too costly for one party to hire an expert to provide a single report or analysis. The experts who provide services through expert team services may include engineers, environmental specialists, accountants, medical experts, or other professions who may be necessary to fully understand the dispute.

ETS is appropriate for disputes where the parties are unable to agree on a solution due to a lack of information. The experts who provide services through ETS can provide the information the parties need to move forward towards a solution.

## Conclusion

Mediation is a process where parties resolve conflict and negotiate solutions with the help of a neutral third party. There are many different types of mediation, each with its own set of rules and expectations for participants. Understanding these variations is crucial to picking the right mediation process for your specific needs.
