Casual chain restaurants such as Outback Steakhouse, Chili\\u2019s or Applebee\\u2019s are generally the best bet for people eating a balanced diet. They\\u2019re usually family-friendly and have plenty of options that suit most dietary needs, including special menus for vegetarians, vegans and those with gluten intolerance or allergies.\nYou also want to make sure you check the hours of operation before leaving the house. This is especially important if you\\u2019re meeting friends or colleagues for happy hour or late night.

This will help you avoid making poor choices at the restaurant, which can often lead to over-eating.\nIf possible, visit the restaurant ahead of time to scope out the menu and decide what you\\u2019ll order. If you\\u2019re in a rush, you can also check out the menu online before you go.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you have dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate them to your server.

Don\\u2019t worry, though; there are plenty of options. If you\\u2019re not sure where to start, consider the following factors. Atmosphere - While this may not be a major consideration if you\\u2019re eating solo, or with close friends or family, it can be helpful when you\\u2019re meeting clients or colleagues for business meals. A quiet and casual atmosphere is often best. If you\\u2019re looking for a place that\\u2019s lively and has a fun vibe, though, you\\u2019ll want to find a restaurant that\\u2019s a little noisier. Location - You\\u2019ll want to consider where the restaurant is located. If you\\u2019re meeting clients, or want to be close to work, try to find a place that\\u2019s centrally located. If you\\u2019re going out with friends, though, you may be better off eating at a restaurant that\\u2019s farther away, so you have time to relax, enjoy your food and not have to rush back to the office.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Watch (and ask) What Goes Into Your Food\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`If you\\u2019re curious about how a certain dish is made, or how the chef prepares your seafood or meat, feel free to ask.
