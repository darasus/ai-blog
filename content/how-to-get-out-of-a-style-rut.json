  "title": "How To Get Out Of A Style Rut",
  "summary": "Getting out of a style rut doesn’t have to be complicated or challenging. Try some simple changes before diving into a whole new look. Find new inspiration online and look at style and colour palettes that other people have used. Consider asking for a recommendation based on your skin tone, eye colour and hair colour. Find a new haircut too, but it can be more time consuming and expensive than a new hair colour or style. Consider visiting a cosmetics counter and speaking to the makeup artist about your options.",
  "intro": "The risk of falling into a style rut is something we all have to deal with from time to time. It happens to even the most confident and daring of people, so you’re certainly not alone if you feel like your style is stagnating and you can’t think of anything new or exciting to wear. Whether it’s because you haven’t found a new piece of clothing that excites you in months, or because you just don’t know what to wear after wearing variations on the same theme for several weeks in a row, everyone gets stuck in a rut now and again. Thankfully there are ways to get out of it and discover a new lease on your personal style once again.",
  "content": "## Change up your wardrobe\n\nIf you’re getting bored with your wardrobe, try some simple changes before diving into a whole new look. Try switching up your accessories, or adding a new coat to your collection of warm weather jackets. Adding some new pieces to your wardrobe can make a big difference to your look without requiring a complete style overhaul. Find yourself wearing the same half a dozen outfits every week? Add a new shirt or pair of trousers to the rotation.\n\n## Try a new hair colour or cut\n\nA new hair colour or style can completely transform your look. If you’ve been on the same hair journey for a while, consider changing it up. A new haircut can make a big difference too, but it can be more time consuming and expensive than a new hair colour. A fresh new ‘do can make you feel like a new person, and is also a great way to get out of a style rut if you’ve been sporting the same look for a long time.\n\n## Discover your personal colours\n\nYou can get a better idea of the colours that suit you best by considering your skin tone, eye, and hair colour. If you don’t know what your skin and hair colour are, finding out is relatively easy. There are lots of websites that offer skin tone and hair colour guides, or you can ask a friend or loved one. Once you know, you can apply that knowledge to your choice of clothing, makeup, and other accessories. If you’re not sure where to start, it might be helpful to look at colour palettes that other people have used, and see which colour schemes you prefer.\n\n## Visit a cosmetics counter\n\nIf you’ve been wearing the same makeup look for a while, consider visiting a cosmetics counter and speaking to the makeup artist about your options. Getting a new makeup style can shake up your look and help you get out of a rut. Consider asking for a recommendation based on your skin tone, eye colour and hair colour.\n\n## Network with friends and family\n\nSometimes getting out of a style rut is as easy as talking to the people around you. If you’ve been struggling to find inspiration or new ideas, reach out to friends, family members, or co-workers and ask them what they think you should be wearing. This can often be helpful, especially if you’re struggling to find a new style that feels like it suits you.\n\n## Find new inspiration online\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck, and don’t know where to start looking for inspiration, there are lots of online resources you can use. Look up what other people are wearing, particularly those in the same field as you. There are a multitude of style and fashion blogs out there, so don’t be afraid to search for the styles and themes you like the most. Take a look at style and colour palettes, and try to incorporate some of these into your look.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nGetting out of a rut doesn’t have to be complicated or challenging. With a little ingenuity, you can get yourself back on track when it comes to your personal style in no time at all."
