Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.

To keep your dog healthy and happy, you should groom them once every one to three months.\nThe benefits of dog grooming go beyond a neatly trimmed coat and fresh smelling pet. Regular grooming helps to reduce the risk of infection from bacteria, decreases stress in the animal, stimulates blood circulation and improves self-confidence.
