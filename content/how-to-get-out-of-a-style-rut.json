It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.

They require sustained effort, willpower and courage to see them through. The fact that so few resolutions are kept shows how hard it is for most of us to take that first step and put our intentions into action.\nWe live in a world filled with temptations at every corner. Even if you don\\u2019t like going out or meeting new people, there are endless opportunities online, which makes staying in shape even harder. Keeping fit is not an easy task in this modern world but it doesn\\u2019t mean it is impossible! You just need to find the right motivation to get started and keep going.\nA lot of people give up on their New Year\\u2019s resolutions before they even begin, because they don\\u2019t have a plan of action and fail to consider what will keep them motivated along the way.

The parties to the dispute agree to meet with the mediator and disclose facts, but not argue their case. Instead, the goal is for both sides to listen carefully to what the other has to say and explore possible compromises that are agreeable to both.\nMediation can be used at any stage of a dispute, from resolving initial grievances through settlement or arbitration. It can be used instead of litigation when there\\u2019s no clear right or wrong side or when it\\u2019s more cost-effective than adversarial proceedings. Research shows mediation can also make disputes last much shorter and cheaper than trials, reduce risk of lawsuits being refilled after settlement, and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in principle between parties.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response.
