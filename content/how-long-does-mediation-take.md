intro: >-
  Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution procedure that helps two
  parties find common ground and reach a mutually beneficial outcome. It is not
  a trial, nor does it involve judging or advocacy. Rather, mediation is a
  collaborative process where both sides work with neutral third-party mediators
  to resolve their dispute and come to an agreement that’s fair and equitable
  for all involved.

  Mediation can take as long as each party needs it to take and no longer than that. Depending on the case, mediation sessions can last anywhere from one hour to multiple days. The time frame will depend largely on multiple factors including:

  Mediation sessions are confidential, so there isn’t a set end time like you might experience in court or arbitration proceedings. Instead, parties can chose to end mediation at any point if they feel they’ve reached the best possible outcome for themselves and the other party involved. Here are some general guidelines regarding how long mediation takes:

## Mediation for simple cases

If the case is very simple and only involves an issue for one party—and one party only—then mediation will be a quick and easy process. The goal of mediation is to help all parties find a mutually beneficial solution that works for everyone, so in simple cases the mediator will help the parties brainstorm, negotiate, and collaborate towards the best possible solution.
This can be done in a single session or over the course of several sessions—it depends on the complexity of the case, the personalities in the room, and the mediator’s style.

## Mediation for complex cases

At the same time, mediation can also be a very useful tool for more complex cases where multiple parties are involved. Mediation can be useful where there are multiple parties, a lot of money on the line, and/or complex issues of law and fact that need to be worked out. Complex cases can often get stuck in court, but mediation provides an alternative path towards resolution that avoids the expense and time of a drawn-out trial.
In complex cases, mediation is often a multi-session process. The mediator will help the parties work towards a solution that works for everyone, but it may take more than one session to get there.
For example, mediation for a contentious divorce could take several sessions over the course of several months with attorneys and accountants present. The parties may want to manage their finances jointly for a period of time, which can be accomplished through a collaborative divorce process.

## Mediation with expert witnesses

In cases where there are expert witnesses involved, mediation may take longer because an expert must be brought in and given time to review the facts of the case and provide a report or testimony.
Once the mediator has everything they need from the expert, they can then work with the parties to find a solution. But because experts typically have very busy schedules, mediation with an expert witness may take longer than normal.

## Mediation for cross-border disputes

When a case has international elements, the process of mediation may take longer. International cases inherently require more time because of the number of parties involved.
At the same time, mediation is a flexible process that can accommodate the unique needs of cross-border disputes. The mediator can help set up conference calls and find ways to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible given the complexities of international cases.

## Key takeaway

Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution procedure that helps two parties find common ground and reach a mutually beneficial outcome. Cases with multiple parties, a lot of money on the line, or complex issues of law and fact may take longer to resolve compared to simpler cases.

## Conclusion

Mediation is a flexible and collaborative process that can take as long as each party needs it to take and no longer than that. Depending on the case, mediation can last anywhere from one hour to multiple days. The time frame will depend largely on multiple factors including the complexity of the case, the personalities in the room, and the mediator’s style.

Now that you understand how mediation works, you can make an informed decision about which dispute resolution method might be best for your situation. Whether you’re in a commercial dispute, a divorce, or any type of scenario where two parties need to come to an agreement, mediation can be a helpful and effective tool.
