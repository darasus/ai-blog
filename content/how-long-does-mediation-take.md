Mediation is a process that can help resolve disputes between two or more parties. It is a voluntary process that is confidential and informal. Mediation can be used to resolve disputes in a wide variety of areas, including but not limited to: family, business, employment, landlord-tenant, and small claims. The mediator is a neutral third party who helps the parties communicate and reach a resolution. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties or tell the parties what to do.

The length of mediation depends on a number of factors, including the number of parties, the complexity of the issues, the willingness of the parties to cooperate, and the schedule of the mediator. Generally, mediation sessions last two to three hours. The number of sessions required also varies, depending on the factors mentioned above. In some cases, one session is sufficient to reach a resolution. In other cases, multiple sessions may be necessary.

If you are considering mediation to resolve a dispute, it is important to consult with an experienced mediator to discuss your specific situation and to determine whether mediation is right for you.
