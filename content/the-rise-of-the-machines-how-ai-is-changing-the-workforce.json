  "title": "The rise of the machines: how AI is changing the workforce",
  "summary": "The development of AI is likely to change all aspects of life, including the labour market and the way people earn their living. AI is expected to affect all industries, occupations, and regions to varying degrees. In some cases, it will lead to a net increase in jobs, while in others, it may result in a net decrease in employment in some fields. Good jobs will require more expertise in order to keep their jobs. Some low-wage workers do jobs that require a lot of skill and training. As a result, they are not as likely to be replaced by AI.",
  "intro": "Today’s workforce is undergoing a transformation unlike any in the past century. This transformation is the result of recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI is already impacting how businesses operate, how products are designed and manufactured, and how customers interact with organizations. AI has the potential to transform every industry and job role that uses computers. The increased use of AI in everyday life will lead to a change in what jobs are available, what they pay, and where they can be found. The rise of the machines will affect different people in different ways – some positively and other negatively. Keep reading to learn more about how AI is changing the workforce and what you can do to stay ahead of the curve.",
  "content": "## What is artificial intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence is the ability of machines to make good decisions. AI involves teaching machines to think like humans. It’s a broad term that describes many types of technology that are designed to imitate human behaviour. These technologies are used to solve problems that would take a lot of human effort, like making judgements about credit risk, or understanding language. It is a type of machine learning. AI has been around for decades, but recent advances in computing power have made it more realistic.\n\nThere are two different types of AI: general and narrow. General AI is the sci-fi idea of a machine that can do everything that a human can. That’s still a long way off, but narrow AI is already being used in our daily lives. Narrow AI is what you see in apps like Siri and Alexa – it’s designed to do one thing really well. Some examples of AI include speech recognition, machine learning, and robotics. The development of AI is likely to change all aspects of life, including the labour market and the way people earn their living.\n\n## How is AI changing the workforce?\n\nAI is expected to affect all industries, occupations, and regions to varying degrees. In some cases, it will lead to a net increase in jobs, while in others, it may result in a net decrease. There are two key ways in which AI will impact the labour market:\n\n- Jobs that can be automated will be automated - Certain jobs will be automated as the technology improves. This will lead to a net decrease in employment in those fields.\n- Certain jobs will become more valuable - Some jobs will become more valuable as new opportunities are created. This will lead to a net increase in employment in those fields.\nAs AI technologies improve, they will affect more occupations and industries. The workers who will be affected are those in fields that are easily automated, such as service and sales. This is because these jobs consist of tasks that can be automated with current AI technology.\n\n## Good jobs will require more expertise\n\nAs AI becomes more widespread, workers will have to become increasingly knowledgeable about AI in order to keep their jobs. This is because AI is often used to automate tasks. For example, if you work in sales and are responsible for making bids, an AI system may be able to take over this task. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It may free up your time to do other things that are more valuable to your company. Experts who understand AI can also help develop better AI technology.\nThere will also be new jobs created as a result of AI technologies. These may include jobs in areas like programming, design, and consulting. While some experts are worried about their jobs becoming obsolete, others are confident that their expertise will keep them in work.\n\n## Bad jobs will require more skills\n\nSome low-wage jobs involve tasks that are easily automated. As a result, workers in those jobs will probably be displaced by AI.\nSome low-wage workers do jobs that require a lot of skill and training. As a result, they are not as likely to be replaced by AI. This is especially true for jobs that require social skills that AI is not designed to do, such as nursing or management.\nFor example, a cashier at a grocery store who scans items that people purchase is a job that is easily automated. On the other hand, a professor who researches and teaches is a job that is not easily automated.\nWhether your job is more likely to be automated depends on your job duties. If your job is administrative or routine, such as bookkeeping, you are more likely to be replaced by AI. If your job requires a lot of creativity, new ideas, or social skills, you are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\n## Jobs will be lost, but also gained\n\nAs AI technologies become more widely used, some jobs will become unnecessary. People who do those jobs will probably be out of work as those jobs are automated. These jobs will be lost because they are not done by AI systems. Other jobs, however, will be created as a result of AI.\nThis will lead to a net decrease in employment in some fields. And it will lead to a net increase in employment in other fields.\nThese two effects will probably roughly cancel each other out in the end. It is unclear exactly how many jobs will be lost, how many will be gained, and how long it will take.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rise of the machines is here and has the potential to disrupt society in a lot of ways. While it’s not entirely certain how society will change as a result of AI, it’s clear that there will be significant implications for the workforce. AI has the potential to create new types of jobs and eliminate others. It may also change the way people work and learn."
