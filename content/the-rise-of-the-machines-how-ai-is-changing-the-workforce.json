This is because AI is often used to automate tasks. For example, if you work in sales and are responsible for making bids, an AI system may be able to take over this task. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It may free up your time to do other things that are more valuable to your company. Experts who understand AI can also help develop better AI technology.\nThere will also be new jobs created as a result of AI technologies.

As a result, workers in those jobs will probably be displaced by AI.\nSome low-wage workers do jobs that require a lot of skill and training. As a result, they are not as likely to be replaced by AI. This is especially true for jobs that require social skills that AI is not designed to do, such as nursing or management.\nFor example, a cashier at a grocery store who scans items that people purchase is a job that is easily automated. On the other hand, a professor who researches and teaches is a job that is not easily automated.\nWhether your job is more likely to be automated depends on your job duties. If your job is administrative or routine, such as bookkeeping, you are more likely to be replaced by AI. If your job requires a lot of creativity, new ideas, or social skills, you are less likely to be replaced by AI.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Jobs will be lost, but also gained\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`As AI technologies become more widely used, some jobs will become unnecessary.

Other jobs, however, will be created as a result of AI.\nThis will lead to a net decrease in employment in some fields.
