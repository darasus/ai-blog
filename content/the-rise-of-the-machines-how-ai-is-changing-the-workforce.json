This is not necessarily a bad thing. It may free up your time to do other things that are more valuable to your company. Experts who understand AI can also help develop better AI technology.\nThere will also be new jobs created as a result of AI technologies.

On the other hand, a professor who researches and teaches is a job that is not easily automated.\nWhether your job is more likely to be automated depends on your job duties.
