This is not necessarily a bad thing. It may free up your time to do other things that are more valuable to your company. Experts who understand AI can also help develop better AI technology.\nThere will also be new jobs created as a result of AI technologies.

On the other hand, a professor who researches and teaches is a job that is not easily automated.\nWhether your job is more likely to be automated depends on your job duties.

In that period there was a famous video game crash where Atari and other gaming companies made losses due to overproduction and in response many gamers stopped buying video games for almost four years. This led to Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs\\u2019 friend) proposing that they start their own computer company \\u2013 which became known as Apple Computer Inc.\nWhat follows is a detailed look into the history of Apple Inc., including details about key executives and any relevant organizational changes.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
