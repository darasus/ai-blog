The number of subgenres and variations within the larger genres is innumerable. It\\u2019s also an industry that has recently come under fire for its lack of diversity and representation in regards to gender, sexuality, religion, race, and so much more. As a result of these issues becoming more apparent and publicized, artists have been producing music with a purpose; focusing on important topics and causes through their music.\nIf you spend any time listening to rap or hip-hop music, you\\u2019ve probably noticed how many songs are about money, sex, drugs, partying\\u2014basically all the things you can do when you\\u2019re rich and famous. But there are some rappers who are using their fame to make a difference in the world by speaking out about problems that need to be addressed: social injustice, poverty, drug abuse, child exploitation and other serious issues. These artists are making a conscious effort to use their music to make a positive impact on society rather than just focusing on things like materialism or promiscuity.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There are no heroes in this period\\u2014just two paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a stark world where there are no easy answers.\nThe 1980s was a peak moment in that tension\\u2014from Reagan\\u2019s \\u201Cevil empire\\u201D speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe. In brief: It was not a good time to be alive if you believed in world peace. Thankfully, Hollywood had spies as intrepid as Tom Hanks ready to leap into action against those dastardly Soviet Commies whenever they needed someone captured or rescued from behind enemy lines.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, it goes deeper than just putting electric guitars aside; these songs are stripped right down to the bare bones. There\\u2019s still plenty of production value\\u2014especially on the third track\\u2014but it feels like Puth made a conscious decision not to hide behind anything.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
