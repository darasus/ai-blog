This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light.
