summary: Python is designed so that you don’t have to think about the rules and
  syntax of the language as you write your code. Python’s open-source nature
  made the language completely free to use. Python is currently the second most
  popular programming language (after the ever-present JavaScript), with a vast
  community of developers, tools, tutorials, and resources. Python offers a wide
  range of data types, including strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries.
  Python also offers a whole host of services, including the ability to use
  various programming paradigms, and the ability. to use modules and packages.
intro: >-
  A programming language is only as good as the people who use it. It’s not
  enough for a programming language to be perfect, complete and universal; if no
  one uses it, it’s useless. That’s why the design of any new programming
  language involves a lot of user research. The creators of Python — an
  open-source general-purpose programming language first released in 1991 —
  recognized from the start that if they were going to succeed, they needed to
  create a language that was accessible and appealing to a wide audience. And
  so, despite its many advanced features, Python remains transparent and
  straightforward, with syntax that directly addresses the needs and abilities
  of most programmers. 

  Read on to learn more about this brilliant programming syntax and why you should take some time to get acquainted with Python today!

## Interactive Programming and Scripting

The two basic modes of programming in Python are interactive programming and scripting. As an interactive language, Python is useful for running one or a few lines of code as a test. Interactive code might be used to test out a particular procedure, or to try out a new technique that you’re trying to learn. Python can also be used for scripting — running a series of code in a desired order. You might use scripting if you want to automate a task that you run frequently, or to create a program for a computer that doesn’t have an equivalent in Python. For example, you might write a script to send regular emails, or to access and alter data on a website.

## Simple By Design

Simple, elegant and accessible. These are the sorts of adjectives we use to describe the best tools and languages that we use daily. Python’s syntax is unobtrusive and helpful, making it a joy to use. Unlike many other programming languages, you don’t have to memorize a thousand rules in order to understand and create code in Python. In fact, Python is designed so that you don’t even have to think about the rules and syntax of the language as you write your code. Instead, Python’s syntax is so straightforward that it feels like you’re simply writing words. Python’s open-source nature made the language completely free to use and, as such, it’s a good choice to learn as a beginner. Simply put, you can’t go wrong with Python and there isn’t much to go wrong in the first place!

## Easy to Read and Write

Besides being straightforward, Python’s syntax is also extremely readable, making it a pleasure to read and write code. For example, when you have to create a conditional statement that checks for a certain condition, then executes a certain block of code if the condition is true, Python’s syntax makes it easy to understand what’s happening. In Python, you can simply write the following code: if condition:
While many other programming languages would require you to write that same code like this: if condition then
end if
Loops are similarly simple and straightforward in Python. To create a for loop that runs five times, you simply write the following code: for i in range(5):
For many programming languages, this same code would require you to write it like this: for i = 0; i  5; i++
end
Loops and conditionals in Python are clear and understandable, while many other programming languages require an unnecessary amount of effort to both read and write.

## Built-in Data Types and Services

One of the most important aspects of any programming language is the data types it offers and the services it provides. If a language doesn’t offer the features and services you need, you’ll never use it. Fortunately, Python offers a wide range of data types, including strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries. Python also offers a whole host of services, including the ability to read and write from various data sources, the ability to use various programming paradigms, and the ability to use modules and packages.

While not every language has to offer the same services and data types, the fact that Python does is a huge plus for the language. If you want to create a piece of software or a website, you need to know what data types and services your programming language offers so that you can use them effectively.

## Python Is Widely Used

As we’ve seen, Python is a simple, straightforward, and readable programming language that offers a wide range of features. However, there is one more thing that makes Python so appealing: it’s one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Python is currently the second most popular programming language (after the ever-present JavaScript), with a vast community of developers, tools, tutorials, and resources.

If you ever run into a problem while learning or using Python, rest assured that you’re not alone — there’s a good chance that someone else has already been there, done that, and left a solution behind. Python has been around for a long time, and there are plenty of examples of how to use Python for all kinds of tasks. You can also use Python for websites and data analysis, making it a very versatile programming language indeed.

## Conclusion

Python is a simple, straightforward, and readable programming language designed for a wide audience. Despite its many advanced features, Python remains transparent and straightforward, with syntax that directly addresses the needs and abilities of most programmers.

If you’re looking for a programming language that is accessible, simple, and easy to understand, then Python is the perfect choice for you.
