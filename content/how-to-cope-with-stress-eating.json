While there are many different benefits to exercise, the biggest thing that it has to offer is stress reduction.

Many of us make the common resolution to exercise more. However, that can be easier said than done for some people. If you don\\u2019t feel like working out one day, it doesn\\u2019t mean you stop going to the gym or just give up entirely. It means you have to come up with creative ways to stay motivated and get moving when you don\\u2019t feel like it.\nExercising is not always fun, but we need it to remain healthy and fit. While some people love sweating in their favorite gym class, others avoid workouts because they know how much they hate them. While exercise can be difficult at times, there are lots of different ways you can make moving more fun so that it becomes second nature and something you no longer dread.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
