summary: Many people assume that leftovers are unhealthy, but that’s not the
  case if you make smart choices. Rotating your vegetables will help you avoid
  falling into a pattern where you’re only eating one or two types of vegetables
  every week. Eating smaller meals throughout the day has been shown to increase
  feelings of fullness and prevent overeating at meals. Eating beans and Lentils
  are two of the healthiest protein sources you can eat, and you can use them to
  replace meat in tacos and burritos.
intro: >-
  It’s not always easy to find time to sit down and eat healthy meals. In
  fact, most adults spend about a third of their weeknight time on food and
  drink, which leaves little time for anything else. 

  We all lead busy lives with lots of obligations outside of work or school: we have friends, family members, and partners that we need to spend time with on a regular basis. It doesn’t leave much room for eating right.

  Fortunately, there are lots of ways to keep your diet in check while also fitting in your hectic schedule. Keeping healthy snacks like fruits and nuts stocked at home can help you avoid getting hungry at the worst possible moment. Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day is another great approach that can help you feel fuller faster without overloading your system with calories at one sitting. Eating well when you’re busy isn’t impossible; it just takes some planning ahead.

## Plan Your Meals Ahead of Time

One of the biggest ways to make sure that you’re eating right is to plan your meals ahead of time. It’s easier to make healthy choices when you know what’s coming up instead of reacting to whatever happens to be in the fridge. It’s also helpful to decide what you’re going to eat before you enter the kitchen. Sometimes the mere act of opening the fridge can make it harder to stick to your healthy eating plan.
Most people make healthy meal plans on paper, but you can also use an online diet app like MyFitnessPal to streamline the process.

## Don’t Fear Leftovers

Many people assume that leftovers are unhealthy, but that’s not the case if you make smart choices. Many foods can actually taste even better when they’re reheated, which is helpful if you don’t have the time or energy to cook a brand new meal.

If you’re eating leftover veggies, be sure to reheat them long enough to kill any bacteria that might have grown while the food was sitting in the fridge. Foods like pasta, rice, and potatoes can all be re-heated in a microwave, but other items may require a stovetop re-heat.

Many experts recommend eating leftover foods as a way to lower the cost of your diet, but be sure to make healthy choices when you’re re-heating. Avoid things like fried foods, fatty sauces, and heavy gravies that weren’t healthy to begin with.

## Rotate Your Veggies

Not all vegetables are created equally. While some are high in fiber and low in calories, others are heavy and rich in calories. It’s not uncommon to see people falling into a rut where they eat the same vegetables every week. That’s fine if you’re eating healthy options, but it’s very easy to gradually slip into a pattern where you’re only eating root vegetables. Root vegetables are important, but they shouldn’t be the only vegetables in your diet.
For example, you might want to include peppers in your diet once a week. Or, if you enjoy cabbages, you could make a point of eating it at least a couple times a month. Rotating your vegetables will help you avoid getting bored with your meals. It’ll also help you avoid falling into a pattern where you’re only eating one or two types of vegetables.

## Go For High-Fiber Vegetables

Fiber is important for healthy digestion and blood sugar balance, but some vegetables have much more of it than others. In fact, some veggies have no fiber at all, so it’s important to choose wisely.
Vegetables like kale and broccoli are great sources of fiber, but you’ll find fewer of these nutrients in lettuce and avocado. It’s best to focus on eating plenty of veggies like kale and collard greens, as well as whole grains like oats and barley.
Vegetables and grains are two of the easiest ways to boost your daily fiber intake. It’s also helpful to avoid eating too many whole grains, as they can be rich in calories.

## Try Beans and Lentils

Some people avoid eating beans and legumes because they aren’t sure how to prepare them. But they happen to be two of the healthiest foods you can eat. In fact, beans have been shown to have just as many health benefits as other protein sources.
You can try eating beans in a variety of different ways, including eating them in bean burritos, salads, and in chili. Lentils are another high-protein food that can be used in a number of different dishes. You can try them in soups or stews, or you can use them to replace meat in tacos and burritos.

## Keep Healthy Snacks Handy

Keep a variety of healthy snacks handy so that you can avoid overeating at meals. It’s important to eat throughout the day, but it’s also easy to overeat when you’re eating more meals.
For example, if you eat three meals a day and each meal includes a baked potato, you’ll be getting far more carbs than you need in one day. It’s important to avoid that by keeping healthy snacks nearby so that you can eat just enough to avoid feeling hungry.
You can also try eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. Eating more often has been shown to increase feelings of fullness and prevent overeating at one sitting.

## Don’t Be Afraid Of The Fridge

Some people are under the impression that eating vegetables out of the fridge is bad for you. While it’s true that vegetables lose some of their nutritional value when they’re kept in the fridge, they’re still very healthy.
You can help keep vegetables fresh by cutting them up and placing them in a plastic container with a lid. You can also buy vegetables that have been pre-cut, which makes it easier to use them in a meal.
It’s important to remember that eating fresh food is always better than eating something that’s been sitting in your fridge for a long time.

## Try A Smaller Plate

Eating off a smaller plate is one way to trick yourself into eating less food. It’s an old trick, but it works: Studies have found that people tend to eat less when they eat off smaller plates.
If you don’t want to buy a new set of dishes, you can still eat off a smaller plate. Just put a folded cloth or paper towel in the center of your plate. It should be about one-third the size of your normal plate. This extra space will help you eat less without really noticing the difference.

## Bottom line

Now that you know how to eat healthy on the go, there’s no excuse to fall short on your diet. Nobody has the time to spend hours in the kitchen cooking elaborate meals, but it’s not hard to grab a quick snack or salad while you’re out and about.

We all lead busy lives with lots of obligations outside of work or school: we have friends, family members, and partners that we need to spend time with on a regular basis. It doesn’t leave much room for eating right. Fortunately, there are lots of ways to keep your diet in check while also fitting in your hectic schedule.
