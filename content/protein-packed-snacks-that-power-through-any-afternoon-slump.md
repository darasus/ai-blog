## What is an afternoon slump and why do we get them?

Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep. It is naturally produced in our brains when it gets dark outside, signaling for us to start winding down for the day. This hormone is also what causes us to feel tired and sleepy. During the day, melatonin is produced in the pineal gland in our brains. The pineal gland is responsible for regulating sleeping patterns and other hormones, including serotonin.

We typically have high levels of serotonin throughout the day as it is responsible for regulating mood and appetite. As the sun starts to set, serotonin levels drop and melatonin begins to rise. This is what causes us to feel sleepy and crave foods high in carbohydrates, namely sugary or starchy foods.

When it is dark outside and the sun isn’t providing us with the energy we need to stay active, serotonin levels are low, causing many of us to feel sluggish. If you find yourself craving sweets throughout the day or feeling lethargic, serotonin levels may be to blame. The best way to combat an afternoon slump is to eat foods that are high in tryptophan and protein.

## The importance of protein

Eating high-protein snacks can help to regulate serotonin levels, keeping your mood up and curbing cravings for starchy or sugary foods. The more protein you consume, the fuller you will feel, reducing the urge to snack on foods that are high in sugar.

Not only does protein help to regulate serotonin, but it also boosts energy levels naturally. Proteins are the building blocks of muscles and many of our body’s internal organs. Eating protein-rich foods has many health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and regulating metabolism.

Boosting your protein intake is crucial if you are looking to lose weight, maintain a healthy weight or build muscle. While carbohydrates provide us with energy, they don’t offer much when it comes to keeping us full. Protein, on the other hand, takes longer to digest, keeping you feeling full for longer and helping to regulate serotonin levels.
