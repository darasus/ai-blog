When it comes to snacks that will help power through an afternoon slump, there are few options better than those that are packed with protein. Not only will protein help to keep you feeling fuller for longer, but it will also give your body the energy it needs to make it through the rest of the day.

Some great protein-packed snacks that are perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up include:

1. Greek yogurt with berries and granola: This snack is packed with protein from the yogurt, as well as healthy carbohydrates from the berries and granola. The combination will give you sustained energy and help to keep your hunger at bay.

2. Peanut butter and jelly sandwich: A classic for a reason, this sandwich provides both protein and carbohydrates, making it a perfect snack for an afternoon slump. Just be sure to choose a whole grain bread and use natural peanut butter to keep it healthy.

3. Trail mix: This snack is perfect for when you’re on the go and need something to tide you over until your next meal. Make your own mix with a variety of nuts, seeds, and dried fruit for a snack that’s both delicious and nutritious.

4. Hard-boiled eggs: A great source of protein, hard-boiled eggs make for a quick and easy snack that will help keep you feeling full until dinner. Add a little salt and pepper for extra flavor, or pair them with a piece of fruit for a complete snack.

5. Vegetables and dip: This may seem like a strange choice for a snack, but vegetables are actually a great source of protein. Pair them with a healthy dip like hummus or guacamole for a satisfying and nutritious snack that will help power through an afternoon slump.
