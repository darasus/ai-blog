intro: >-
  Making a pot of soup is one of the easiest home-cooked meals to make. You
  put some ingredients in a pot, bring it to a boil, and whirl it around for a
  while. There’s not much more to it than that. 

  Making great soup, however, is another story. The best soups have layers of flavor that explode in your mouth. They aren’t thin and watery, nor are they so packed with dense ingredients that you can barely get your spoon into the bowl without fishing out half a carrot first.

  If you’ve only ever made soup as an afterthought—something to keep in the pantry when you don’t feel like eating leftovers—it might be time to give it another look. Making great soup isn’t difficult once you know how. Here are 5 easy tips for making better soup:

## Use quality ingredients

There are hundreds of recipes for every type of soup imaginable, but at the end of the day, the most important thing in any soup is the ingredients. If you start with low quality (or even just average quality) ingredients, your soup will taste like it came out of a can.
If you want to taste the freshness of your ingredients, you have to start with freshness. If you want your soup to be creamy without adding heavy cream, it’s essential that you use top quality butter. If you want your broth to be rich and deeply flavored, it needs to taste of chicken, not just water.

## Always simmer your soup

If you want to make a delicious, rich soup, don’t bring it to a boil, bring it to a simmer. A boil is vigorous and chaotic, whereas a simmer is slow and controlled.
A boil will cause your vegetables to break down and your broth to boil away into nothingness. A simmer, on the other hand, will slowly infuse your ingredients with flavor.
If your soup is too thin, the best way to fix it is to reduce it on the stovetop for 10-15 minutes—not to boil it harder.

## Slurp while you’re simmering

Not only is it polite to slurp your noodles when eating in Japan, it’s essential to creating delicious soup.
If you don’t taste your soup as you’re making it, you’re missing out on a huge part of the process. Taste your ingredients as they cook and adjust them to your liking.
Let your taste buds help you create a soup that is perfectly seasoned and incredibly delicious.

## Add your aromatics at the beginning

Not all aromatics need to go in at the beginning, but most of them do. If you add onion and garlic at the end, they’ll lose their flavor.
If you want your soup to be rich and flavorful, add your aromatics to the pot from the very beginning.
By letting them simmer for the entire time your soup cooks, they’ll release tons of essential oils that will flavor your broth.

## Don’t forget the garnishes!

Fresh herbs, croutons, grated cheese, and freshly ground pepper are just a few of the dozens of garnishes that make great soup even better.
If your soup is creamy and rich, a few fresh herbs will add a bright freshness.
If your soup is rich and hearty, a bit of brightness is just what it needs.
If your soup is rich and creamy, a bit of crunchy texture is just what it needs.

## Conclusion

Soup is the ultimate comfort food. It’s warm and nourishing, and it can be both hearty and light at the same time. It can be packed with lots of different ingredients or just one special ingredient, and it can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.
If you want to make delicious, satisfying soup, these 5 easy tips are an excellent place to start!
