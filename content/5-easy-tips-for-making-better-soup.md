## What is great content?

There are plenty of articles that are shared on social media every day. And there are plenty of articles that get clicked on every day. But there are very few articles that can genuinely be called great.

So, what makes a piece of content truly great? Well, it has to grab your readers’ attention by standing out from everything else they have to wade through on a daily basis. And it has to actually inform them in some way that they’ll find useful. Finally, it has to be unique enough to not just be a regurgitation of what’s already out there.
So, what do all of these things have to do with creating great content for your restaurant? Well, when you’re trying to market your restaurant, you want to create content that looks and feels like it’s something that’s published by a major news outlet. Because that’s exactly what your potential customers are looking for.

## Make it useful

The most important thing when creating content is making sure it’s actually useful. This isn’t a time to put your marketing team on display and show off how creative you are. Instead, it’s a time to put your customer service team on display and show off how useful you can be. You want your content to give some kind of useful information to your readers. This can be anything from recipes to trick for creating the perfect soup to how to find the best parking in your area.
So, what makes content truly useful for your customers?
There has to be a clear benefit to reading it. Whatever information you’re providing has to be something that your readers will want and be able to use in their lives.
You have to address an actual need or problem your readers are having. If you can’t do this, it’s not useful.
You have to be able to provide a solution to the problem or need your readers have. If you can’t do this, it’s not useful.

## Write about your food

One of the most important parts of your restaurant is your food. It’s what you came up with and created to differentiate yourself from other restaurants. It’s what’s on your menu and what your chefs have carefully crafted in their kitchens. So, why not write about it?
You can write about the ingredients you use, how your food is prepared and how you source everything to make sure it’s the highest quality and freshest it can be. You can write about the different types of customers you have and the experience they can expect when they come to your restaurant. And you can write about how you select your menu items and what makes each one special.

## Write about the experience

Many of your customers likely come to your restaurant because they want a certain type of experience. They want to feel like they’re sitting at a gourmet table in a fancy restaurant. They want to feel like they’re sitting at the neighborhood diner, sharing a meal with friends. They want to feel like they’re being served by a family-owned and operated business. And they want to feel like they’re being served by employees who they know and trust. You can write about the experience your customers can expect to have when they come to your restaurant. You can write about the type of service your servers provide and the reasons behind it. You can write about the way your restaurant looks and how it makes customers feel. You can write about how your tables are set up and why you do it that way.

## Write about your restaurant’s culture

There’s something about going out to eat. And it’s not just the food. It’s the feeling you get when you walk into a restaurant. It’s the decor, the sounds, and the people you see who work there. It’s the way the people who work there treat you and make you feel. It’s the way they make you feel like they genuinely care about you. It’s being able to have a conversation with your friends without being too loud.
You can write about all of these things. You can write about what makes your restaurant unique among other restaurants in your area. You can write about how you make your customers feel like they’re welcome in your restaurant. You can write about how you want your customers to feel when they walk out of your restaurant and go back home. You can write about the way you interact with customers and how you make them feel like you truly appreciate their business.

## Write about the food you serve

One of the most important parts of any restaurant is its menu. It’s what your chefs create and craft. It’s what your customers look at when they visit your restaurant and what they decide what to order. So, why not write about it?
You can write about the different types of menu items you have. You can write about what inspires your menu items and the people who helped create them. You can write about how often your menu changes and why you do it. You can write about the history of your menu items and the people who helped create them.
You can write about the reason behind each menu item and how it’s different from every other item on the menu. You can write about how your menu items are prepared and sourced. You can write about the people who work in the kitchen and what inspires them to create the amazing food they do.
