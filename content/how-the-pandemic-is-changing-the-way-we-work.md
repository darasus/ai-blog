intro: >-
  Time is money, as the saying goes. And when you’re grappling with
  pandemic disease and a global outbreak, time spent at work has a whole
  different set of implications.

  Pandemic flu strains have decimated human populations since the first recorded pandemic in 541 AD. Over the centuries, outbreaks have been frequent enough to instill fear in even the most stoic among us. 

  Today we face another pandemic threat with the potential to be even more devastating than those which came before it. A highly virulent strain of influenza A virus known as influenza pandemia has begun spreading rapidly throughout much of the world. 

  In many ways, today’s workplace is very different from that of a century ago. Technology has advanced; office structures are more open and collaborative; and workers are expected to demonstrate self-motivation and flexibility in order to thrive in an ever-changing workplace environment.

## The Value of Time

As a commodity, time is something we all have in equal measure. Yet one’s value of that time can vary greatly depending on the individual. Understanding how your employees value time at work can help you cultivate a culture that supports high performance and productivity without conforming to a one-size-fits-all model.

Analyzing your employees’ time-related attitudes and behaviors can help you identify areas for improvement. If you notice employees feeling frustrated with their ability to balance work and life responsibilities, for example, you may want to consider changes that allow for increased flexibility.

## Working Remotely

When an office is quarantined, or a pandemic forces employees to take a leave of absence, virtual offices become an increasingly attractive option — especially for companies that rely heavily on remote workers.
Not only does a virtual office allow for continuity of work, it also decreases the risk of employees bringing a virus home to their families.
Remote workers have the option of working from home, or they could choose a coworking space where they can meet other virtual employees face-to-face.
If you have a virtual office, you’ll want to make sure your employees are equipped with everything they need to do their jobs effectively. That may include access to company documents, collaboration tools, and a virtual private network, or VPN, to enable secure remote access to company systems and data.

## Collaboration, Culture, and Wellness

Collaboration, culture, and wellness are all critical components of effective pandemic preparedness. Working together to solve problems and share knowledge, for example, can help your team avoid mistakes and quickly identify areas for improvement.
Connecting with your employees on a personal level can help you foster a culture rooted in mutual trust and respect. Trust is critical when handling work with sensitive or confidential information — especially during a pandemic, when you’ll need to be especially mindful of data security.
For many people, pandemic flu can be a very real health concern. While you can’t completely eliminate the risk of infection for your employees, you can take steps to help them stay healthy by encouraging healthy habits and lifestyles.

## Flexibility and Employee Rewards

Depending on the pandemic’s severity, you may find that employees are reluctant to take leave. In such situations, you may need to offer them a choice between paid sick leave and a more flexible work arrangement.
Employees who feel they’re being asked to work when they’re not 100% healthy are more likely to infect others. That’s why it’s so important to enforce strict sick leave policies.
When your pandemic flu crisis comes to an end, you may find that some employees are reluctant to return to work, even if they’re feeling healthy again. In these situations, you’ll want to explore creative options for rewarding employees for their flexibility during the crisis.

## Company-Wide Pandemic Preparedness Strategies

Company-wide pandemic preparedness strategies are critical for protecting your business during a pandemic outbreak. You’ll want to develop a communication strategy that clearly outlines your pandemic preparedness procedures for employees and customers alike.
Depending on the severity of the pandemic, you may need to close your business temporarily or implement a virtual shutdown. In these situations, you’ll also want to consider developing a contingency plan to protect your company against pandemic litigation.

## Final Thoughts

When it comes to pandemic flu, it’s important to stay informed and take the necessary precautions. Seek out medical advice to determine if you should be vaccinated against the virus, and be sure to wear a respirator mask if you are in a high-risk situation.
Keep in mind that while pandemic flu should be taken seriously, it’s not a death sentence. With proper preparation and a few healthy habits, you can avoid contracting the virus and stay healthy through even the worst pandemic outbreaks.
