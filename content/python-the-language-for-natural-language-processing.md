Python is a versatile language that you can use for building all sorts of applications. But one area where Python really shines is natural language processing.

Natural language processing is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It helps computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language.

Python is a great language for natural language processing because it is easy to read and write. It has a large and active community. And it has many libraries and tools for NLP tasks.

In this article, you will learn about some of the most popular Python libraries and tools for natural language processing.

1. NLTK

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

2. spaCy

spaCy is a library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python. It was designed specifically for production use, and it excels at large-scale text classification and tokenization. spaCy comes with pre-trained statistical models and word vectors, and it also supports several languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and more.

3. Gensim

Gensim is a library for topic modeling and document similarity. It can be used to train word embeddings from scratch or load pre-trained word vectors. It also supports several popular similarity measures such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and more.

4. Pattern

Pattern is a web mining module for the Python programming language. It has tools for data mining (Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia API, a web crawler), natural language processing (part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment analysis, WordNet), machine learning (vector space model, clustering, SVM), network analysis (centrality measures, link analysis), and visualization.

5. TextBlob

TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
