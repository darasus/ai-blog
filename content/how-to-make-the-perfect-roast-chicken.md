## What You’ll Need

- Roast Chicken - The star of the show! This is a whole bird – i.e. the entire chicken has been removed from the bone – so you can use it to make multiple meals.
- Lemon - This is used to both flavour and tenderise your chicken. It also breaks down the collagen on the skin so it crisps up in the oven.
- Herbs - These will flavour your chicken as well as make a beautiful garnish for your plate.
- Butter - A smear of butter on your chicken skin will help it crisp up to make the perfect roast chicken. - Salt and Pepper - Use coarse sea salt to really make the most of the flavours.
- Cornflour - This acts as a binding agent for the herbs and butter you will use to coat your chicken.

## The Secret to Making a Perfect Roast Chicken

- The bird should be at room temperature before you start roasting it so it cooks evenly. You can put it in the fridge or on a windowsill to speed up this process.
- While you can use a whole bird, we recommend cutting it up into pieces before roasting. This makes it easier to eat and serve, especially when making a larger portion for a crowd. You can use our handy infographic to guide you.
- You can flavour your chicken in many different ways, but the most important thing to remember is to get the skin crispy. A good way to do this is to baste your chicken with a sauce that contains butter and lemon; the fat in the butter will create a nice crust on the chicken.

## Aromatics

- An aromatic side dish – such as roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes – compliments roasted chicken perfectly.
- The secret to really getting the most out of your roasted vegetables is to add aromatics to the pan: Add things like chopped garlic, onions, fresh herbs or whole spices like cumin and black pepper.
- These will infuse the vegetables and make them taste delicious. You can use these additions with many different dishes – roasted vegetables are great served with almost anything.

## Basting and Marinating

- A great way to flavour your chicken and keep it nice and moist is to marinate it. You can do this with any sauce or marinade – just make sure it has enough time to fully infuse the chicken.
- A great tip is to let the chicken marinate in a bowl that has a lid. This way, you can shake up the bowl to coat the chicken completely with the sauce. If you use a bowl with a handle, you can also keep your hands clean while marinating.
- If you’re after a moist and juicy roast chicken, baste it with a sauce while it’s cooking. You can use any number of sauces you want, but we recommend a mixture of melted butter, lemon and herbs.

## Crispy Skin and Roasted Vegetables

- The skin on a roast chicken is extremely important; it provides not only flavour but also a great texture and appearance.
- Get the skin nice and crispy by first lining a baking tray with parchment paper so that the skin doesn’t stick to the tray. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F, then season the whole chicken generously with coarse sea salt and pepper.
- Put the chicken in the oven for 15 minutes, then remove it and cover the skin with a thin layer of butter. Finally, put it back into the oven for another 30-40 minutes.
- Roasted vegetables are a fantastic side dish for roast chicken. They’re easy to make and look beautiful when served on a plate; make sure to season them generously with salt, pepper and any other herbs you may have on hand.

## Try Something New: Kebab Spiced Chicken Breasts

- If you’re bored of the same old roast chicken, try spicing things up with kebab spiced chicken breasts.
- You can use this marinade to flavour your chicken pieces with a delicious blend of spices.
- Simply combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl or cup, add the chicken pieces and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours before roasting.
