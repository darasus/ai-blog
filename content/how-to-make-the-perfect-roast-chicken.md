## The perfect roast chicken

What more could you ask for than a juicy, flavoursome chicken roasted to perfection?
In order to make the perfect roast chicken, it’s important to start with the right ingredients. Rely on a trusted source of meat that’s free-range and organic if possible. Your roast chicken will taste miles better than the factory-farmed alternative!

When it comes to flavourings and seasonings, roast chicken is very versatile. You can add almost anything to it. Popular options include:

- Herbs: Rosemary and sage make fantastic additions to roast chicken. If you want to try something a little different, try adding some orange zest or a few sprigs of thyme.

- Spices: Chili powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, garam masala, or turmeric can all add a kick of flavour to your roast chicken.

- Garlic: Roasted garlic is delicious, and the flavour will permeate your chicken with a subtle, but delicious aroma.

## Pro tip: dry-brining your chicken

If you have time, consider dry-brining your chicken. This means sprinkling your chicken with salt and letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours before roasting (or at least 30 minutes!). The salt will draw out moisture through osmosis and your chicken will retain more of its natural flavours.

Dry-brining will also help your skin to crisp up during the roasting process, meaning you will have more control over the end result and the amount of fat that drips into your roasting tray.

A simple dry rub will do the trick. You can use one you’ve concocted yourself or purchase a pre-made dry rub from your local grocery store.

## Aromatics and herbs

Aromatics and herbs are what will give your roast chicken its distinct flavour.
Use a combination of fresh herbs and dried herbs if you enjoy the flavour they impart better.

Fresh herbs, like thyme, rosemary, and sage, will retain their flavour and taste better when you roast your chicken than dried herbs, so choose fresh if you can.

Dried herbs, on the other hand, are a great way to add flavour without having to chop up any fresh herbs. If you’re using dried herbs, be sure to use half as much as you would fresh herbs.

If you want to get really fancy, certain vegetables and aromatics can be roasted with your chicken for a delicious and nutritious side dish that goes perfectly with chicken. Try this recipe for roasted root vegetables for a simple and tasty side dish.

## The Chicken Broth

A good chicken broth is a fantastic addition to a roast chicken. If you have time, you can make your own chicken broth and save it in the freezer for future use. Alternatively, you can use a store-bought organic chicken broth, like this organic chicken broth that you can purchase online.

You can use the broth while your chicken is roasting, or you can reserve some of it to use as a sauce after your chicken is fully cooked.

## Timing is everything: roasting times for chicken

When it comes to roast chicken, timing is everything. You want to get your chicken in the oven quickly, but not too quickly or it will burn.
Combining heat and time is how we achieve the perfect roast chicken.

- Heat: You want to put your chicken in a hot oven, but not too hot. You want to preheat your oven to around 400 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are using a gas oven, put the chicken in the oven for a minute before you turn it on to let it warm up. If you are using an electric oven, you want to put the chicken in before it has fully heated up.

- Time: The key here is to not overcook your chicken. You want to cook it until it is fully cooked. The standard cooking time for a roast chicken is 20 to 25 minutes. If you are cooking a larger chicken, increase the time by 5 minutes.

## Flavour balance with herbs and spices

While chicken can take on many different flavours, such as herbs and spices, it also has its own natural flavour that isn’t always present in other meats. You want to make sure to maintain a balance between the flavours you are adding to your chicken. If the herbs you are using are overpowering, then it can make your chicken taste bitter.

If you want to make sure you are achieving the perfect flavour balance, you can rub your chicken with an herb and oil mixture before roasting it. This is a great way to coat your chicken evenly.
