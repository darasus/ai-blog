## What is Marketing Automation?

Marketing Automation is a set of software and services for businesses to help them manage their customer relationship management processes better.
Automation is a process that uses algorithms to remove human error and speed up the process of completing a task.
Automated processes have become increasingly popular over the last decade as businesses have realized the advantages they provide.
Marketing automation takes this one step further, by not just speeding up a process, but removing humans from it completely.

Marketing automation is a set of software services that integrates directly with your marketing channels such as email, social media, and your website. It allows you to send automated messages at the right time, and for the right person. It also allows you to measure their effectiveness and ROI.

## What is Artificial Intelligence in Marketing?

Artificial intelligence is a concept that has been explored and written about in sci-fi for a long time. Recently, though, AI has come to play an increasingly important role in the marketing world.
AI is a set of technology tools that can be used to make decisions and solve problems without human intervention.
These tools analyse large amounts of data to generate insights about your customers, your products, and other key marketing metrics.
AI is often touted as being able to replace human decision-making in many areas. This, of course, raises concerns about what will happen to the jobs of the people currently employed to do these tasks.
However, AI is still in its infancy, and the reality is that it will take some time before it is as efficient as humans.

## AI and Data Driven Marketing

As we’ve already discussed, AI is all about data. It studies data to find insights that can be put to good use by marketers. These insights could be anything from an analysis of your customers’ online behaviour, to the optimal price for a particular product. AI can also be used to automate your marketing efforts, making sure you’re sending the right content to the right person at the right time. AI is particularly useful for smaller businesses, as it can make up for a lack of resources and budget. This is because AI can be used to scale up your marketing efforts without hiring more people or expanding your budget.
AI can be used to distribute your content more widely and to find new customers through channels like social media that may have been difficult to scale in the past. It can also be used to personalise your marketing efforts, making your content more relevant to the individual reader.

## Why Is Artificial Intelligence in Marketing Important?

Marketers are always searching for new ways to grow their business and stay ahead of their competitors. AI offers a new way of doing things, which means that it can provide fresh ideas and perspectives. This, in turn, allows marketers to approach challenges in new and innovative ways.
When you work with AI, you can change how you do marketing, rather than simply doing the same thing in a different way. AI can help you discover new marketing opportunities, understand your customers better, and offer better customer experiences.

## 3 Ways AI Will Change The Way We Market

- Better Customer Insights - AI can help marketers gain insights about their customers in a variety of different ways. This will allow brands to tailor their marketing efforts to the needs of their target audience and provide a more relevant customer experience.
- More Effective Marketing - AI can also be used to make marketing campaigns more efficient. This means that you can get more from your marketing budget, ultimately allowing you to spend more on reaching more people.
- Personalized Customer Experiences - AI can also be used to tailor the content that you send to your customers. This makes your communications more personalized, and shows customers that you care about their needs and preferences. This can also help you to build stronger relationships with your customers, which can lead to stronger sales.
- Increased Automation - Another benefit of AI is that it can help marketers automate many of their tasks. This can free up time so that marketers can focus on higher-level tasks that require human decision-making.

## Bottom line

Marketers have always been forward-thinking people. They look ahead to identify new trends and technologies that could be useful in the future.
This is particularly true when it comes to the marketing industry. In the past few years, we’ve seen the emergence of many new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that could transform marketing efforts.

Now, more than ever before, marketers need to keep their finger on the pulse of emerging marketing technology and decide how best to invest in their business. AI offers a new way of doing things, which means that it can provide fresh ideas and perspectives.
