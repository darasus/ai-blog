Passive ETFs track an index, which means the fund's holdings are selected to match the composition of a specific index.\nMost ETFs are passively managed, which means they track a specific benchmark, like an index. It\\u2019s important to understand, though, that ETFs come in many different varieties and can be used to get exposure to a variety of different assets. They can be used to gain exposure to certain industries, geographical regions, or asset classes, such as stocks or bonds. `),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Understanding asset classes\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`An asset class is a group of securities that have similar risk and return characteristics. The two main types of assets are stocks and bonds.\nThe equity risk-return trade-off is the risk that comes with investing in stocks. The higher the expected return on a stock, the higher the risk that it may go down in value.\nBonds are loans that are issued by governments or companies with a promise to pay the holder regularly and with interest.\nThe return on these types of investments is lower than what you would get from stocks, but the risk is also significantly lower.\nBonds have a duration, which is the length of time it will take for the bond\\u2019s owner to get their original investment back.\nMost people invest in a mix of these two types of assets because no single asset class is a surefire way to make money.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Benefits of investing in ETFs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs provide you with diversification \\u2013 You can gain exposure to many different assets and industries through ETFs, which means your investment is less susceptible to risk.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs are cheap to buy and easy to manage \\u2013 ETFs have low management fees, and many can be purchased through a brokerage account with no trading fees.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs are transparent \\u2013 All ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs are liquid \\u2013 ETFs can easily be bought or sold at any time during the day because they trade on stock exchanges.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs are transparent \\u2013 All ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a regular basis.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"ETFs offer tax efficiency \\u2013 ETFs are designed to minimize taxes through regular distributions of profits by the fund and by holding securities that produce low capital gains.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Types of ETFs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can invest in ETFs using different strategies, such as a growth or value equity strategy.

These so-called synthetic ETFs are based on futures contracts, which are contracts to buy an asset at a certain price on a certain date.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A leveraged ETF that uses derivatives will have a multiplier that magnifies the return of the underlying index, such as 2x or 3x.
