It\\u2019s been proven by research to be a more cost-effective way to invest than buying individual stocks. In fact, most index funds charge significantly less than the average mutual fund.\nIt\\u2019s also an effective way of steering your investment dollars toward asset classes that are likely to outperform over the long term \\u2014 essentially, away from the dangers of company specific risk and toward safer but higher-yield stocks with broader market potential.\nWhile there are many different types of indexes, generally speaking, an index is a statistical measure of market performance for a given group of companies or other type of asset. An index fund is an investment that aims to track the performance of one or more indexes by holding securities that meet certain criteria as closely as possible.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
