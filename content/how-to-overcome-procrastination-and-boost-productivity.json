  "summary": "There are many potential causes of procrastination, but they all come down to two things: a bad feeling and a bad promise. The formula for procrastinating is simple: the less you want to do something, the more you promise yourself to do it. When the bad feeling of doing something outweighs the bad promise you’re making to yourself, you feel so uncomfortable you just can’t continue working. The secret to overcoming procrastina is to identify and address the causes of your procrastinations, and implement the solution that works best.",
  "intro": "As soon as you start working, you feel like procrastinating. The idea of your project seems so fascinating that you can’t wait to get back to it. Unfortunately, the time when you least want to work is exactly when you need to work. \nWorking feels like a burden and every task seems like an uphill struggle. You hate yourself for putting off something that is so beneficial for your future and your career. You’re also terrified about what will happen if you don’t finish this assignment by tomorrow. You don’t want to fail the course, lose your scholarship and end up homeless somewhere in a strange city where none of your friends live. However, all of this seems much more appealing than getting back to work on the project again; it’s even more appealing than thinking about how difficult life will be without the degree or scholarship at home.",
  "content": "## The Procrastination Equation\n\nThere are two sides to every equation, so let’s start with the positive one. TPD or Time Preference refers to the degree to which you value your time. The higher your time preference is, the more you value your time and are willing to spend it on activities that bring you closer to your goals. It also means that you don’t like spending your time on activities that don’t bring you any value.\n\nThe other side of the equation is EAP or the Expected Appreciation of Productivity. It refers to the degree to which you appreciate the benefits of your productivity. When EAP is high, you’re motivated to get things done, when it’s low, you just sit and do nothing.\n\n## What Causes Procrastination?\n\nThere are many potential causes of procrastination, but they all come down to two things:\n\n- A bad feeling.\n- A bad promise.\n\nThe bad feeling is a sense of discomfort that you experience while working on a task that you don’t really want to do.
