Do you feel like there is never enough time in the day? Perhaps your life seems like a non-stop stream of errands, appointments and chores.\nThat\\u2019s because it probably is. Many of us lead fast-paced and hectic lives where there never seems to be enough time in the day. We are constantly on the go, juggling various responsibilities and appointments. In fact, for many people, \\u201Cbusy\\u201D has become a badge of honor\\u2014a sign that they are so important and indispensable that they can\\u2019t even spare an hour to Netflix or take out the trash without an appointment.\nBut being busy isn\\u2019t always a good thing. It often means that we aren\\u2019t making time for things that are actually important, like building new relationships or dedicating time to personal development. Without making time for these things, we get caught up in the whirlwind of our everyday lives and don\\u2019t spend nearly as much time as we should focused on what matters most.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
