The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
