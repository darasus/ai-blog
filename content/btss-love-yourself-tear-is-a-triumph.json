Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'. From lyrics and themes, to production and official release date, we have got you covered!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There are no heroes in this period\\u2014just two paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a stark world where there are no easy answers.\nThe 1980s was a peak moment in that tension\\u2014from Reagan\\u2019s \\u201Cevil empire\\u201D speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe. In brief: It was not a good time to be alive if you believed in world peace.

It's also a film about performance, but it's not a concert movie. It is, however, an electrifying and exhilarating portrait of the world of jazz drumming: its practice; its professors; its players; its perfectionists. It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
