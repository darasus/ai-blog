Time blocking is a time management technique that involves dividing your day into blocks of time dedicated to specific activities. For example, you may block off an hour for email, an hour for meetings, and two hours for project work.

Time blocking can be an effective way to improve your productivity because it allows you to focus on one task at a time and eliminates distractions. When you know you only have an hour to complete a task, you are more likely to stay focused and get it done.

Time blocking can also help you to better manage your time by ensuring that you allocate enough time for each task. If you know you have a two-hour block for project work, you are less likely to procrastinate and more likely to get the work done.

Finally, time blocking can help to reduce stress because it can make your day feel more manageable. When your day is broken down into manageable blocks of time, it is easier to see how you will get everything done. This can help to reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by your to-do list.

If you are looking to improve your productivity, time blocking is a technique that is worth trying.
