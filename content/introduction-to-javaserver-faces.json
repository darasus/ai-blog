User interfaces play a vital role in how an application is perceived by its target audience.\nA user interface consists of the various screens or windows that provide access to information, or enable actions such as viewing, creating, saving, and opening files.

It can be challenging to keep all those details straight in your head, let alone find them when you need them again later on. That\\u2019s why many software engineers turn to specialized software engineering tools that streamline everyday processes and accelerate efficiency.\nWith so many options out there, it can be challenging to determine which software engineering tools will help streamline your workflow most efficiently.
