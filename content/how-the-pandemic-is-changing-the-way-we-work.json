  "summary": "Understanding how your employees value time at work can help you cultivate a culture that supports high performance and productivity without conforming to a one-size-fits-all model. When an office is quarantined, or a pandemic forces employees to take a leave of absence, virtual offices become an increasingly attractive option. A virtual office allows for continuity of work and decreases the risk of employees bringing a virus home to their families. Collaboration, culture, and wellness are all critical components of effective pandemic preparedness.",
