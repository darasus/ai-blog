Some cases require the help of a neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution process.

Whether you and your partner are separated by a few states, or even a few continents, there are ways to make things work.\nIf you and your partner both want to make the long-distance relationship work, the two of you need to be willing and committed to making it happen. You will need to put in the effort required to see this through. Fortunately, with some planning and persistence, it is possible for most couples who are separated by distance to continue their relationship.\nPreferably before moving away from each other, you and your partner should have open communication about where your relationship is heading.

You pay for it either directly by paying the mediator or indirectly by paying the lawyers. But how much does mediation cost?\nMediation costs will vary depending on where you live, the nature of your dispute, and the reputation of the mediator or firm you choose to take on your case.\nWhile some attorneys may offer their clients a choice between litigation and a certain number of hours of mediation at a reduced rate as an alternative to litigation, most attorneys charge their standard rates for mediation services.\nThe hourly rate for a private mediator may range from $100 per hour to $300 per hour or more; however, most mediators will have standard market rates that fall within that range. Many corporations and nonprofit organizations negotiate group discounts when contracting with third-party mediation services. In general, expect to spend $200 to $500 per party for a one-day mediation session with two neutral mediators and an independent arbiter.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
