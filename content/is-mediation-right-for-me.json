It is also a less expensive, private and confidential process that can help the parties reach an agreement quickly. While mediation works best when both parties are willing to negotiate and compromise, it does not always work out that way in real life. Some cases require the help of a neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution process.

And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there\\u2019s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
