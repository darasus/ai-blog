It is also a less expensive, private and confidential process that can help the parties reach an agreement quickly. While mediation works best when both parties are willing to negotiate and compromise, it does not always work out that way in real life. Some cases require the help of a neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution process.
