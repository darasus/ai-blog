Some cases require the help of a neutral third-party who can guide the parties towards coming to a settlement agreement based on fair grounds. A neutral third party known as a mediator will not take sides and instead help both parties find common ground so they can reach an agreement without going to court or any other type of resolution process.

It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability. The following article explores the ways in which mediation can help you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
