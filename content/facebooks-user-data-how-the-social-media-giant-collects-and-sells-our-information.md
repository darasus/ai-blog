Facebook has been in the news a lot lately, and not in a good way. The social media giant has been accused of collecting and selling user data without their knowledge or consent. This has led to a lot of people wondering how exactly Facebook collects and sells our information.

Facebook collects a lot of data on its users. This includes information like your name, age, gender, interests, and even your location. All of this information is then used to target ads at you. Facebook also sells this data to third-party companies, who use it to target ads at you on other websites.

This whole process has led to a lot of people feeling uneasy about using Facebook. After all, why would we want to use a service that is constantly collecting and selling our personal data? However, it's important to remember that Facebook is not the only company that does this. Almost all social media platforms and websites collect and sell user data.

So, what can we do about it? Unfortunately, not much. We can try to be more careful about what information we share on social media and websites. But at the end of the day, we can't really control what companies do with our data.
