intro: >-
  When it comes to personal development, we often think of external
  measures. We research books to read, join workshops and trainings or have
  mentors to learn from. The list goes on. All these are great ways of learning
  about the various aspects of personal growth. They push us outside our comfort
  zones and make us dig deeper into ourselves and analyze where we stand in
  life. However, there is another type of learning that is just as essential but
  not discussed much â€” self-learning . 

  Self-learning involves taking control of your own knowledge and abilities and moving from a passive learner to an active one. It involves finding ways to learn more about yourself so that you may improve as a person, understand your strengths and weaknesses, recognize your beliefs, values and goals in life, be constantly aware of what triggers you the most so you can handle those situations better the next time, understand your fears so that you can tackle them head on instead of avoiding them all your life, etc.

## Why is Self-Learning Important in Personal Development?

A significant part of a person's development happens during childhood, but most of us don't realize that we have the power to learn as adults as well. We go through life with a set of rules, beliefs and expectations that we've developed from a young age about who we are and who we should be. Oftentimes, these are based on what we felt we needed as children, what our family and society taught us and what we've experienced in life up until this point.
There are several reasons why it's important to actively engage in self-learning. It allows you to change and adapt in response to new information or life experiences. It also helps you identify your passions and values so that you can work towards what you really want in life.

## What does Self-Learning Involve?

Self-learning requires a balance between external and internal learning. External learning means you immerse yourself in information and data from various sources. It's about consuming knowledge from workshops, trainings, books, podcasts, online courses, etc. In this part, you should take note of the various things you learn as you go through various mediums. What are the key takeaways? How can you apply them to your life? What are the insights you have gained?

Internal learning involves reflecting on your own experiences. This can be anything from your childhood to the present day or even future events. You may also want to journal regularly or keep a self-learning journal that contains notes on what you've observed, felt and tried in your life, the results of your experiments, your key learnings, etc. Internal self-learning can happen naturally when you engage in active introspection or self-reflection.

## 5 Key Areas for Self-Learning in Personal Development

- Self-awareness - This is the first step towards self-learning. It is the acknowledgement of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is the understanding of your personality and your patterns in life. Once you acknowledge your strengths, weaknesses, triggers and blind spots, you can start making changes. You can start with these exercises to develop self-awareness .

- Self-confidence - Whether you are pursuing your dreams or dealing with an everyday problem, you need to be confident in yourself and your abilities. When you have a positive relationship with yourself, you are less likely to be triggered by external situations, you feel good about yourself and you are more likely to achieve your goals.

- Self-Esteem - Many people confuse self-confidence with self-esteem. While these are related, they are not the same. Self-esteem is about how you feel about yourself. If you are like most people, you fall somewhere on a spectrum of high to low self-esteem. When you have high self-esteem, you feel good about yourself. You feel positive about the person you are and what you've done. When you have low self-esteem, you may love yourself but you do not feel good about yourself. You don't feel proud of who you are.

## 3 Other Key Areas of Self-Learning

- Values and Goals - Your values and goals in life are the fuel that powers your internal engine. If you have a clear idea of what you value in life, what you want to achieve, what your dreams are and where you'd like to go from here, you are more likely to steer your life in the direction you want it to go.

- Beliefs - Beliefs are our internal rules about the world, other people, and ourselves. They are our perceptions, generalizations, and conclusions about ourselves and the world around us. Our beliefs inform our actions and our interpretation of events around us.

- Traits and Tendencies - Personality traits are the general and consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Personality traits are relatively stable across situations and over time. This means they are internal and not easily changeable or influenced by outside factors.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there is no better way to grow as a person than by self-learning. All you need to do is make it a habit and focus on these 5 key areas. You will see a significant difference in your life and progression towards your goals.
