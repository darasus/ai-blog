  "summary": "Mandatory mediation occurs when a contract or state law requires parties to try mediation before proceeding to litigation. In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. Mandatory mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud. Mediation is less formal than litigation and allows for flexibility in the process. Advantages of mediation: The parties involved in a mediation are more satisfied with their own solution as opposed to a solution imposed upon them by a judge.",
  "intro": "Mediation is a process that involves bringing together two opposing parties to resolve a conflict. It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict. \nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn’t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.",
  "content": "## What is mandatory mediation?\n\nMandatory mediation occurs when a contract or state law requires parties to certain types of disputes to try mediation before proceeding to litigation. In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. In some states, mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud.\nSome states have implemented mandatory mediation in order to reduce the amount of court cases and the expenses incurred by these parties in the court system. This is done by requiring the parties to pursue mediation before they decide to take their case to the courtroom. This helps to save a lot of time, money, and resources that could be better spent on something else.\n\n## What is voluntary mediation?\n\nVoluntary mediation is a process in which the parties involved in a dispute come to a mutual agreement without intervention from a third party such as a judge. The parties involved in a resolution process such as mediation often feel more satisfied with the outcome of the situation as opposed to being forced into a decision that didn’t satisfy both parties.\nVoluntary mediation is often chosen by people in relationships such as business partners, spouses, family members, or neighbors. In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn’t require a third party to make a decision. This means that the two parties can talk and discuss the situation as opposed to having a judge make the decision for them.\n\n## How does mediation work?\n\nThe mediator acts as a third party that facilitates discussion between the parties involved in a dispute. The mediator does not take a side and does not make a decision on the matter. Instead, he/she listens to each party and helps them come to a conclusion based on the information provided by both sides. The mediator does not give out advice, but rather facilitates a discussion between the two parties. The parties involved in the mediation process need to come to an agreement themselves and nothing can be imposed on them. The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.\nMediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions. During each session, the mediator encourages the parties to exchange information, explore options, and clarify their positions and interests. The mediator is a neutral third party who helps the parties explore alternatives to resolve the dispute and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.\n\n## Advantages of mediation\n\n- The parties involved in a mediation are more satisfied with their own solution as opposed to a solution imposed upon them by a judge.\n- The parties can save time and money that would have been spent on lawyers and court fees.\n- Mediation is confidential and does not go on a person’s record.\n- Mediation allows parties to reach an agreement that suits them as opposed to being forced into a decision.\n- Mediation is flexible and can be conducted in person or remotely.\n- Mediation is less formal than litigation and allows for flexibility in the process.\n- The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties explore options and find a solution.\n\n## Disadvantages of mediation\n\n- The process can take a long time.\n- The parties will have to come to a mutual agreement in each session and cannot impose their own solution on the other party.\n- The parties may not be satisfied with the outcome.\n- The parties may not be able to reach a solution.\n- The parties may not be able to communicate effectively during the mediation.\n- The mediation may not lead to a solution that is beneficial to both parties.\n- The mediator may not be able to remain unbiased throughout the process.\n- Mediation may not be effective when there is a severe disagreement between the parties.\n\n## Mediation in Employment Law\n\n- In an employment mediation, the mediator helps the parties to explore options and potential solutions to reduce their dispute.\n- The mediator does not take a side and helps the parties find their own solutions.\n- Both parties are able to present their arguments and discuss the issue.\n- The parties can exchange information and clarify their positions.\n- The mediator helps the parties explore options for a mutually beneficial solution.\n- Mediation can be beneficial for issues such as dismissal, disputes, or grievances.\n- It allows the parties to reach a solution that is mutually beneficial.\n\n## Mediation in Consumer Law\n\nConsumer mediation is the process by which a neutral third party helps consumers and businesses reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This neutral third party is a mediator. The mediator helps the two parties reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial to both of them.\nMediation can be a good option for consumers who are seeking to resolve a dispute with a seller or service provider. Consumers can choose mediation if they want to avoid court. Mediation is less expensive and less formal than litigation. \nA mediator can help both sides resolve their dispute more quickly and for less money than it would take to go to court. A mediator does not take sides and does not make a decision about the dispute. Instead, the mediator helps the two parties reach their own agreement. The mediator can help both sides explore their options and clarify their positions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe basics of mediation are pretty straightforward. It is where opposing parties resolve a conflict through a third party neutral intermediary. It is an alternative to going to court to resolve disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. It is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\n\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn’t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. For example, mediation can be a useful tool for couples going through a divorce. It’s a non-adversarial process where both parties have a say in the outcome."
