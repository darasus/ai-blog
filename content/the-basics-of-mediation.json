In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn\\u2019t require a third party to make a decision.

The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.\nMediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions.
