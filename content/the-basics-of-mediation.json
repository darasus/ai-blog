Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature.

In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. In some states, mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud.\nSome states have implemented mandatory mediation in order to reduce the amount of court cases and the expenses incurred by these parties in the court system. This is done by requiring the parties to pursue mediation before they decide to take their case to the courtroom. This helps to save a lot of time, money, and resources that could be better spent on something else.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"What is voluntary mediation?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Voluntary mediation is a process in which the parties involved in a dispute come to a mutual agreement without intervention from a third party such as a judge. The parties involved in a resolution process such as mediation often feel more satisfied with the outcome of the situation as opposed to being forced into a decision that didn\\u2019t satisfy both parties.\nVoluntary mediation is often chosen by people in relationships such as business partners, spouses, family members, or neighbors. In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn\\u2019t require a third party to make a decision.

The mediator does not give out advice, but rather facilitates a discussion between the two parties. The parties involved in the mediation process need to come to an agreement themselves and nothing can be imposed on them. The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.\nMediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions.

Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019t not the same thing as arbitration or negotiation. Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral third party, the mediator, assists others in exploring issues, managing conflict, and solving problems in an effort to resolve conflict and move forward. The parties involved in the dispute remain control over their own destiny at all times. They are free to walk away from mediation at any time with no consequence. The goal of mediation is not compromise but resolution. It\\u2019t win-win or lose-lose but instead find a place somewhere between those two extremes where both parties can feel satisfied with the outcome of their dispute.  Mediation services are often provided by private organizations such as nonprofit community mediation centers or faith-based centers that offer these services pro bono publico, which means \\u201Cfor the good of the public\\u201D without charge.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
