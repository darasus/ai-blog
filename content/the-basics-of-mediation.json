In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. In some states, mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud.\nSome states have implemented mandatory mediation in order to reduce the amount of court cases and the expenses incurred by these parties in the court system. This is done by requiring the parties to pursue mediation before they decide to take their case to the courtroom. This helps to save a lot of time, money, and resources that could be better spent on something else.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"What is voluntary mediation?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Voluntary mediation is a process in which the parties involved in a dispute come to a mutual agreement without intervention from a third party such as a judge. The parties involved in a resolution process such as mediation often feel more satisfied with the outcome of the situation as opposed to being forced into a decision that didn\\u2019t satisfy both parties.\nVoluntary mediation is often chosen by people in relationships such as business partners, spouses, family members, or neighbors. In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn\\u2019t require a third party to make a decision.

The mediator does not give out advice, but rather facilitates a discussion between the two parties. The parties involved in the mediation process need to come to an agreement themselves and nothing can be imposed on them. The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.\nMediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions.

Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company. Fortunately, training your dog to go to bed is fairly easy with some dedication from you!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
