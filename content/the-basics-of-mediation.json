In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. In some states, mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud.\nSome states have implemented mandatory mediation in order to reduce the amount of court cases and the expenses incurred by these parties in the court system.

In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn\\u2019t require a third party to make a decision.

The mediator does not give out advice, but rather facilitates a discussion between the two parties. The parties involved in the mediation process need to come to an agreement themselves and nothing can be imposed on them. The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.\nMediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions.

It is not a trial, nor does it involve judging or advocacy. Rather, mediation is a collaborative process where both sides work with neutral third-party mediators to resolve their dispute and come to an agreement that\\u2019s fair and equitable for all involved.\nMediation can take as long as each party needs it to take and no longer than that. Depending on the case, mediation sessions can last anywhere from one hour to multiple days. The time frame will depend largely on multiple factors including:\nMediation sessions are confidential, so there isn\\u2019t a set end time like you might experience in court or arbitration proceedings. Instead, parties can chose to end mediation at any point if they feel they\\u2019ve reached the best possible outcome for themselves and the other party involved.

In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person\\u2019s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.\nAdditionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial.
