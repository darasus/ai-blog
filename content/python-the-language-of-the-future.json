When it comes to system administration and monitoring, the list of available solutions is nearly endless. There are numerous cloud-based offerings that make light work of monitoring resource usage and uptime. For performance monitoring and analysis, there are platform-specific solutions, such as New Relic or App Dynamics for applications written in Python or other popular languages. There are also general solutions like Statsd and Prometheus for collecting performance metrics from any program on your network. The list goes on\\u2014you can find anything from standard logging utilities to software-defined networking (SDN) controllers if you know where to look.\nThere are so many different tools that choosing one to learn as a system administrator can be challenging.

There will always be some kind of error or unexpected event that could happen during execution of a program. These issues are referred to as \\u201Cexceptions\\u201D, and they may take many forms. For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state. Thus, we have exception handling in Java to deal with these edge cases gracefully so that our applications keep functioning properly in spite of them.
