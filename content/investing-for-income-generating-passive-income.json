Diversifying your portfolio helps you manage risk and reduce the negative effects of a single investment falling dramatically in value.\nIf you invest your money in only one stock, mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you\\u2019re exposed to the risk that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket. If that stock plunges in value, so does your entire investment. But if you diversify across different types of investments, it\\u2019s more likely that at least some of your holdings will not suffer a similar fate.\nA well-diversified portfolio includes numerous asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash; several sizes and types of companies; and perhaps even real estate and alternative assets like private equity or venture capital trusts.
