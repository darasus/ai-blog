  a brand that they trust, and a big part of building trust is showing customers

intro: >-
  The failure rate for startups is high. Even the most experienced founders
  will often launch a new business and see it fail, sometimes several times
  over. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the risks involved with
  launching a startup by testing your idea as early as possible with inexpensive
  methods. 

  Startup failure is an unfortunate but inevitable part of the startup process. Even if you have great ideas and the best team possible, not every company is going to succeed. In fact, according to research from Harvard Business School, about two-thirds of all startups fail within the first five years. However, that doesn’t mean that launching a startup is a risky venture that you should avoid at all costs.

  If you’re thinking about starting your own business and feel like your idea could be a profitable business venture in the long-term, read on to discover some common reasons why startups fail so that you can take measures to avoid those pitfalls in your business plan before it’s too late.

## Out of Pocket Money

When a startup requires capital to get off the ground, it is often difficult to find investors who will agree to fund the company without a significant payback plan. This can be problematic if you’re using your own money to get your business off the ground—especially if you’re not sure if your business will be successful.

If you decide to start your company without any money invested of your own, then you don’t have to worry about losing your savings if your startup fails. However, having no skin in the game can also be problematic because you may be less willing to make difficult decisions for the good of your business since you don’t have any personal assets tied up in it.

## No Clear Value Proposition

A company’s value proposition is the reason why customers should buy from them instead of their competitors. If you can’t clearly articulate why customers should buy from your company instead of your competitors, then you’re likely to have a difficult time gaining traction. Customers are more likely to buy from a brand that they trust, and a big part of building trust is showing customers why your company is a better choice than your competitors.

Before you launch your business, make sure you understand why customers would buy your product or service. If you don’t have a clear value proposition, then you may want to start brainstorming ways to clarify your company’s benefits or reevaluate your product idea until you’ve found something that resonates with your target audience.

## Poor Timing

Timing is everything, and there are many examples of startups that had a great product with a solid business model but failed to get traction because the market wasn’t ready for them. If you’re launching a new product or service, timing is important because if you enter the market too early but your market isn’t ready for your product, you may end up burning through too much funding without gaining any traction.

If you start a new business and realize that you’ve entered the market at the wrong time, you may be able to pivot your business model to reach a new market with a more advantageous timing strategy or reevaluate your product idea until you find something that is better timed.

## No Proven Problem/Solution

Sometimes you may be so passionate about your idea that you skip the step of validating that there’s a real problem you can solve for your market. This can be a big mistake because even if you have an amazing product, you won’t be able to reach your full potential if you don’t have a clear path to acquiring customers.

Before you launch your business, you need to be able to prove that your product solves a real problem for your market. If you don’t have a proven solution for your customers’ problems, then you won’t be able to get traction in the marketplace.
Ever heard the saying, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all?” Well, that same advice applies here. Before you launch your business, make sure you can prove that you’re solving a real problem for your market.

## Incorrect User Acquisition Strategy

Once you’ve proven that your product solves a problem and you’re ready to start acquiring customers, you need to be careful about how you go about doing that. Many startups make the mistake of spending too much time marketing their product before they even have customers. This can be problematic because you’ll likely spend more on marketing than you’ll be able to make with a new company unless you have an unlimited budget.

Before you start spending money on acquiring customers, make sure you have a clear acquisition strategy that is likely to produce results. If you start spending money on marketing too soon, you may run out of funds before you’ve acquired a significant customer base.
If you have a great product and are confident that you can acquire customers organically, then you may want to consider spending your marketing funds more wisely on customer acquisition strategies that will produce a higher ROI.

## Company Culture Problems

Great company culture is important for startups because it can help increase employee satisfaction, retention, and productivity. However, if you don’t start with a solid foundation, you may find that company culture problems start to emerge. You can avoid this by building strong team dynamics from the beginning and making culture fit a priority.

Before you hire your first employees, set the standard for company culture by creating a strong team dynamic that includes core values and an onboarding process that helps new hires understand how they can contribute to the company culture. If you don’t set the standard for company culture early on and it’s left up to individual employees to create their own culture, you may find that some of your team members don’t fit with your company’s values. This can lead to problems down the road.

## Conclusion

When a startup fails, it’s often due to a combination of these common reasons. In most cases, there was nothing inherently wrong with the product or business model; the company just encountered a few unfortunate situations that were out of their control.

If you can identify the reasons why startups fail and take steps to avoid them in your own business plan, then you’ll be increasingly likely to succeed. With that in mind, there’s no better time to start planning for the future of your company than right now.
