Finding that next challenge can seem challenging at first, but once you understand your strengths, it becomes much easier.\nCoding like a pro is not an easy task. The world of programming has lots of competition, so developers need to stand out from the crowd if they want to succeed and thrive in this industry.\nUnfortunately, there are too many coders who don\\u2019t know how to code like a pro \\u2013 which means that these programmers aren\\u2019t able to reach their potential or get jobs in companies where they can continue their growth as software engineers.\nThat doesn\\u2019t mean that these coders are bad or won\\u2019t ever be good programmers; it just means that they have some areas that they could improve on right now.
