  "summary": "The difference between productivity and being “busy” is that being busy is pretty much just being frenzied and frantic with no real direction or purpose. Productivity, on the other hand, is the process of taking action towards achieving your goals and building a meaningful life. When you make time for productivity, you are taking the time to reflect on what your priorities are and then scheduling time to work towards those goals. The Hidden Benefit of Making Time for productivity is setting aside time to focus on what matters most to you.",
