## Trump’s Celebrity Status

Donald Trump has been a household name since the 1980s, both in his native New York and beyond. His fame came from his position as a real-estate mogul and reality television star, but it was his claim to fame as a tabloid cover star that put him on the map.
In the 2000s, Trump became a pop culture staple, with every appearance making headlines across the world. From his many marriages to his alleged affairs and the various scandals surrounding his business ventures, Trump’s name was always in the news.
In 2016, after spending years fueling his celebrity status by discussing his political views with the media, Trump’s fame catapulted him to the Republican Party nomination and eventually, to the presidency.
Trump’s presidency is rife with celebrity culture. From hosting celebrities at the White House to appearing on reality television shows, Trump’s administration has taken the Hollywood-ization of politics to a new level.

## Why Celebrities Run for Office

Celebrities are not presidential candidates by nature. In fact, the opposite is true. They run to get away from the limelight, hoping to gain some privacy and normalcy after years of constant tabloid attention.
But fame and politics are a curious match. Being in the public eye, many celebrities are well-known for their philanthropy and social activism. Many are involved with global issues, including poverty and climate change.
They may have the financial freedom to donate to charitable causes, but not many celebrities have the political power to make a real difference.
And so, many celebrities run for office, hoping to get involved in government to make a lasting change.

Celebrities running for office is a new phenomenon that is currently on the rise. While there are no exact numbers, it’s easy to see that the trend is growing. From musicians like Kid Rock and Kanye West to athletes like Serena Williams and Steph Curry, more and more celebrities are joining the political fray. Many of them are running as Democrats, hoping to unseat conservative Republican representatives.

## The Trump Effect

The Trump effect is evident in the wave of celebrities who have thrown their hat into the political ring. While having a president who is also a celebrity is nothing new, having so many celebrities run for office as a result of his presidency is.
And it’s not just a Democratic Party trend. The Republican Party has its own share of celebrity candidates, including actor Antonio Sabato Jr., former model and beauty queen Ashley Graham, and musician Kid Rock.

The rise of celebrities in politics has even prompted The Washington Post to create a database tracking celebrity candidates. The Post’s “The 2020 Candidatariat” is a weekly column that follows the candidacies of non-politicians in the hopes of bringing more light and coverage to this new trend.

## Pros of Having a Celebrity President

Celebrities have access to a massive audience. With millions of followers on social media, and even more who follow them through the news, celebrities have the potential to sway public opinion with a single tweet or Instagram Story.
While having a president who can actively use and engage with social media is a plus, it’s unclear whether having a president who has spent their entire career in the spotlight is beneficial. After all, celebrities are more used to being the face of an organization than being the leader of a nation.
Moreover, having a president who has spent his or her whole career in the public eye has its own drawbacks. In the past, celebrities have been scrutinized for a lack of knowledge in current affairs and an inability to commit to a political party.

## Cons of Having a Celebrity President

Just as there are positive aspects to having a celebrity as president, there are negative ones as well. Pop culture figures may be very vocal and influential, but they do not necessarily have the qualities of a good leader.
People admire celebrities because they are famous. But presidential candidates should be well-known for a reason other than their money or fame.
Having a president who has spent their entire career in the spotlight has its drawbacks. Celebrities may be passionate and influential, but they lack the experience that comes with spending years in government.
Moreover, celebrities are people, and people make mistakes. Famous faces who enter the political ring must be prepared to face the scrutiny of an even more critical public eye.

## Conclusion

The rise of celebrities in the political arena is not a new phenomenon, but one that has been growing for decades. What is new is the way in which celebrities are now entering the political scene.

Celebrities are now running for office rather than simply endorsing a candidate or throwing their support behind a cause. While this is a positive development for pop culture, it brings with it a new set of challenges and scrutiny that many may not be prepared for.

If a candidate has spent their entire career in the spotlight, the public will expect them to have all the answers whenever they are faced with an issue. This is something that the best and brightest public servants can struggle with.
