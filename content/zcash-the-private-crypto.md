  ZCash is a digital currency that aims to bring unprecedented privacy to
  the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. If you’re reading this, you’re
  likely aware that this is an area ripe with potential, but also rife with
  risk. Crypto has been dogged by associations with black markets, hackers and
  scams; as a result, adoption rates have been slow and regulators are keeping a
  watchful eye on the market.

  If you're interested in investing in ZCash or any other type of cryptocurrency, it’s important for you to understand what makes each token unique. While some tokens may be more profitable than others in the long-term, your own personal investment strategy should be at the forefront when making decisions like these. 

  This blog post aims to provide insight into what makes ZCash stand out from other cryptocurrencies, why some might view that as a positive or negative thing and what implications it could have on its future value.

## What is ZCash?

ZCash is a decentralized cryptocurrency that aims to bring unprecedented privacy to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. In the same way that Bitcoin has revolutionized the way we store and exchange value, ZCash aims to revolutionize the way we store and exchange information.
ZCash is a unique cryptocurrency in that it allows for both public and private transactions. This allows for users to control their own privacy settings, with public transactions accessible by every user, and private transactions only visible to the sender, receiver and those they give permission to.
ZCash was first released in 2016 by Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of the company behind the currency, Zerocoin Electric Company. It came under the Zerocash Protocol and was rebranded to ZCash later that year.
ZCash started trading on many exchanges shortly after, with its value fluctuating between $10 and $15 per coin. The price has since settled at around $128 per coin as of June 2019.

## Why is Privacy Important in Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that allows for the secure and transparent transfer of data. While this is great for financial transactions, blockchain can also be used to secure sensitive information like medical records and contracts. In fact, recent research suggests that blockchain could be the solution to data privacy issues.
Unfortunately, the details of blockchain are visible to everyone. This means that if your company or organization chooses to store sensitive information on a blockchain network, any hacker who gains access to that data would also be able to see exactly how the information is being used.
This can be disastrous, particularly in industries like healthcare that depend on strict privacy laws. In addition, some stakeholders may not want to share their data with the entire blockchain network.
This is where ZCash comes in. The currency allows users to encrypt their data so that only those involved in the transaction can see it. This is crucial for industries like healthcare that need to maintain strict data privacy laws.

## How does ZCash Achieve Privacy?

ZCash uses a concept called “zero knowledge proof” to achieve privacy. A zero knowledge proof means that someone can verify that something is true without knowing the details of the transaction. ZCash uses this concept to encrypt the details of a transaction — sender, receiver, amount and other information.
This is done by splitting the transaction into two parts. One part is a public record of the transaction, and the other is a private record that is only visible to the sender and the receiver.
ZCash achieves privacy in a number of ways. Firstly, the public record is accessible only through a blockchain explorer — and even then, only the amount of the transaction is visible. The public record also shows that the transaction was made on the ZCash blockchain, not on the blockchain of the company or organization using ZCash to transact.
ZCash also allows for shielded transactions, which are private transactions that are visible only to the sender, receiver and those they decide to share the details of the transaction with.

## Zcash and Bitcoin – similarities and differences

ZCash and Bitcoin are both decentralized cryptocurrencies that allow users to control their own finances without the need for a bank or third party. However, there are some key differences between the two.
ZCash is built on the blockchain provided by Proof of Work (PoW), which relies on miners solving complex mathematical problems to add transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin is also built on the PoW blockchain, but uses a simpler mining process that requires less computing power.
ZCash also allows for private transactions, as described above. Bitcoin does not provide this option, so all transactions are public. This means that every transaction made with Bitcoin is visible to every person on the blockchain. This can be a huge disadvantage for companies that need to keep their finances private.
ZCash also has a slightly different mining process that is not as energy-intensive as PoW mining. It uses a process called Equihash that is designed to be both energy-efficient and memory-intensive.

## Zcash Investment Advice

ZCash is a promising cryptocurrency, but it’s important that you do your research before making an investment. While some tokens may be more profitable than others in the long-term, your own personal investment strategy should be at the forefront when making decisions like these.
You should also be aware of the risks involved with investing in cryptocurrencies. For example, cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated and could be vulnerable to government regulation in the future. If a country decides to ban the use of cryptocurrencies, the value of existing tokens could drop.
ZCash has been around for a few years and is one of the most established cryptocurrencies in the industry. However, that doesn’t guarantee future success. You should carefully consider your investment strategy before buying ZCash.
You should also educate yourself on the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, as well as the potential rewards. You can do this by reading articles like this one and joining online communities where people discuss everything related to blockchain and cryptocurrency.

## Final Words

ZCash is a promising cryptocurrency and could be a valuable asset for blockchain companies. However, you should approach investing in any cryptocurrency with caution. You should research each token and carefully consider your investment strategy before making a decision.
You can do this by reading articles like this one, joining online communities and educating yourself on the risks and rewards associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.
