Do you have the ability to assimilate new information and learn from your mistakes quickly? How about self-learning skills? If the answers to these questions are in the negative, then it\\u2019s time for you to take some serious action.\nSelf-learning is a continuous process and not something that happens only once or twice in one\\u2019s lifetime. In fact, it is an ongoing, never-ending process. It is a way of thinking, an approach to learning and a set of strategies that can be used at any point in time. Self-learning is basically learning how to learn, so that we can continue to grow even after finishing school or university.\nEven adults prefer different methods of learning such as reading books on their own instead of listening to lectures or attending group classes. There are numerous ways through which you can tap into your inherent abilities and cater to your specific needs as an adult learner. These tips will help you hack your self-learning skills in no time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
