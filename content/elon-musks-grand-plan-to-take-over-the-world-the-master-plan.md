summary: Elon Musk has said that he wants to merge all of his companies under
  one name to create an entirely new industry. The Boring Company is a company
  that wants to create a network of tunnels beneath cities like Los Angeles and
  New York. He also wants to use these tunnels to create transportation systems
  that can transport pedestrians and cyclists. Musk has already created the
  world’s largest artificial solar power plant and SolarCity, which is worth $2
  billion. In 2017, Musk founded AI company Neuralink, which focuses on the
  relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. He said that AI is
  actually something to be excited about.
intro: >-
  Elon Musk is not just the CEO of one company, but the CEO of several. And
  not just that; he has a hand in many more companies as an advisor or board
  member. His main company, Tesla, may be dealing with its fair share of
  problems right now, but it’s just one of his many ventures. 

  The world has come to know Musk as an inventor and investor who drives forward the future with ideas such as electric cars and Hyperloop trains. In fact, you may already be familiar with his other companies if you follow him on Twitter or Instagram. He’s also been hailed as a new version of Steve Jobs for his work overseeing so many different projects at once.

  If you’re an Elon fan — or a potential job applicant — here’s everything you need to know about his companies and plans for the future:

## SpaceX

Founded in 2002, SpaceX is a commercial rocket company that is already the world’s most powerful. It’s set to become even more powerful, however, as Musk has said that it’s only a matter of a few years before he can start launching thousands of spaceships that are capable of taking 100 people to Mars at a time.
This ambitious project will be called the Big Falcon Rocket or BFR, and it is set to be the key to Musk’s plans to take over the world. The mission is to create a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, and the BFR will be the only way to get there.

But Musk has said that he also wants the BFR to do so much more. He wants it to replace all of the company’s current rockets, and he wants to use it to create a giant network of worldwide travel that’s completely reusable. He also wants BFR to have a side job of beaming down high-speed internet to developing countries.

## Tesla

Tesla is a luxury electric car manufacturer that’s been making cars for a decade now. Tesla’s first car, the Roadster, was an instant hit. The second car, the Model S, was also an instant success, and it’s still being manufactured today.
Yet Tesla is much more than just a car company. Musk has said that his main goal with Tesla is to create a sustainable energy source that can generate electricity without any harmful emissions.
And Tesla has already started to achieve this huge feat. It has already created the world’s largest artificial solar power plant, and it has also begun manufacturing a new solar roof product that will be available in the next few years. Tesla’s solar panels are so popular that thousands of people have even signed up to buy them before they’ve even been released.

## SolarCity

SolarCity is the world’s leading solar power company. It is currently worth $2 billion and, in the past few years, has become the most popular solar power company in the U.S.
Along with Musk’s other ventures, SolarCity is the key to his plans to completely switch the world over to an environmentally sustainable source of power.
SolarCity is the brainchild of Musk’s cousin, Lyndon Rive, and his brother Peter. Musk has since bought out his cousins, but the company is still a huge part of his plans. It’s not just a solar power company, though; it’s also a company that manufactures solar panels, installs solar systems, and finances solar systems for homeowners and businesses. SolarCity is already worth $2 billion, but Musk has said that he wants to expand the company by hiring 100 more employees and expanding its solar-powered offerings even further.

## AI Company

What would you do if you were the CEO of two of the world’s most innovative companies? If you’re Elon Musk, you create a brand new company that focuses on artificial intelligence.
In 2017, Musk founded Neuralink, which is a company that wants to create a symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. Most people are currently worried about the rise of AI, but Musk has said that AI is actually something to be excited about.
However, he does think that we’ll need to merge with AI before it becomes too powerful for us to control. He believes that we’ll need to create a neural lace — which is basically a computer enhanced into your brain — to keep up with AI’s rising intelligence. Musk has said that he expects the company to fully launch in 10 years.

## Boring Company

The Boring Company is a company that Musk founded as a joke. He tweeted that he wanted to create a “funny name” for a new company, and the response was so overwhelming that he actually created the company. The Boring Company’s goal is to make digging tunnels cheaper and more efficient.
In reality, Musk wants to use the Boring Company to create a network of tunnels beneath cities like Los Angeles and New York. He wants to use these tunnels to create much more efficient transportation systems. The company has already completed one tunnel, and Musk has said that he wants to expand its operations.
His main goal with the Boring Company is to create tunnels that can transport cars at high speeds via electric skates. He also wants to use these tunnels to transport pedestrians and cyclists.

## Merging Companies

Musk has said that he wants to merge all of his companies under one name to create an entirely new industry. He thinks that Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX are all such innovative companies that they deserve to be merged together under one company name.
And he’s already started to make this happen. SpaceX is currently working on a project to install solar panels on Hawaiian houses, and Tesla is producing batteries for Hawaiian households that are powered by solar.
These projects are just the beginning of Musk’s plans to merge his companies. He has said that he wants to bring AI into the mix as well, and he wants all of his companies to work together as one giant company.

## Conclusion

Musk is an inventor who has an audacious yet achievable plan to create sustainable sources of energy, build a new infrastructure and transport system, end human disease, explore and colonize other planets, and build and grow sustainable human civilizations in the process. His companies are already producing results, and they will likely play an important role in achieving his ambitious goals.
