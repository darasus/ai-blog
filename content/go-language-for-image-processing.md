summary: Go is an ideal language for low-level systems where performance is a
  critical concern. The language’s built-in concurrency model lets developers
  write programs with many running processes. Go compiles to native code that
  can run on multiple platforms without needing to be rewritten. Go is also a
  good language for webcam streaming and image manipulation. Go code compiles
  directly to machine code (native code) for each specific hardware platform. Go
  programs don’t run in a virtual machine like other systems written in
  languages like Python or Ruby.
intro: >-
  Go is an emerging general-purpose programming language that has many
  advantages for creating software. It’s simple, fast, and predictable with no
  unnecessary syntax and a lightweight syntax that leads to programs that are
  easy to read and understand.

  Go has several built-in features that let it stand out from other general programming languages. For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don’t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics. 

  This article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.

## Reduced Development Time

Writing code in Go is a relatively straightforward task, thanks to its clean syntax and lack of excessive syntax. This makes it easy for new developers to get up to speed with the language quickly and lets them focus on the functionality of the code rather than the syntax itself. This, in turn, cuts down on development time and leads to faster iterations during the development process.

Another advantage of using Go is that it compiles to native code that can run on multiple platforms without needing to be rewritten. This native code has fewer dependencies than code written in other programming languages. Dependencies such as third-party libraries can slow down development and create additional maintenance burdens as those dependencies change over time. By using Go, you can sidestep these issues.

## High Performance

Developers often use Go for low-level systems where performance is a critical concern. Several factors contribute to Go’s high performance. First, the compiler used to create executable binaries from Go code is highly optimized for speed. Second, Go code compiles directly to machine code (native code) for each specific hardware platform. This means that Go programs don’t run in a virtual machine like other systems written in languages like Python or Ruby.

Finally, Go’s runtime is lightweight, which means that it doesn’t use a lot of system resources even when running in a production environment. This is especially important for low-level systems that may need to process a huge amount of data.

## Concurrency Support

Go’s built-in concurrency model lets developers write programs with many running processes. This is useful in production environments where multiple computers are processing the same data and it’s necessary to coordinate those processes to avoid data corruption.
Go’s concurrency model is simple, and the language’s syntax lets you write programs that coordinate concurrent processes without getting too bogged down in the details of the model. This makes it easier to focus on the logic of your program rather than the low-level details of how to manage concurrent processes.

While concurrency is an important feature, it’s important to note that it’s not a silver bullet. Using concurrency is a complicated process, and it’s important to use it correctly to avoid data corruption and other issues.

## Writing Image Processing Libraries in Go

Image processing libraries in Go are a popular use case for the language. Although Go doesn’t have built-in image processing capabilities, it’s easy to create libraries for manipulating images within the language.
Go’s built-in libraries are lightweight, which means that image processing libraries can use as few resources as possible while still offering robust functionality. This makes Go an ideal language for writing image processing libraries that work across multiple platforms without requiring too much system resources.

## Webcam Streaming with Go

Webcam streaming is a popular use case for Go. Many companies use webcam streaming to let remote employees participate in virtual meetings. This might involve using a camera connected to a computer to stream video of employees at remote sites.
Go has many built-in libraries that make it easy to interact with external devices like webcams, making it a good language for webcam streaming.

Another advantage of using Go for webcam streaming is that it’s easy to create a program that’s concurrent. This is important because it means that multiple processes can interact with the webcam at the same time. This is necessary for webcam streaming because multiple streams must be sent to different remote computers.

## Photo Manipulation with Go

Go is an ideal language for performing image manipulation tasks. Go’s standard image library has many built-in functions for manipulating images. This makes it easy to perform basic tasks like resizing images or applying filters.
There are also several third-party libraries that provide additional functionality for image processing tasks such as GoImager and Goxer. These libraries let you perform more complex image manipulation tasks such as applying machine learning algorithms on images.

## Conclusion

Go is an ideal language for image processing tasks because it’s easy to write code and there’s a built-in library for manipulating images. Many popular image processing functions are available in the standard library, and third-party libraries let you perform more complex image manipulation tasks.

Go is also an ideal language for webcam streaming and photo manipulation because it’s easy to write code and there’s a built-in library for manipulating images. Finally, Go’s concurrency model is useful for programs that involve multiple processes.
