## Tasks And Responsibilities Of Software Engineers

As we’ve discussed, software engineering is a broad field that encompasses a number of sub-disciplines. In order to understand the tasks and responsibilities of engineers in each of these areas, let’s take a closer look at each one.

Systems Engineers - These engineers specialize in designing and developing large-scale systems used in industrial, commercial, or government applications. They create solutions that are often used in manufacturing, finance, healthcare, and other industries. A systems engineer might create software that tracks inventory, manages energy consumption, or allows government agencies to collect taxes.

Application Engineers - These engineers develop software that is used by individuals and/or organizations on a standard, everyday basis. This might include creating applications for business management, customer relationship management, infrastructure management, or medical device design.

Architects - As software engineers advance in their careers, they often transition into the role of architect. Architects are responsible for managing teams and projects, and designing solutions that meet the needs of the business. Because of the high-level of responsibility in this role, architects must possess exceptional communication skills, be able to think strategically, and have a strong knowledge of the industry.
