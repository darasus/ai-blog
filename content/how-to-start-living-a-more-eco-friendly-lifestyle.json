Putting your dog in a boarding facility or kennel isn\\u2019t an easy decision for most pet owners, especially if you have a sensitive breed (i.e., lots of barking = unhappy dogs). So how can you get your pup ready to be on their own? It\\u2019s not as simple as locking them in a closet for a few hours once or twice and then expecting them to be cool with it. Dogs don\\u2019t think like people; they don\\u2019t understand symbolic actions like turning off the light as meaning that you won\\u2019t be coming back home tonight. They have instinctual fear responses that need to be addressed specifically with training and care before leaving them alone.'))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
