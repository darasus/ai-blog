summary: Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories and
  converts them into energy. It’s the minimum amount of calories your body needs
  to function properly and stay alive. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) accounts
  for only a fraction of the calories you burn in a day. The rest is accounted
  for by the thermic effect of food (TEF) and activity level. TEF is the number
  of calories that are burned to digest food, which means the more you eat, the
  more calories you spend digesting it.
intro: "Your metabolism is essentially the rate at which your body burns
  calories and converts them into energy. It’s a process that happens
  automatically, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it has a huge impact on
  how many calories you burn every day and how much weight you could potentially
  lose if you change your diet to reflect an exercise program. You see, your
  metabolism is responsible for burning all the fat in your body. Every single
  calorie you take in from food is first stored as fat somewhere in your body,
  and then broken down to be used as energy – the very thing that powers
  everything you do from breathing to blinking. Metabolism has several
  components that work together to help maintain it:"

## Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

The first thing we need to address when discussing metabolism is the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of calories your body burns when at rest. It’s the minimum amount of calories your body needs to function properly and stay alive. BMR can be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, which estimates your daily caloric needs based on your sex, age, and weight. There’s a catch here, though: BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day. The rest is accounted for by the thermic effect of food (TEF), which is the amount of calories that are burned to digest food, and activity level, which is the amount of calories burned due to daily activities.

## Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)

If BMR accounts for only a fraction of the calories your body burns in a day, then TEF accounts for the rest. TEF is the number of calories that are burned to digest food, which means the more you eat, the more calories you spend digesting it. For example, let’t say you eat a medium sized baked potato (300 calories) with a large piece of salmon (100 calories). You have just consumed 400 calories, and your body will have to spend about 100 calories to digest them, leaving you with a net total of 300 calories. That means that if you’re eating the recommended 2,000 calories per day, you’re spending the same amount of calories on digestion that you’re consuming through food, leaving you with a daily calorie deficit – which is the key to weight loss.

## Activity Level

We all know how important exercise is for weight loss, but what most people don’t know is that it also helps boost metabolism. That means the more you exercise, the more calories you burn every day. Almost every part of your body is involved in the process of metabolism, which means you can affect it in many ways. For example, muscle mass burns calories even when you’re not exercising, so the more muscle you have on your frame, the more calories you burn every day. On the other hand, your metabolic rate goes down when you’re under stress, so the more you can manage your stress levels, the better your metabolism will be.

## Body Type

Your body type is determined by your genes and how your body responds to the environment you’re in. For example, if you’re an ectomorph, you’re naturally thin and lean and have a fast metabolism, whereas if you’re an endomorph, you’re naturally heavier in build with a slower metabolism. Your metabolic rate is affected by your body type, and it’s something that can’t really be changed through diet or exercise. For example, if you have a very fast metabolism, you can eat all the healthiest foods in the world and exercise as much as you want, but you’ll probably never gain weight. On the other hand, if you have a very slow metabolism, you can eat nothing but broccoli, and you’ll probably never lose weight.

## Gender

Men and women metabolisms are very different, and the main reason behind this is hormones. Women’s bodies burn more calories than men’s due to their higher hormone levels, which is why men are more likely to gain weight than women, even when they eat and exercise the same amount. That said, the differences between genders are very subtle and not as drastic as you may have thought. For example, in a man who weighs 80kg and a woman who weighs 60kg, the woman will burn about 50 more calories per day than the man. That said, the difference between men and women is enough to cause some variation in weight loss and dietary needs.

## Conclusion

Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories and converts them into energy. It’s a process that happens automatically, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it has a huge impact on how many calories you burn every day and how much weight you could potentially lose if you change your diet to reflect an exercise program.

There are several components that work together to help maintain your metabolism, including basal metabolic rate, the thermic effect of food, and activity level. Your body type, gender, and diet can also affect your metabolism.
