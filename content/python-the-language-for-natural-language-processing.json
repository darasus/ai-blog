That\\u2019s exactly what has happened with Python though, which is why in this article you will learn all you need to know about this programming language and why it\\u2019s the best choice for your next project.\nThere are plenty of programming languages available right now, each with their own unique pros and cons. However, not all of them manage to capture hearts and minds like Python has. This dynamic general-purpose programming language has become one of the most commonly used since its release in 1991 and remains so today. In fact, as we look ahead at trends in AI, data science and machine learning, there\\u2019s every indication that Python will continue to grow in popularity for years to come.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
