Software engineering is a broad field that includes several sub-disciplines. Each of these areas has its own unique set of responsibilities and tasks. As an engineer, you might specialize in one or more of these disciplines, but regardless of your area of focus, every software engineer must have a solid understanding of all the different aspects in order to be successful in this exciting career. In this article, we\\u2019ll explore some of the many benefits of software engineering. If you\\u2019re reading this thinking \\u201CIs this article for me?\\u201D keep reading!

That\\u2019s where Python comes into play. As an automation scripting language, it can help you automate even the simplest of tasks and free up more time for work that matters.
