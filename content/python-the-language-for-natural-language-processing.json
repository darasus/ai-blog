The primary benefit of natural language processing is that it allows users to communicate with a machine in a way they are most comfortable with. Computers can now understand, process, and react to human speech.  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of artificial intelligence that enables computers to detect and understand human speech as well as written words. It involves the techniques and algorithms related to natural language processing such Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Information Retrieval, and Computer Speech Recognition.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
