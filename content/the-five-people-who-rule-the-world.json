Fame is something you can quantify and measure. The most important things in our world are difficult to understand and often intangible.\nThe economy, climate change, and the war in Syria are all massively important things, but because they\\u2019re complicated and difficult to understand, we tend to ignore them.

Since then, the media has played an enormous role in shaping who we spend our time thinking about and who we build into celebrities.\nThe rise of the internet created a whole new world of celebrity obsession, but social media has taken things even further.

When combined with pressures from outside forces, this unique structure led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe rise and fall of the Soviet Union can be traced back to Vladimir Lenin and his Marxist ideology. In 1917, Lenin led the Bolshevik Revolution and gained control over Russia. At this time, he also introduced policies that would help establish communism throughout Russia and other areas \\u2013 known as \\u201Cthe fourth partition\\u201D \\u2013 controlled by his Red Army.
