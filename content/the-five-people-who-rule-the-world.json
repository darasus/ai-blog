Celebrities have always been important, but never before have they held so much power. Musicians are the most powerful people in the world, even though they're not a political or economic force. Actors are just slightly less important than musicians, but the power of actresses is growing rapidly. The most famous actors are also the best actors, but are not the best actresses.",

They\\u2019re on our phones, on our TV screens, and even in our news feeds.

If you\\u2019ve ever seen someone on their phone and wondered why they\\u2019re not paying attention to you, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re probably looking at a picture of Kylie Jenner.\nWith all this in mind, let\\u2019s look at how much celebrities rule the world by the numbers.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"We\\u2019re obsessed with fame, and that shapes everything\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The first thing to understand about why celebrities rule the world is that we\\u2019re incredibly obsessed with fame. Celebrities are famous, but we\\u2019re not obsessed with them the way we used to be. Celebrities used to be people whose job was to be famous. We\\u2019re obsessed with the idea of fame, not the people who are famous for being famous. We\\u2019re obsessed with the idea of being famous, being Instagram famous, or being Snapchat famous. We\\u2019re obsessed with people knowing our names and recognizing our faces.\nWe\\u2019re obsessed with fame because it\\u2019s a quality that is easy to understand. Fame is something you can quantify and measure. The most important things in our world are difficult to understand and often intangible.\nThe economy, climate change, and the war in Syria are all massively important things, but because they\\u2019re complicated and difficult to understand, we tend to ignore them.

The earliest celebrities were people like politicians, explorers, and artists who were admired for their work. But the earliest example of outside attention paid to celebrities is gossip magazines.\nThe first gossip magazine, Town Topics, was published in New York City in the 1890s. Since then, the media has played an enormous role in shaping who we spend our time thinking about and who we build into celebrities.\nThe rise of the internet created a whole new world of celebrity obsession, but social media has taken things even further.

A politician can post about an important issue and maybe a few thousand people will hear about it. The thing is, though, that politicians have a lot more power. They can pass laws, they can fund new programs, they are in charge of entire countries. But they don\\u2019t have the same level of influence as musicians.\nMusicians don\\u2019t just have influence over the issues they talk about. They have influence over how we see the world. When a musician posts a picture of their cat, it gets just as many likes as a post about something they think is important.\nThe most important people in the world are the people who have the most influence on your life.
