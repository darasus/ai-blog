summary: Programs written in Go will typically be compiled to several times
  faster than programs written in languages like C/C++ or Fortran. Go is
  particularly suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as image
  processing, machine learning, and data analysis. The Go language is easy to
  read and maintain, which is ideal for collaborative projects. Go has built-in
  support for comments, error handling and flow control are among the language
  features that will make programming in Go an even better experience. The
  language is an excellent choice for any project that requires scientific
  computing.
intro: >-
  The Go programming language has gained popularity in the software
  engineering community over the last couple of years. Many developers have
  taken a liking to Go because of its simplicity, readability, and faster
  compilation time. Other benefits include having little to no runtime overhead,
  being memory safe by default, and being able to compile Go code as standalone
  binaries or as packages (called packages in Go). 

  Go is an ideal language for scientific computing due to its performance, ease of use, and standard libraries. This blog will outline reasons you should consider using Go for your next project that involves heavy scientific computing.

## Performance

Go is fast. Programs written in Go will typically be compiled to several times faster than equivalent programs written in languages like C/C++ or Fortran. Go achieves this speed-up by using a lightweight virtual machine (VM) that avoids addressing the complexities of a general-purpose CPU.
This means that Go is particularly suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as image processing, machine learning, and data analysis.

## Ease of use

Go is a great language if you are new to coding or if you are trying to switch from another language such as C/C++. One of the reasons why Go is great for beginners is because the syntax is much simpler than other languages. The Go language is also easy to read and maintain, which is ideal for collaborative projects.

## Standard Go libraries for scientific computing

For scientific computing, Go’s standard library includes packages such as image, io/ioutil, io/ioutil, math, and net. These packages allow Go programs to easily manipulate images, read/write files, do mathematical operations, and interact with the internet.
The image package is a robust package for image processing. It is able to read many common image formats, such as JPEG and PNG, and write them to different file formats, such as GIF and TIFF.
The math package provides many useful operations such as discrete Fourier transforms (DFT), basic statistical calculations, and random number generation.
The net package is useful for network programming and includes functionality to connect to remote servers, download files from the internet, and send emails.
The io/ioutil package is useful for reading from and writing to files. This package is particularly helpful for reading/writing text files and reading/writing data from Excel or Google Sheets.

## Language Feature Benefit For Scientific Computing

If you are a programmer who has previously worked in C, C++, or Fortran, you’ll be at home with Go. However, there are some language features that will make programming in Go an even better experience.
- Error handling and flow control are excellent. Go’s error handling is one of the best features of the language. Go forces you to explicitly declare all possible errors in your code. This helps programmers catch errors earlier and makes the code easier to read and maintain.
- Go has great support for concurrent programming. If you are working on a project that requires creating multithreaded programs, you will be happy to know that Go excels at this.
- Go supports packages and has an excellent package management system. This allows you to organize your code into packages, which are like folders that contain related code. Packages are helpful if you are working on a collaborative project with other Go programmers.
- Go has excellent standard library support. The standard library contains many useful functions for common programming tasks.

## Go Code is Easy to Read and Maintain

The best programming languages are readable, concise, and maintainable. Complicated code is difficult to read, understand, and update. Go’s simplicity makes it easy to read and maintain.
- Go code uses very little curly brackets. This makes reading and understanding code much simpler.
- Semicolons are not required. This makes it easy to write code without having to worry about forgetting a semicolon.
- Go has great support for code formatting. This means that you can write code in any format that you find easier to read. The Go compiler will ignore the formatting of the code.
- Go has built-in support for comments. Comments are helpful for explaining what the code is doing. This makes it easier to understand how the code works.

## Go Supports Native C/C++ Code

One of the biggest advantages to Go is that you can use existing C/C++ code within a Go program. For example, you can use C/C++ functions as part of your Go program or create a C/C++ library and import it into your Go code.
This allows you to take advantage of existing C/C++ libraries and code. This is particularly helpful for scientific programming where many of the libraries are written in C/C++.
- You can also mix C and Go code within the same program. This allows you to write code in the language that is most suitable for the task. For example, you may want to write your user interface in Go, but use C to write your image processing code.
- Go provides some functionality that is not provided in C/C++ such as automatic garbage collection, memory safety, and built-in concurrency.

## Conclusion

The Go programming language is an excellent choice for any project that requires scientific computing. With its fast compilation times and lightweight VM, Go is well suited for computationally intensive tasks. It’s easy to read and maintain code and has built-in support for C/C++ code. Go is also great for beginners, has excellent error handling, and has a strong standard library for scientific computing.
