summary: The investment in blockchain technology can be greater than other
  technologies when a business first implements it, but it’s not necessarily
  more expensive in the long run. In fact, blockchain can be cheaper than many
  centralized systems because there are no ongoing maintenance costs. A few
  seconds’ delay in getting that information could be critical and result in
  serious consequences. The data in a blockchain database is replicated and
  spread out over the network. However, a hacker is only able to access the data
  on one node on the blockchain, however, if the hacker gains access to 50% of
  the nodes, he/she can access 50% more of the data.
intro: >-
  The blockchain is a game-changing technology that has the potential to
  transform businesses and industries. So, it’s no wonder that startups are
  eager to leverage this technology and its various uses to their benefit. 

  Moreover, with the growing number of emerging blockchain-based projects and ICOs, it’s evident that the adoption of this technology will only continue to grow in the foreseeable future. 

  However, for many startups, implementing blockchain into new or existing products can seem like a challenging task. As such, there are a lot of myths about the use of blockchain for businesses that we often hear; either because they are believed to be true by many or because these theories make sense on the surface. But do they stand up to scrutiny? Let’s take a look at some of these popular misconceptions surrounding blockchain technology and see if there’s any validity to them:

## Blockchain is too expensive to implement.

While it’s true that the investment in blockchain technology can be greater than other technologies when a business first implements it, blockchain is not necessarily more expensive in the long run. In fact, blockchain can be cheaper than many centralized systems in the long run because there are no ongoing maintenance costs. With a centralized system, you must pay a licensing fee for each location where the system is installed. When it comes to blockchain, however, you only need to make one investment to install the system at each location where it’s needed.

Another aspect to consider is that blockchain is likely to become less expensive over time because we’re seeing a trend in which new blockchain startups are emerging with lower cost structures than those of their predecessors. This is because blockchain startups that are new to the scene are starting with a clean slate and can benefit from lessons learned by previous projects.

## Blockchain is slow and cannot handle big data.

Generally speaking, blockchain is not slow. However, one must consider the type of blockchain that is being used. For instance, when financial transactions are conducted on a blockchain, speed is not critical. In fact, the transactions could take days or weeks to settle because the parties involved are looking for accuracy and assurance that the settlements are accurate. This is why blockchain is often used for financial transactions.
This is also true for other types of transactions that require a certain auditing or verification process. However, speed can be an issue when a blockchain is used for a type of data that is time sensitive.
For example, if a blockchain is used for supply chain management that includes monitoring the real-time location of products and raw materials, a minute-long delay in getting that information would be too long. The same is true when a blockchain is used to track medical procedures and important test results. In either case, a few seconds’ delay in getting that information could be critical and result in serious consequences.

## Blockchain requires a lot of time to set up.

Again, this depends on the type of blockchain that you’re setting up. However, a blockchain does not have to be as complicated as people think. There are a few basic components of a blockchain that need to be set up. These include the consensus mechanism, the network, the nodes, and the wallets.
Before you set up a blockchain, it’s important to understand what exactly it is that you’re trying to accomplish and how blockchain can help. At the same time, it’s important to pick the type of blockchain that’s best suited to your business.
Once you’ve done this and know how you want to set up your blockchain, it’s important to find a blockchain development company that has blockchain experts on staff who can help with the setup and ensure that it’s done correctly.

## The blockchain is a fully secure database.

First, it’s important to understand that a blockchain is not a database. Rather, it’s a technology that’s often used to build databases. When people say that the blockchain is a fully secure database, what they mean is that the data that’s stored in the blockchain is secured and is difficult to hack because it’s decentralized.
However, at the same time, it’s important to understand that no database is fully secure. What you can say is that a blockchain database is more secure than regular databases.
This is because the data in a blockchain database is replicated and spread out over the network. If someone gains unauthorized access to one or more nodes on the network, that person would only have partial access to the database and wouldn’t be able to change or delete the data.

## Blockchain cannot be hacked.

While it’s true that a fully secure database is difficult to hack, nothing is impossible. At the same time, while other databases are centralized, blockchain databases are decentralized. This means that the data is replicated and spread out over the nodes on the network.
Therefore, it’s practically impossible to hack the entire network at once. However, it’s important to remember that blockchain is not entirely hack-proof. It’s more accurate to say that the blockchain is more secure than regular databases.
If a hacker is trying to hack one node on the blockchain, he/she is only able to access the data on that one node. However, if the hacker gains access to 50% or more of the nodes, he/she can access the data on all of the nodes.
Therefore, it’s essential to choose the type of blockchain that’s best suited to your business and to ensure that only authorized people are given access to the nodes.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, there’s no denying that blockchain technology is fascinating. It’s a revolutionary technology that’s here to stay and will continue to reshape the way businesses operate by enabling them to transact in a decentralized manner.
And while there are many myths surrounding blockchain technology, it’s important to remember that there are always two sides to every story.
When it comes to blockchain, there are many benefits to this technology. For one thing, it’s secure and accurate. At the same time, it’s also cheaper to implement than many other types of technology.
Furthermore, blockchain is scalable and can be used in a variety of industries. It can also be used to create new business models and transform the way we do things.
