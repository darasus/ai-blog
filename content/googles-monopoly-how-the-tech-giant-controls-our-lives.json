It was a breakthrough at the time because it allowed people to search for information on the internet instead of having to navigate to a bunch of individual websites.

It\\u2019s very easy to start clicking around on shopping websites when you\\u2019re feeling down, and this can quickly turn into impulse shopping.\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re feeling pretty low one night.

That means if you buy a new pair of running shoes, you\\u2019re likely to see ads for other running shoes in the Google Shopping section of your favorite websites.\nThis is called \\u201Cretargeting,\\u201D and it\\u2019s a powerful marketing tool. Retargeting ads are designed to show you products that you\\u2019ve previously shown an interest in.\nBy tracking your shopping habits, Google can determine your preferences and show you ads for products that you might buy \\u2014 even if you don\\u2019t actually click on the ads.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google knows what you read.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Google\\u2019s reach goes far beyond the products you buy online.

The world is on the cusp of an exciting new era in wireless technology, as the rollout of fifth generation (5G) cellular networks begins across the globe.\nEven though 4G LTE coverage is widespread and newer 5G networks aren\\u2019t quite ready for large-scale implementation just yet, carriers around the world are already testing out pre-Release 15 5G network services. Several national operators have already begun deploying their 5G network infrastructure, while others are set to follow suit in the coming months. The race is on to lead the way in this cutting-edge technology and reap the benefits that come with it. It\\u2019s a fast-moving space, so here\\u2019s everything you need to know about 5G and when you can expect it to launch where you live.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
