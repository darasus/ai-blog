The show\\u2019s entire purpose is to capture every moment of his life for the entertainment of an audience watching from outside the town.\nIn real life, Google has become something similar: It\\u2019s a company whose purpose is to capture every moment of our lives for the entertainment of an audience watching from outside our world.\nYou might not know this if you live, work, and play exclusively online \\u2014 as many people now do \\u2014 but Google realizes more about you than any other company on earth.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This information serves many purposes, but the primary purpose is to allow advertisers to target specific users with highly effective ads. The more information Google has about us, the better it can tailor ads to our specific interests.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Google\\u2019s first product was an online search engine. It was a breakthrough at the time because it allowed people to search for information on the internet instead of having to navigate to a bunch of individual websites. But Google soon realized that there was more money to be made in the ads tied to search results than in the search engine itself. So it began sharing those ads with other websites. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google knows when we\\u2019re most vulnerable.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the more disturbing facts about Google is that it knows when we\\u2019re most vulnerable to buying something. This may sound like an overstatement, but it\\u2019s actually true: Google has figured out the exact moments when we\\u2019re most vulnerable to making purchases \\u2014 and those moments don\\u2019t always coincide with rational decision-making.\nThe most common example cited in this case is when people are feeling depressed. It\\u2019s very easy to start clicking around on shopping websites when you\\u2019re feeling down, and this can quickly turn into impulse shopping.\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re feeling pretty low one night. Maybe you got dumped by your boyfriend, or maybe you\\u2019re dealing with a run of bad luck. You\\u2019re alone in your apartment, and you\\u2019re feeling pretty blue. At that moment, Google knows that you\\u2019re more likely to click on ads for expensive products than you would be when you\\u2019re feeling happy and upbeat.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google is watching everything you buy.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Google is more than just an advertising company: It also has a robust e-commerce platform that allows people to sell products. The company\\u2019s e-commerce activities are powered by a service called Google Shopping that is, in many ways, more valuable than Google\\u2019s regular search engine.\nThis is because Google Shopping shows ads based on your recent purchases. That means if you buy a new pair of running shoes, you\\u2019re likely to see ads for other running shoes in the Google Shopping section of your favorite websites.\nThis is called \\u201Cretargeting,\\u201D and it\\u2019s a powerful marketing tool. Retargeting ads are designed to show you products that you\\u2019ve previously shown an interest in.\nBy tracking your shopping habits, Google can determine your preferences and show you ads for products that you might buy \\u2014 even if you don\\u2019t actually click on the ads.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google knows what you read.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Google\\u2019s reach goes far beyond the products you buy online. It encompasses everything you read online, too.\nGoogle\\u2019s web crawler, an automated program that surfs the internet to figure out what pages are most relevant for particular searches, has a direct line to everything you read online. That means that when you read an article, Google knows about it.`),mdx(\"p\",null,`Your browser automatically sends information about the pages you visit to Google, and that includes articles. Google includes that information in its database as part of its effort to show you results that you\\u2019ll find most relevant for any given search.\nBy reading articles, you\\u2019re feeding Google data that allows the company to better tailor its results to your needs.\nThe best example of this is Google\\u2019s timeline feature. If you click on the \\u201CExplore\\u201D tab at the top of the Google search page, you\\u2019ll be shown a timeline of events related to your search. You may see a timeline of related news stories or biographies of people who are relevant to your search.\nThis timeline is filled with information that you\\u2019ve read in the past \\u2014 whether you realized it or not.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google is keeping track of your travels.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`If you use Google Maps to track your daily travels, you may not realize that those movements are being recorded.\nWhen you use Google Maps to track your daily travels, the program keeps a record of your movements and places them on a map. This is most likely used for traffic reporting, but it also means that Google has a map with your travels on it.\nThis data can then be used by other companies for a variety of purposes.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google has access to your conversations.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Let\\u2019s say you use Google\\u2019s voice assistant to make a phone call. That call is recorded, and Google keeps the recording. Now, let\\u2019s say you use Google\\u2019s voice assistant to send a text message to one of your friends. That, too, is recorded and kept by Google.\nThat\\u2019s right: Google has access to every conversation you have with a person \\u2014 and it knows exactly who you\\u2019re talking to.\nThis information is used by Google to improve its voice search, its translation services, and other products.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google can see where you live and where you work.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Google knows where you\\u2019re going and where you\\u2019ve been, but it can also see where you live and where you work.\nGoogle Maps allows you to mark where you live and work. When you do this, your home and workplace are added to a database of Google map locations.\nIf you use Google\\u2019s Street View feature, you can also see images of your home and workplace.\nYou may not realize it, but Google has a record of your home and where you work.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Is it possible to quit Google?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`You can certainly reduce your Google dependence, but it\\u2019s nearly impossible to completely \\u201Cquit\\u201D the company. One way to reduce your reliance on Google is to use alternative services as much as possible.\nIf you can avoid using Google\\u2019s services, you\\u2019re less reliant on Google\\u2019s information. This means you should use Bing instead of Google for web searches, Yahoo for email, and so on.\nYou should also avoid using Gmail as your primary email account and switch to a service like RiseUp or Tutanota that is not connected to Google.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Even if you do everything you can to minimize your reliance on Google, you won\\u2019t be able to completely escape the company\\u2019s grasp.

In fact, it has become so large that it is difficult to escape, even if you try. Google has a hand in everything from news to communications to travel, and while some of these services are useful, they can also be incredibly invasive.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is important to remember that, whenever you use Google, you are putting a lot of yourself into the hands of a large, powerful company.\nThe good news is that Google is not just any company: It\\u2019s one of the most innovative and powerful companies the world has ever seen.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
