It was a breakthrough at the time because it allowed people to search for information on the internet instead of having to navigate to a bunch of individual websites.

So it began sharing those ads with other websites. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google knows when we\\u2019re most vulnerable.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the more disturbing facts about Google is that it knows when we\\u2019re most vulnerable to buying something.

It\\u2019s very easy to start clicking around on shopping websites when you\\u2019re feeling down, and this can quickly turn into impulse shopping.\nLet\\u2019s say you\\u2019re feeling pretty low one night. Maybe you got dumped by your boyfriend, or maybe you\\u2019re dealing with a run of bad luck. You\\u2019re alone in your apartment, and you\\u2019re feeling pretty blue.

The company\\u2019s e-commerce activities are powered by a service called Google Shopping that is, in many ways, more valuable than Google\\u2019s regular search engine.\nThis is because Google Shopping shows ads based on your recent purchases. That means if you buy a new pair of running shoes, you\\u2019re likely to see ads for other running shoes in the Google Shopping section of your favorite websites.\nThis is called \\u201Cretargeting,\\u201D and it\\u2019s a powerful marketing tool. Retargeting ads are designed to show you products that you\\u2019ve previously shown an interest in.\nBy tracking your shopping habits, Google can determine your preferences and show you ads for products that you might buy \\u2014 even if you don\\u2019t actually click on the ads.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Google knows what you read.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Google\\u2019s reach goes far beyond the products you buy online.

If you click on the \\u201CExplore\\u201D tab at the top of the Google search page, you\\u2019ll be shown a timeline of events related to your search.
