  "content": "## What to Look for When Buying a New Smartphone\n\nBefore you decide on which smartphone to buy, it’s important to think about your needs and how you’ll be using the phone. Here are some key things to keep in mind when buying a new smartphone:\n\n- The Operating System: There are two major operating systems that smartphones run on: Android and iPhone. While the two are very different, they both have their strengths and weaknesses. If you’re buying an iPhone, you’ll need to make sure it’s the latest model (currently the XS or XS Max). If you’re buying an Android, make sure you choose a model running Android 8 Oreo or later.\n\n- The Size: In terms of screen size, there are two main types: the standard (or “regular”) size, and the “plus” size. The standard size is around 4.5-inches, while the plus size is around 6-inches. Generally, the plus size is only found on the high-end phones, though there are budget options out there. If you have small hands, it might be worth considering the standard size.\n\n- Battery Life: Smartphones generally run around 8-9 hours on a full charge, but there are differences between models. It’s worth noting that some phones have a fast-charging feature that can reduce charging times by up to 50%.\n\n- Camera Quality: The camera is one of the most important features in a smartphone. Generally, the higher the price, the better the camera quality.\n\n- Storage: Most smartphones come with 32 GB of storage, but there are some cheaper options with 16 GB of storage. If you take lots of photos and videos or store a lot of music on your smartphone, you’ll need to consider how much storage you’ll need.\n\n## How to Choose the Right Brands\n\nThere are loads of different brands when it comes to smartphones. When you’re looking for the best one, you’ll want to make sure it meets the following criteria:\n\n- Great Design: The design is arguably the most important feature. You don’t want a phone that looks out of date and old-fashioned! You want a phone that matches your tastes in terms of color, design, and aesthetic.\n\n- Great Features: You’ll want to make sure the phone you choose includes all of the features you need. If you are a frequent traveler, you’ll want a phone with great battery life and a built-in compass. If you like to take lots of photos, you’ll want a phone with a high-quality camera.\n\n- Great Brand Reputation: Don’t just go for the brand with the highest price tag. You want to find a brand that has a strong reputation, and that has been making quality phones for many years.\n\n## Best Android Smartphones Under $200\n\nFor the best Android smartphones under $200, we recommend the Samsung Galaxy S9, the LG G7 ThinQ, and the Moto G6.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S9 is a great Android phone with a large 6.2-inch screen, excellent camera and image quality, and a very intuitive user interface.\nThe LG G7 ThinQ is another top-notch Android phone with a large screen, excellent camera, and a very stylish design.
