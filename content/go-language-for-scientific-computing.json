They can also master complex code and find solutions to difficult technical problems. But beyond that, great coders bring something else to the table: they have a unique combination of traits that make them productive and effective programmers. The best coders have a set of common habits that allow them to thrive in an often stressful environment. There are many pressures on software engineers, from tight deadlines to the constant demand for new features. Great coders are able to thrive in this pressure-filled environment because of their ability to manage stress, focus intently, and think creatively about the problem at hand.
