In simple terms, we want to cut down the time between a code being written and it being ready for production.\nWe often see developers writing messy codes that are difficult to read or understand. The same goes for Ops engineers who find it challenging to debug different errors in production. This is where the Go language comes into play.\nSince its launch in 2009, Go has gained immense popularity among software developers across the globe, who have even dubbed it \\u201Cthe new old thing\\u201D. It was developed by Google as an alternative to other languages that were slow and memory-intensive at that time.\nIf you are a developer looking forward to implement DevOps with the help of Go, this article is for you!
