Go is particularly suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as image processing, machine learning, and data analysis. The Go language is easy to read and maintain, which is ideal for collaborative projects. Go has built-in support for comments, error handling and flow control are among the language features that will make programming in Go an even better experience.
