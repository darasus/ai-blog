  "summary": "The end of the world is a harsh but beautiful metaphor for the destruction of a person’s ego and the rebuilding of their psychological self. With the previous social constructs and paradigms broken, characters are left to rebuild who they are and how they see the world around them.

  "intro": "For some, the world will end in fire. For others, it will end in ice. And for others still, it will just fizzle out like a can of cheap fuel on an old race car. But no matter how you look at it, the apocalypse is coming. The only question is when?\nThis was the sentiment that drove much of popular culture throughout the 70s and 80s. Films like “Mad Max” and “The Road Warrior” were cautionary tales about the future of mankind brought on by a series of devastating natural and man-made disasters; \"Mad Max\" being set during a prolonged drought, and \"The Road Warrior\" taking place after a catastrophic failure of an oil refinery leads to widespread pollution and destruction as well as a shortage of gasoline (which is what inspired the term “Road Warrior”).\nIn these movies, there are also factions that have arisen to take advantage of these new conditions: In \"Mad Max\", we see gangs whose primary function is to steal fuel from other scavenger tribes; In \"The Road Warrior\", we see roving bands that are essentially highwaymen that prey upon small towns using their road-warrior combat skillset; And in both movies we see heroes who fight against evil not because they want to be evil but because they are good people trying to save those they love in terrible times.\nThese subtexts have been explored time and time again throughout history through literature such as The Bible",
  "content": "## The Apocalypse as a lens to examine the human condition\n\nPost-apocalyptic fiction has been used for centuries to examine the human condition in a vacuum. The end of the world is a harsh but beautiful metaphor for the destruction of a person’s ego, the destruction of their world, and the rebuilding of their psychological self.\nThe world as we know it is fully explored in \"Mad Max\", and then that world is destroyed in \"The Road Warrior\". With the previous social constructs and paradigms broken, characters are left to rebuild who they are and how they see the world around them.\nThis is seen in all of the characters throughout the two movies, but the clearest example is Max himself. In the first movie, he is a lone wolf who has a clear distaste for authority figures. Twisted steel and death have made him into an outcast. In the second movie, he’s married to a woman who is his queen. He’s also become a man of faith and an inspiring leader who, at the end of the movie, gives his wife the reigns of power and then rides off into the sunset to find more adventure and to prove that there are no limits to the human spirit. Max’s journey is the most clear-cut example of this, but all of the characters in these movies are products of the apocalypse.\n\n## The Road Warrior as an allegory for Capitalism\n\nThe world of \"Mad Max\" is one of scarcity: People fight over fuel, water, and arable farmland in an effort to survive. It is a world of warlords, gangs, and rogue police who have taken the law into their hands.\nThe world of \"The Road Warrior\" is one of abundance: People fight over who gets to consume the fuel, water, and arable farmland that they created. It is a world of businessmen, gangs, and governments who have taken the law into their hands.\nThis dichotomy between scarcity and abundance is a perfect metaphor for capitalism. In a capitalist society, the idea is that there is a limited supply of goods, but everyone has a right to consume those goods.\nIn \"Mad Max\", the fuel is not abundant enough for everyone, so people fight over it. This is a key point because it assumes a zero-sum game where one side loses and one side gains. In a capitalist society, companies also fight over limited resources, but the difference is that both sides win. A company that grows at the expense of its competitors is not taking anything away from them, it is giving them a product or service that they want and need.\n\n## The Road Warrior as an allegory for Environmentalism\n\nEnvironmentalism is the idea that nature is a delicate ecosystem that we should protect and care for. It is also the idea that we live in a delicate ecosystem that we should protect and care for.\nThe world in \"The Road Warrior\" becomes essentially uninhabitable thanks to industrial pollution. The air is toxic, the water is poisonous, and the soil is unable to sustain life.\nThis is a beautiful metaphor for the effects of industrialization on our ecosystem. Our atmosphere is very polluted, and there is a rising concern over the state of our oceans. This is not a fringe belief; It is something that almost everyone accepts as fact.\n\n## The Road Warrior as an Allegory for Feminism\n\nThe first \"Mad Max\" is a very male-centric movie with very few female characters. The second \"Mad Max\" is a very male-centric movie with very few female characters. \"Fury Road\", on the other hand, is a thoroughly feminist movie with lots of female representation.\nThis is not to say that the first two \"Mad Max\" movies are sexist, but they certainly don’t break any molds. The first two are traditional films made in a very traditional way, whereas \"Fury Road\" is a very nontraditional film made in a very nontraditional way.\nThe woman in the first two \"Mad Max\" movies are, like women in most films, important to the plot but not the driving force. The women in \"Fury Road\" are the driving force of the plot.\nThis mirrors how feminism works in the real world; Women are not just objects of sexual desire, but they are powerful people who have the ability to change the world.\n\n## Fury Road’s Misogyny and its examination of toxic masculinity\n\nOne of the most consistent criticisms of \"Fury Road\" is that it is misogynistic. People say that it reduces all of its female characters to either sex slaves, wives, or stereotypes of women.\nThis is not a surprising claim to make given the nature of the film, but it is a disappointing one given the fact that \"Fury Road\" is a brutal and honest assessment of the horrors of toxic masculinity.\nToxic masculinity is the idea that a man is only as good as the amount of sex he’s had, the number of people he’s murdered, or the amount of women he’s reduced to a submissive role.\nIn \"Fury Road\", we see toxic masculinity in the form of Immortan Joe and his War Boys. Immortan Joe has built a society where the only people who matter are his sons who will one day take his place, his wives who do his bidding, and his soldiers who protect his land and women.\nThe War Boys have been raised to believe that pain and death are their only defining characteristics. They have no names; They are only known by their vehicle and the part of their body that they’ve transformed into a weapon. They have been told that all other ways of living are weakness, and they have been conditioned to think that they deserve only death.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\"Fury Road\" is a stunning masterpiece of cinema. It is a shining example of what film can be: an immersive experience that engages all of your senses and leaves you with a lasting impact. It is a brutal, honest examination of the human condition and is a clear example of how film can be a better teacher than any classroom.\n\nLuckily for us, the apocalypse seems as though it will occur much farther into the future than it did in the past. We are fortunate enough to live in a time where we have the opportunity and the ability to change the world. We have a powerful medium at our fingertips, and we should use it to its full potential."
