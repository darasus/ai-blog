In the second movie, he\\u2019s married to a woman who is his queen.

In a capitalist society, the idea is that there is a limited supply of goods, but everyone has a right to consume those goods.\nIn \"Mad Max\", the fuel is not abundant enough for everyone, so people fight over it. This is a key point because it assumes a zero-sum game where one side loses and one side gains. In a capitalist society, companies also fight over limited resources, but the difference is that both sides win.

As a result, he devises a plan to create publicity for his production of The Birdman by playing both roles in the same play and switching back and forth in front of an audience. He also moves into the derelict theater with his daughter where he will perform as part of his preparations on getting back into shape.\nIn exploring these themes of egotism and desperation in a celebrity-obsessed world, \"Birdman\" is an interesting exploration of what it means to be famous and why we allow others to have such power over us.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is his story.\nTuring was a brilliant man with many interests that went beyond mathematics and computer science: chess, cryptography, music theory and programming computers to sing are just some examples. This diverse background helped him crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II at Bletchley Park (which has been nicknamed \"Codebreaking Castle\"). This saved countless lives and accelerated the end of the war by two years. After the war ended in 1945, Turing continued working as an cryptanalyst for a few more years before turning his attention to other interests \\u2013- and it is these interests that led to his arrest and untimely death at age 41.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
