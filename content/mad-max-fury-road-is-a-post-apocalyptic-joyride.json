With the previous social constructs and paradigms broken, characters are left to rebuild who they are and how they see the world around them.\nThis is seen in all of the characters throughout the two movies, but the clearest example is Max himself. In the first movie, he is a lone wolf who has a clear distaste for authority figures. Twisted steel and death have made him into an outcast. In the second movie, he\\u2019s married to a woman who is his queen. He\\u2019s also become a man of faith and an inspiring leader who, at the end of the movie, gives his wife the reigns of power and then rides off into the sunset to find more adventure and to prove that there are no limits to the human spirit.

It is a world of businessmen, gangs, and governments who have taken the law into their hands.\nThis dichotomy between scarcity and abundance is a perfect metaphor for capitalism. In a capitalist society, the idea is that there is a limited supply of goods, but everyone has a right to consume those goods.\nIn \"Mad Max\", the fuel is not abundant enough for everyone, so people fight over it. This is a key point because it assumes a zero-sum game where one side loses and one side gains. In a capitalist society, companies also fight over limited resources, but the difference is that both sides win.

Immortan Joe has built a society where the only people who matter are his sons who will one day take his place, his wives who do his bidding, and his soldiers who protect his land and women.\nThe War Boys have been raised to believe that pain and death are their only defining characteristics.
