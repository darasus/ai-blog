With the previous social constructs and paradigms broken, characters are left to rebuild who they are and how they see the world around them.\nThis is seen in all of the characters throughout the two movies, but the clearest example is Max himself. In the first movie, he is a lone wolf who has a clear distaste for authority figures. Twisted steel and death have made him into an outcast. In the second movie, he\\u2019s married to a woman who is his queen. He\\u2019s also become a man of faith and an inspiring leader who, at the end of the movie, gives his wife the reigns of power and then rides off into the sunset to find more adventure and to prove that there are no limits to the human spirit.

It is a world of businessmen, gangs, and governments who have taken the law into their hands.\nThis dichotomy between scarcity and abundance is a perfect metaphor for capitalism. In a capitalist society, the idea is that there is a limited supply of goods, but everyone has a right to consume those goods.\nIn \"Mad Max\", the fuel is not abundant enough for everyone, so people fight over it. This is a key point because it assumes a zero-sum game where one side loses and one side gains. In a capitalist society, companies also fight over limited resources, but the difference is that both sides win.

The first two are traditional films made in a very traditional way, whereas \"Fury Road\" is a very nontraditional film made in a very nontraditional way.\nThe woman in the first two \"Mad Max\" movies are, like women in most films, important to the plot but not the driving force.

Immortan Joe has built a society where the only people who matter are his sons who will one day take his place, his wives who do his bidding, and his soldiers who protect his land and women.\nThe War Boys have been raised to believe that pain and death are their only defining characteristics.

There are no heroes in this period\\u2014just two paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a stark world where there are no easy answers.\nThe 1980s was a peak moment in that tension\\u2014from Reagan\\u2019s \\u201Cevil empire\\u201D speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe. In brief: It was not a good time to be alive if you believed in world peace. Thankfully, Hollywood had spies as intrepid as Tom Hanks ready to leap into action against those dastardly Soviet Commies whenever they needed someone captured or rescued from behind enemy lines.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives. The result is something like a documentary on human development \\u2014 funny, sad, awkward, and everything in between \\u2014 presented through the lens of an intimate cinematic experience.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
