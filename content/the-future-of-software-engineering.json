A typical software engineering program will cover everything from computer science fundamentals to business topics like marketing, management and operations. As a result, a software engineering degree will provide you with a more well-rounded education than a computer science degree. It will prepare you to work in almost any industry and give you a stronger foundation for managing and leading teams. However, it will also take you longer to complete a software engineering degree than a computer science degree.

This means that the two degrees differ in the courses they cover.
