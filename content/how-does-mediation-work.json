Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have.

Fussing and fuming won\\u2019t make them any less likely to follow you anywhere, or to notice that bag of chips you just carelessly threw on the table. Dogs are dogs, which means they will follow your slightest lead and chip in with their two cents at every opportunity. Sadly, this also means that it\\u2019s not uncommon for dogs to get into things they shouldn\\u2019t. You like peace and quiet? Not so much when there\\u2019s a dog around. You like keeping your things? Good luck with that.\nBut luckily, with some bit of training and persistence, you can teach your pup exactly what\\u2019s off limits and exactly where to leave it instead. Best of all, all these tricks take very little time and effort on our part. It doesn\\u2019t have to be hard! Let\\u2019s check out how!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
