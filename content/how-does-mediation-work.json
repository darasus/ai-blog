It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have.

Putting your dog in a boarding facility or kennel isn\\u2019t an easy decision for most pet owners, especially if you have a sensitive breed (i.e., lots of barking = unhappy dogs). So how can you get your pup ready to be on their own? It\\u2019s not as simple as locking them in a closet for a few hours once or twice and then expecting them to be cool with it. Dogs don\\u2019t think like people; they don\\u2019t understand symbolic actions like turning off the light as meaning that you won\\u2019t be coming back home tonight. They have instinctual fear responses that need to be addressed specifically with training and care before leaving them alone.'))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

And when you\\u2019re grappling with pandemic disease and a global outbreak, time spent at work has a whole different set of implications.\nPandemic flu strains have decimated human populations since the first recorded pandemic in 541 AD. Over the centuries, outbreaks have been frequent enough to instill fear in even the most stoic among us.\nToday we face another pandemic threat with the potential to be even more devastating than those which came before it. A highly virulent strain of influenza A virus known as influenza pandemia has begun spreading rapidly throughout much of the world.\nIn many ways, today\\u2019s workplace is very different from that of a century ago.
