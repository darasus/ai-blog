Python is a versatile language that you can use on the backend, frontend, or full stack of a web application. It's also popular for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and creating desktop GUI applications. 

On the backend, Python is often used for scripting web applications, automating system tasks, and powering web APIs. Python's popularity as a backend language is due in part to its robust libraries and frameworks. For example, Django is a widely used Python web framework that makes it easy to build complex web applications quickly. 

On the frontend, Python can be used to create custom widgets and GUI applications. Python's Tkinter library is a popular choice for creating desktop GUI applications. 

Python can also be used for full stack web development, which means working with both the frontend and backend of a web application. Full stack Python web development is popular because Python offers an easy way to develop complex web applications quickly.
