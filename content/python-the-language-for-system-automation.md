summary: Python is a general-purpose programming language that is used for many
  different types of applications, such as web development, data science, and
  automation. Python’s use for system automation can be traced back to its
  syntax, which is simpler than other languages such as Java or C. This
  simplicity makes it easier for beginners to learn and gain experience in the
  field of automation.Python also comes with a built-in package manager that
  allows you to install third-party Python packages. This blog has explored how
  Python is used to automate tasks and how it can benefit businesses.
intro: Automating tasks is a way of making your life easier. Imagine this, you
  need to run a report every day and it takes 5 minutes each time. You could
  either set an alarm and rush back to the desk in 5 minutes or create a script
  to automate this process. The latter leaves more time for you to focus on more
  important things. What if you could automate even the simplest tasks? Wouldn’t
  it free up your time for better things? That’s where Python comes into play.
  As an automation scripting language, it can help you automate even the
  simplest of tasks and free up more time for work that matters. Automation
  helps businesses in many ways. It saves time, increases efficiency and
  decreases costs by eliminating manual processes. In this blog, we will explore
  why Python is such a popular programming language for system automation and
  how it can be used to automate simple repetitive tasks in your organization.
