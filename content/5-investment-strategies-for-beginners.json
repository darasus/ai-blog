Diversification is the strategy of spreading an investment across multiple asset classes, industries, and company sizes to reduce risk. A good way to think about diversification is to imagine you have a savings account with a particular bank. If that bank goes out of business, you\\u2019ll lose all of your money. Whereas if you have money in multiple banks, you\\u2019ll have a much better chance of not losing everything. The same applies with investing in different types of assets. If you put all of your eggs in one basket, such as investing in one single company or industry, you\\u2019re risking it all if that company goes out of business or that industry experiences a downswing.

When you invest in a company\\u2019s stock, you\\u2019re buying a share of that company. This means that if that company is doing well, your investment will also increase in value. However, if the company is struggling, you\\u2019ll likely see your investment decrease in value. The other main type of investment is debt. Debt investments are safer investments that are not directly tied to the success of a company.

It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times\\u2014not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.

If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then.
