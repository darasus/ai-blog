Diversification is the strategy of spreading an investment across multiple asset classes, industries, and company sizes to reduce risk. A good way to think about diversification is to imagine you have a savings account with a particular bank. If that bank goes out of business, you\\u2019ll lose all of your money. Whereas if you have money in multiple banks, you\\u2019ll have a much better chance of not losing everything. The same applies with investing in different types of assets. If you put all of your eggs in one basket, such as investing in one single company or industry, you\\u2019re risking it all if that company goes out of business or that industry experiences a downswing. Diversification helps you spread the risk and protects your overall portfolio.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Get to know the difference between equity and debt investments\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You may have noticed the word \\u2018equity\\u2019 popping up when you\\u2019re reading up on different investment types. Equity investments (also known as stocks) are a riskier type of investment that grows as the company behind the stock grows. When you invest in a company\\u2019s stock, you\\u2019re buying a share of that company. This means that if that company is doing well, your investment will also increase in value. However, if the company is struggling, you\\u2019ll likely see your investment decrease in value. The other main type of investment is debt. Debt investments are safer investments that are not directly tied to the success of a company. If the company does well, you may see a small increase in your investment, but it\\u2019s not guaranteed. Debt investments are great for financial stability and offer a reliable return, but usually come with lower investment returns than equity investments.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The power of compound interest\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Compound interest is one of the most powerful and important concepts in finance. Basically, it means that as interest accumulates on your initial investment, it earns even more interest itself. Think of it as your interest earning interest. Compound interest is an extremely helpful tool for showing the growth potential of your investments and is one of the key advantages of investing early. If you begin investing in your 20s, compound interest has a ton of time to work its magic and make your investment grow much bigger than if you begin in your 30s or 40s.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Mutual funds are a great starting point for beginners\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mutual funds are a great way to get started investing if you\\u2019re a beginner.
