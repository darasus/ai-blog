## What is Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin Cash is a type of digital currency called a cryptocurrency. The system is decentralized and uses a “proof of work” algorithm that validates transactions by solving complex mathematical problems. The currency itself is not owned or controlled by any government, corporation, or centralized entity; instead, it is created and managed by a network of computers across the world.

Bitcoin Cash was created as a “hard fork” of Bitcoin in August 2017. The fork occurred when the Bitcoin blockchain was split in two after a majority of miners (the computers that keep the network running) voted to decide between two competing visions for the future of Bitcoin.
Because the Bitcoin network was only able to process a limited number of transactions per second, many believed that the Bitcoin blockchain was not suitable for mainstream adoption.
Banks and other large institutions have begun investing heavily in blockchain technology in recent years. Many believe that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the global financial system significantly and reduce the costs of many services by as much as 28%.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be “mined” by computers. Bitcoin mining refers to the process of validating and confirming transactions on the network. In return for investing the computing power behind the network, miners are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins for each block they validate.
The Bitcoin blockchain is the distributed ledger that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that store and validate all of the information.
When you make a transaction using Bitcoin (either by sending, receiving, or purchasing), the information is sent to the blockchain and recorded as a public ledger.
Because the blockchain is public, anyone can see the transaction (as well as the amount, location, and other information related to the transaction).

## The Difference Between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash

The core difference between these two currencies is that Bitcoin Cash was created as a fork of Bitcoin to solve its scaling issues. What this means is that the Bitcoin Cash network has the ability to process a much larger number of transactions per second than Bitcoin.
Because of this, Bitcoin Cash is considered more scalable than Bitcoin and has a larger potential user base.
Another difference between the two is the size of their respective networks. Bitcoin is one of the most established cryptocurrencies, and its network is significantly larger than that of Bitcoin Cash.
The number of Bitcoin nodes (computers that store the blockchain) is estimated to be around 10,000, while the number of Bitcoin Cash nodes is about 10,000.

## Why did Bitcoin Cash fork?

One of the most common issues in cryptocurrency is that of scalability. Bitcoin has been criticized for its slow transaction times and high transaction fees. As the network grew, these issues became more and more prominent.
The Bitcoin network can process a maximum of seven transactions per second. In comparison, Visa, the most commonly used credit card payment network, can process 24,000 transactions per second.
This means that Bitcoin is not a viable solution for many businesses looking to use blockchain technology for their payment methods.

## Where can I buy Bitcoin Cash?

You can choose to purchase Bitcoin Cash through an intermediary exchange or through an investment fund.
If you use an intermediary exchange, you’ll be able to swap one type of coin for another. If you choose to purchase a fund, you’ll receive shares of the fund, which will represent your ownership of a collection of cryptocurrencies.
If you buy Bitcoin Cash, you can choose to store it in a digital wallet.

## Should you invest in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?

This decision is up to you! As we mentioned earlier, the main difference between the two currencies is their scalability. Bitcoin Cash is able to process a larger number of transactions per second, while Bitcoin is able to process a higher number of transactions (in general).
So if you are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, keep in mind that these digital assets are extremely volatile. The prices of cryptocurrencies are subject to rapid change and can fall as quickly as they rise.

## Final Words: Which coin should you invest in?

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two of the most popular altcoins. They are also two of the most widely traded digital tokens out there, meaning that they are likely to retain their value over time.
What’s more, both of these cryptocurrencies have seen significant growth in the past few years.
This growth has led many investors to predict that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are likely to appreciate even further in the future.
This means that if you are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two of the best options.
