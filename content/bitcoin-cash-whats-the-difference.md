Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that was created in August 2017. It is a fork of Bitcoin, meaning that it is a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain with some changes. The most notable change is that Bitcoin Cash has an 8 MB block size, compared to Bitcoin's 1 MB block size. This means that Bitcoin Cash can handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash was created because some people in the Bitcoin community were not happy with the way that Bitcoin was being developed. They thought that Bitcoin was becoming too centralized, and they wanted to make a version of Bitcoin that was more decentralized.

Bitcoin Cash is different from Bitcoin in other ways, too. For example, it uses a different proof-of-work algorithm, which means that miners can mine Bitcoin Cash with less expensive hardware than they would need to mine Bitcoin.

So, what's the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash? Well, it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a cryptocurrency that can handle more transactions per second, then Bitcoin Cash is a good choice. If you're looking for a cryptocurrency that is more decentralized, then Bitcoin Cash is also a good choice.
