## What is Tron?

Tron is an entertainment crypto that offers users a new way to experience entertainment like never before. Based on its blockchain network and unique TRX coin, Tron offers users a wide range of services including gaming and gambling, social media, and more. For a more in-depth look at what Tron does and how it works, keep reading.

Tron was developed by Justin Sun, a Chinese entrepreneur and former Ripple representative who has been working in the blockchain world since 2010. The idea behind Tron is to provide entertainment — both content and the process of acquiring and enjoying it — through the blockchain. The company’s official website describes it as a “decentralized ecosystem for the global digital entertainment industry.” The company, which has a team of over 100 employees, has set a goal of becoming the “largest decentralized Internet ecosystem.”

## Why Decentralization?

Decentralization is associated almost exclusively with the crypto industry, but what is decentralized technology and how does it differ from normal technology? In a nutshell, decentralization is the process of distributing power away from a central authority and giving it to a network of people or other entities. To put it another way, decentralization is not controlled by a single person or entity, but by a community. It’s how companies like Uber and Airbnb, for example, operate. Users are given the freedom to decide when, where, and how much they want to drive for the service. Hosts set their own rules for renting out their spaces. The centralized authority, in this case the company management, only steps in when necessary.

## How Does Tron Work?

As the digital world continues to grow and evolve, so, too, do the ways in which we entertain ourselves. Thanks to the Internet and a variety of streaming services, users can access content from almost anywhere — and at any time. Today’s entertainment is more accessible than ever before. But as this trend continues to expand, many users are beginning to wonder: Are there better ways to deliver and experience entertainment?

Lately, there has been an explosion of decentralized blockchain-based services that cater to nearly every digital need. From investing and finance to social media and online storage, developers have created various solutions for a variety of needs — all through the lens of decentralization. The latest venture in this growing sector is Tron (TRX), an entertainment crypto that offers users a new way to experience entertainment like never before.

## Tron’s Partnerships

Tron’s goal of becoming the world’s largest decentralized Internet ecosystem can only be achieved with the help of its many strategic partners. As mentioned, Tron is currently partnered with BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file sharing platform that boasts over 100 million users. The partnership’s goal is to create a more “incentivized and decentralized Internet” through the creation of an Internet of Volumes (IoV).

The company has also partnered with the Chinese blockchain giant Fenbushi Capital, as well as several Chinese companies and investors. These partnerships are aimed at expanding Tron’s user base, as well as bringing more DApps (Decentralized Apps) to its network.

## TRX and Hosting Services

Decentralization isn’t just about creating a web-based platform — it’s also about creating an economy that supports it. That’s why Tron offers users the ability to host content on its network and be rewarded in TRX coins. Anyone with a connected device can become a host by downloading Tron’s software, which only takes a few minutes.

Once the software is downloaded and installed, users can create a free account and start earning TRX tokens. Hosts can then spend their tokens to download various pieces of content. Alternatively, they can sell their tokens to other users.

## The Tron Virtual Machine (TVM)

The Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) is the engine that powers Tron’s decentralized network. It’s the first Turing Complete public blockchain in the world, capable of processing millions of transactions each second. The TVM is also a smart contract platform that allows millions of users to exchange all kinds of tokens on the Tron network.

Tron’s TVM also allows developers to create DApps on the decentralization network. It’s the TVM’s unique programming language that allows developers to create and launch decentralized applications quickly and efficiently.

## Where to buy and hold Tron?

As the entertainment crypto continues to grow in popularity, more and more investors and crypto enthusiasts are beginning to take notice. That has led to an increase in the coin’s value over time, which is promising. As the leading coin in terms of total market cap, Tron is available on many popular exchanges, such as Binance, OKEx, Huobi, and many others.

Users can also purchase TRX coins directly through the Tron website using a variety of accepted payment methods, including PayPal, credit card, and more. Alternatively, they can store their coins in a Tron wallet.

## Conclusion

The entertainment industry continues to evolve as technology becomes increasingly advanced. Now, more than ever, there is a growing demand for decentralized blockchain platforms. Tron is one of the top entertainment crypto networks that offers users a new way to experience entertainment like never before.
