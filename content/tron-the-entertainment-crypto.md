TRON is a blockchain-based, decentralized protocol project with an internal cryptocurrency called TRX. The project aims to construct a global free content entertainment system with the blockchain and distributed storage technology. The protocol allows each user to freely publish, store and own data, and in the decentralized autonomous form, decides the distribution, subscription and push of contents and enables content creators by releasing, circulating and dealing with digital assets, thus forming a decentralized content entertainment ecosystem.

TRON was founded in September 2017 by Justin Sun, a former Ripple Labs employee. Sun is also the founder of the Peiwo app, which is the largest audio content community in China with over 10 million users. TRON Foundation raised a total of $70 million in a private ICO in January and February 2018, making it one of the largest ICOs at that time. The TRON Foundation is registered in Singapore.

The native currency of the TRON network is Tronix (TRX). TRX can be used by content creators to pay for content or by users to access content. TRX can also be used to vote for candidates to become Super Representatives. Super Representatives are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the network. The top 27 Super Representatives are elected by the community through voting. The TRON network also supports other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS), and Tether (USDT).

The TRON Protocol has three layers: storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer is composed of block storage and state storage. Block storage is used to store all transactions in the form of blocks, while state storage records the current status of all accounts. The core layer is responsible for smart contracts and account management. The application layer is where users interact with dApps.

TRON uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm which is different from the traditional Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Under DPoS, there are only a fixed number of block producers, which are elected by the community through voting. Block producers produce blocks in turn and are rewarded with TRX for their work. DPoS is more energy efficient than PoW or PoS as there is no need for mining or staking.

The TRON Protocol has been designed to be scalable so that it can handle a large number of transactions per second. The current TPS is 2,000 and the team is working on increasing it to 10,000 TPS by the end of 2019. TRON also uses sharding which further increases its scalability.

The TRON Protocol has been built on top of Ethereum but is incompatible with Ethereum smart contracts due to differences in design. TRON plans to launch its own mainnet in Q2 2018 which will be fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts.

The TRON Foundation has partnerships with some of the largest companies in the world such as Baidu, Jack Ma's Ant Financial, and Tencent. These partnerships will help TRON to gain mass adoption once its mainnet launches.

TRON is one of the most ambitious blockchain projects and has the potential to disrupt the global entertainment industry.
