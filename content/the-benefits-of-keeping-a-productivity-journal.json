You don\\u2019t want to fail the course, lose your scholarship and end up homeless somewhere in a strange city where none of your friends live. However, all of this seems much more appealing than getting back to work on the project again; it\\u2019s even more appealing than thinking about how difficult life will be without the degree or scholarship at home.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Many business travelers are afraid to fly. Even those who aren\\u2019t afraid to fly are thinking twice about whether it\\u2019s worth the risk of contracting flu on a plane.

Some airlines have even ceased operations completely until demand returns or they see an opportunity for sustainable growth once the pandemic ends.\nThe global pandemic has impacted all airlines, not just those directly affected regions.
