Well, if that sounds like you \\u2014 as a programmer \\u2014 then keep reading because we have some good news for you! Debugging your code is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks as a coder. It requires patience, precision, and analytical skills to identify where things aren\\u2019t working correctly and why. However, with the right strategies and techniques, debugging your code doesn\\u2019t need to be a painful process.

Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques.
