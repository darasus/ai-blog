## You Can Learn the Skills You Need for Your Job

The skills you need for your job might be very different from those used in a typical classroom setting. For example, you might need to be able to communicate your research findings to a wide range of audiences, such as colleagues, policymakers, or the general public. Or perhaps you have to collaborate with other scientists across disciplines or manage a team of researchers.
These are skills you can develop through self-learning. If you’re working towards a career in science communication, you can learn the necessary tools and strategies by reading books, watching videos, and participating in online discussions. If you need to collaborate with people from different fields, you can learn the necessary techniques through online courses or even by reading books that describe different approaches.

## You Can Develop Your Knowledge of Your Field

You might already be close to reaching the end of your formal education and be ready to start applying for jobs. Or maybe you’re still in school and want to develop a deeper understanding of your field as you approach graduation.
Whatever your situation, you can use self-learning to learn more about your specific field of study and its related disciplines. This can help you stand out in interviews and on your resume. For example, if you want to work in environmental science, you can explore related topics such as chemistry and biology to better understand the challenges you’ll face. This can also help you choose a research topic that fits within your field of study—a topic that hiring managers will be particularly interested in.

## Self-Learning Helps Build Your Confidence

As you learn through self-study, you’re likely to make mistakes and encounter areas where you need to improve. These are all part of the learning process. Working through your mistakes and improving your skills builds your confidence in your abilities.
For example, let’s say you’re interested in working in environmental science. You might decide to read a few books on chemistry, biology, and geology to explore ways these disciplines are relevant to your field. You might also read a few books on environmental policy and learn about the career challenges facing environmental scientists. As you explore these topics, you’re bound to encounter things you don’t know or don’t understand. This is a normal part of learning, so don’t let it discourage you. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn even more about your chosen field.

## Self-Learning Is Good for Your Career

The best way to prepare for a career in science is to actually be a scientist. While you’re in school, your job is to learn the basics of the various fields of study. Once you’re out of school, your job is to apply that knowledge in real-world scenarios, collaborate with other researchers, and communicate your findings in a way that others can understand and use.
Self-learning helps prepare you for all of these challenges. It gives you the flexibility and knowledge you need to tackle a variety of challenges in your career. It also helps you develop the skills you need to communicate your findings, collaborate with others, and solve problems with confidence.

## How to Self-Learn as a Scientist

Self-learning is a skill you can use before, during, and after your formal education. Ideally, you should begin self-learning as early as possible to give yourself the greatest advantage.
You can start by exploring subjects that pique your interest and seem relevant to your goals. You can also look for online courses and reading lists that interest you. As you explore new subjects, don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty and try things out. This is the best way to learn new skills and master them.
You can continue to self-learn during your formal education. Choose courses that don’t just teach you the basics of your field but also give you hands-on experience with the tools, skills, and research approaches you’ll likely use in your career.

## Conclusion

People often think of scientists as people who spend all their time in a lab, peering through a microscope or testing tubes filled with strange liquids. While this is one small part of what it means to be a scientist, it isn't exclusive to professionals. Whether you want to work in research, education, industry, or another science-related field, you can use self-learning to reach your goals. Self-learning gives you flexibility in where and when you study, so it fits with your schedule and other commitments. You also have more control over what you learn and how fast you progress. The result is greater confidence in your abilities and an increased ability to tackle challenges.
