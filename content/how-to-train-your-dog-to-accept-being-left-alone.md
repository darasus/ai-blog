summary: Dogs are instinctively den animals, so when left alone, they’ll try to
  find a place that feels safe and comfortable. Find an appropriate crate to
  train your dog to be alone and crate them for short periods of time. Set
  ground rules while you’re home to set the tone for how the house rules work.
  Give your dog plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, and nutrition to help
  them feel secure in their surroundings. Give them toys such as puzzle toys to
  keep them busy while you are out or at work.
intro: As much as we love our dogs, and vice versa, no one likes the dreaded
  "crap, I have to go back to work" feeling. Putting your dog in a boarding
  facility or kennel isn’t an easy decision for most pet owners, especially if
  you have a sensitive breed (i.e., lots of barking = unhappy dogs). So how can
  you get your pup ready to be on their own? It’s not as simple as locking them
  in a closet for a few hours once or twice and then expecting them to be cool
  with it. Dogs don’t think like people; they don’t understand symbolic actions
  like turning off the light as meaning that you won’t be coming back home
  tonight. They have instinctual fear responses that need to be addressed
  specifically with training and care before leaving them alone.

## Set ground rules while you’re home

Your dog’s ability to be successful while you’re not home starts when you’re still home. It’s important to set the tone for how the house rules work: you’re the leader, you’re in control, and even if you’re away, you’re still the one setting the rules. Simple things like letting your pup know what rooms are off-limits and what areas are okay for them to explore can help them feel secure in their surroundings. If you want your dog to stay off the couch but love to sprawl out in the middle of the floor, you can use a deterrent like double-sided tape. This way, neither you nor your pup has to hurt each other’s feelings while you’re both trying to communicate.

## Finding and using a crate

Dogs are instinctively den animals, so when left alone, they’ll try to find a place that feels safe and comfortable. Finding an appropriate crate to train your dog to be alone and crate them for short periods of time is vital for success. The crate should be big enough for your dog to comfortably stand up, sit down, turn around, and lie on their side or back comfortably. Dogs should never be crated for long periods of time.

When you’re home, the crate can be used as a quiet area for your dog to relax or sleep. It should have a comfy crate pad and water and food bowls within reach. Once you’re ready to start crate training your dog, gradually increase the amount of time they spend in it.

## Dog-proof your house

Are there dangers lurking in your house? It’s important to make sure your dog’s environment is safe. Make sure all cleaning supplies are out of reach, as well as any potential toxic foods that could harm your dog. Be sure to keep plants out of reach as well.

If you have a puppy that isn’t fully trained yet, keep them confined to an appropriate room like a kitchen or bathroom. This way you can keep a close eye on them and they can’t wreak havoc all over the house. Be sure to set up a comfortable bed for them to lay on while they stay in this room.
Dispose of any potential dangers that may harm your dog. This includes cleaning out your mailbox (mailmen don’t like dogs jumping in there and chewing up their mail), windowsills (where bugs can be hiding), and any plants that may cause your dog harm. Your dog is your best friend, but they can also be your worst enemy if they get their teeth into something they shouldn’t.

## Train your dog to be comfortable alone

Dog training and specific dog behavior modification are vital in helping your dog become comfortable being alone. There are lots of websites and apps that have different methods you can use. Like humans, every dog is different, so the methods that work for one dog may not work for another. Some dog training methods to help your dog get comfortable being alone include:

## Final words

One of the best ways to improve your dog's ability to be alone is to give them plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, and nutrition. This can be achieved by playing games with your pup as well as feeding them appropriate foods. You can also give them toys such as puzzle toys that will keep them busy while you are out or at work. If your dog is not accustomed to you leaving them alone, it will take time. Remember to stay patient and always be consistent with your training methods. Your pup will get there eventually, and in the meantime, keep them entertained with games and toys.
