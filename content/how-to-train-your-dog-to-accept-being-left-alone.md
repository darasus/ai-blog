It can be difficult to leave your dog home alone, but there are ways to make the experience more positive for both of you. Start by teaching your dog some basic obedience commands like sit, stay, and come. Once your dog has mastered these commands, you can begin to work on leaving them alone. Start by leaving them alone for short periods of time, like while you run to the store. Gradually increase the amount of time you're gone until you're able to leave them alone for several hours. Be sure to give your dog plenty of exercise before you leave so they're tired and less likely to get into trouble. You should also leave them with some toys or bones to keep them occupied. Finally, make sure to give your dog plenty of love and attention when you return so they know that they're still a priority in your life.
