## 13-inch Screen Macbook Pro

The 13-inch Macbook Pro is the most popular version, and the one we would recommend to most people. It’s compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. It’s also the cheapest option, making it a great choice if you’re on a budget. It’s a great laptop for running multiple programs at once, with 8 GB RAM and a 256 GB SSD, and if you’re a student or someone who travels a lot, this is the one we would recommend. It’s not the most powerful laptop, but it’s powerful enough for most people, and it’s great for everyday use. It’s the most reliable version too, so it’s definitely worth considering if you’re after a Macbook Pro.

## 15-inch Screen Macbook Pro

The 15-inch Macbook Pro is the best version for people who need more power. It’s a more heavyweight option, but it’s great if you run heavy programs like photo editing, video editing or if you’re a designer. The bigger screen size is also great for watching movies and TV shows, so if you’re an avid TV binger, this one is a good option. One thing to note is that the 15-inch Macbook Pro is only available with a Touch Bar, so if you don’t need a Touch Bar, it’s not worth the extra money. It’s also a more expensive option, so it’s worth considering if you really need a more powerful laptop. It’s a great option for people who run programming, design or video editing software regularly.

## 17-inch Screen Macbook Pro

The 17-inch Macbook Pro is the best option for people who need a laptop for work. It’s the most powerful option out of the Macbook Pros, as it has two fans to keep the laptop cool, and a giant battery life of up to 10 hours. It’s also the biggest, so if portability is important to you, it’s definitely worth avoiding. That said, it’s the best option for people who need their laptop to run multiple programs at once, making it the best option for people who work regularly on the go.

It’s worth noting that it comes with an IGP instead of a discrete GPU, so it’s not the best option for editing videos or running graphic design software. If you need a laptop for work, this is the best option, but it’s worth considering if you want something more portable.

## Touch Bar Macbook Pro

The Touch Bar Macbook Pro comes in both the 15-inch and the 13-inch version and costs a little more than the non-Touch Bar version. It’s a great option if you’re after a Touch Bar, but don’t want to pay the extra money for the IGP. It’s a good choice if you want the Touch Bar, but don’t want a more heavyweight option. It’s also worth noting that the 13-inch model is lighter and more compact than the 15-inch model, so if portability is important to you, it’s worth considering. It’s worth noting that the 13-inch model is only available with an IGP, so if you want a Touch Bar, you need to go with the 15-inch model.

## Integrated Graphics Processor (IGP) Macbook Pro

The IGP Macbook Pro comes in both the 13 and 15-inch versions, and it’s the cheapest option, making it great if you’re on a budget. That said, it’s worth being aware that the IGP makes it more difficult for programs to run at once, so it’s not the best option for people who run heavy programs regularly. It’s a good option for people who want to use the Macbook Pro for everyday tasks, and don’t need a laptop for work. It’s definitely worth considering if you want a cheap Macbook Pro, but it’s worth being aware that you won’t get the best performance out of the three.

## Storage Space and RAM in the Macbook Pro

The Macbook Pro comes with either 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB of storage space, so if storage space is important to you, it’s worth considering how much you need. 128 GB is the minimum amount of storage space needed, but if you’re someone who likes to store a lot on their laptop, or if you need to regularly store files, it’s worth going for the 256 GB or 512 GB option.

The Macbook Pro also comes with 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM, so if you need more than 8 GB, it’s worth considering the 16 GB option. It’s important to note that models with 16 GB of RAM only come with the 1 TB of storage space, so it’s worth keeping that in mind if you need more storage space.

## Conclusion

The MacBook Pro is an excellent choice for people who want a laptop for a variety of different tasks. It’s a powerful machine, and there is a version for everyone, no matter what you need it for. It’s important to consider what screen size you want, what version you want, and how much storage space you need to make sure you get the best model for your needs.
