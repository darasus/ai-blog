## Morning routine

When you start your day with a good routine, you set yourself up for success and help yourself stay productive. Create a morning routine that prepares you to be productive, focused, and energized. Some ideas include: Taking care of your health and wellness : exercise, eating well, drinking lots of water, and getting enough sleep so you have enough energy to tackle the day.

: exercise, eating well, drinking lots of water, and getting enough sleep so you have enough energy to tackle the day. Taming your inbox : clean up your inbox, delete unnecessary emails, and mark emails that require action with a due date.

: clean up your inbox, delete unnecessary emails, and mark emails that require action with a due date. Reflecting on your goals : take a few minutes in the morning to reflect on your goals, visualize yourself accomplishing them, and write down your plans for the day.

## Establish clear goals

Goals give us direction, help us measure success, and create a vision for the future. Having clear goals will help you stay productive and focused on what you need to do each day. There are many ways you can go about setting goals, but one useful approach is the SMART goal setting method. SMART stands for: Specific : be very clear about what you want to achieve.

: be very clear about what you want to achieve. Measurable : know when you have achieved your goal.

: know when you have achieved your goal. Actionable : know what you need to do to achieve your goal.

: know what you need to do to achieve your goal. Realistic : your goals should be within your reach.

: your goals should be within your reach. Time-bound: set a clear deadline for when you want to achieve your goal. Specific goals are much more effective than general goals. A general goal might be to get more done at work, but a specific goal might be to get through a certain number of tasks every day.

## Create a to-do list

A to-do list can be a great way to organize your thoughts, break down large tasks into smaller chunks, and help you stay focused on what needs to be done. There are many methods for creating to-do lists, but there are a few things to consider. How do you prefer to write down your to-do list? On paper? In a word processing document? On a whiteboard? Where do you prefer to write it down? In a notebook? On a computer? Is there a time of day when it’s best to write down your tasks? These are all factors to consider when choosing a method. There are many different ways to create a to do list. Some examples include creating a to do list based on urgency, importance, or other factors, creating a to do list based on a calendar event, creating a to do list based on a project, and more. The method you choose doesn’t matter as long as you actually write down your tasks and review your to-do list regularly.

## Turn off email notifications

Email is one of the most distracting and unproductive things many of us do at work. Having email pop up on your computer or phone every time a new message comes in is distracting. It’s difficult to stay focused on your work when the notification noise is nonstop. There are a few ways to turn off email notifications and help yourself stay productive. You can set up email rules to automatically have emails sent to a folder so they don’t show up as unread and in your inbox. You can also choose to only have emails sent to an unread folder instead of an inbox, or you can set up rules to have emails be sent directly to your spam folder. You can also use a service like an email blocker that will turn off notifications on your computer and phone.

## Track your time

We all have a finite amount of time each day, so it’s important to use your time as effectively as possible. If you want to stay productive, you must track how you’re spending your time. This will help you identify the areas of your life where you’re wasting time and where you could be more productive. There are many different ways you can track your time. Some examples include keeping a running to do list, using a time management app, keeping a journal, and more. There is no one right way to track your time, but you must track how you’re spending your time so you can make adjustments and see your progress.

## Don't multitask

Multitasking has become a common practice, but research shows it can actually make us less productive because we can’t focus and get our work done as efficiently. Instead of multitasking, try focusing on one thing at a time and give it your full attention. This will allow you to fully concentrate on the task at hand and get it done more efficiently, which will leave you with more time to work on other tasks. When you’re working on a task, try to block out everything else and focus on the task at hand. Put away your phone, close your computer, and focus solely on that one task until you’re done.

You can also use these tips to help yourself stay productive throughout the day. Remember that each day is a new day and each day is a new opportunity to be more productive and get more done. By actively focusing on these tips, you can help yourself stay more focused and get more done, helping to create a life you love!

## Conclusion

Productivity is an important skill that can help you achieve more, feel less stressed, and have more time to do the things you love. There are many habits you can implement to help you stay productive, including starting your day with a clear plan and prioritizing tasks, establishing clear goals, creating a to do list, and choosing not to multitask. Remember that every day is a new day, and there are endless ways you can improve your productivity, no matter how unproductive you feel you are currently!
