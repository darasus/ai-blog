summary: Climate Change is an increase in the world’s average temperature that
  is expected to have significant effects on ecosystems and human society. The
  effects of climate change include the extinction of some species and the
  alteration of ecosystems with major effects on agriculture, water availability
  and public health. By living a more eco-friendly lifestyle, we each can have a
  positive effect on climate change. We can make a difference in the fight
  against climate change by changing our eating and drinking habits, driving
  less and changing the light bulbs in our homes.

## What is Climate Change?

Climate change is an increase in the world’s average temperature that is expected to have significant effects on ecosystems and human society. The increase in temperatures will be due to an increase in the amount of green house gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere.

There are major effects on plant and animal species, on fisheries, on soils and on the availability of water. These effects will be felt most strongly in the tropics and sub-tropics, but will be noticeable almost everywhere.

## Why Should We Care About Climate Change?

The effects of climate change include the extinction of some species and the alteration of ecosystems with major effects on agriculture, water availability and public health.

Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. It will also increase the prevalence of droughts, particularly in the tropics and subtropics, and will increase the number of people affected by floods. There will be increased pressure on water resources around the world.

## What Can We Do About Climate Change?

By living a more eco-friendly lifestyle, we each can have a positive effect on the world’s climate.

By changing our eating and drinking habits, driving less and changing the light bulbs in our homes, we can make a difference in the fight against climate change.

## Go Vegetarian Or Vegan

One of the most effective ways to reduce your CO2 emissions is to go vegetarian or vegan. Producing meat is a very energy-intensive process, and it’s estimated to account for at least 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Meat products have also increased in price as droughts have caused problems for many farmers. Eating more vegetables and fewer meat products will do wonders for the environment and your wallet.

## Reduce, Reuse And Recycle

Another really easy way to reduce your carbon footprint is by reducing the amount of waste you produce. By switching to a reusable coffee mug, water bottle and reusable shopping bags, you can save thousands of paper cups and plastic bags every year. Recycling is another easy way to reduce your carbon footprint. Recycling saves around 50% of the energy needed to produce new paper, and can be done with almost every type of paper product, including cardboard, newspapers and magazines.

## Install A Water Saving Shower Head

By installing a water-saving shower head, you can reduce the water you use in your home by up to 50%. This is great for the environment, as well as your wallet, as water is a limited resource. The most eco-friendly shower heads use a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute. As a general rule, the more expensive the shower head, the more efficient it is.

## Install A Programmable Thermostat

By installing a programmable thermostat, you can reduce your energy consumption by up to 10%. This is a very simple way to make a big difference to your carbon footprint. It’s estimated that a single programmable thermostat can reduce the CO2 emissions of an entire household by an average of 100lbs per year.

## Drive An Eco-friendly Vehicle

By driving an eco-friendly vehicle, you can reduce your carbon dioxide emissions by up to 75%. Although cars can produce a lot of CO2, there are many models that are low-emission or even carbon neutral. Many cities in the US now offer tax breaks to drivers who choose to drive a low-emission vehicle.

## Conclusion

Reducing your carbon footprint is one of the simplest ways you can help combat climate change. By making small changes to your daily routine, you can make a big difference. Whether you go vegan, reduce your waste, or change your shower head, every little helps. Together, we can make a real difference.
