And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them.

It\\u2019s great that they want to explore the world around them and make new discoveries every day, but what isn\\u2019t so great is when they keep you up at night with their shenanigans. Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company.

How about your dog? Dogs love to chew. It\\u2019s something that comes naturally for them, and there are many things you can buy or make that will help satisfy their natural instincts to chew. But as much as dogs love to have objects that they can gnaw on, it\\u2019s not always safe \\u2013 or advisable \\u2013 to let them do it in the home. There are plenty of household items that dogs shouldn\\u2019t be allowed to chew, because it could lead to potential hazards or unsanitary conditions.\nEven if your dog has never chewed on inappropriate things before, a new puppy will almost certainly try out things beyond what is safe for him. How you train him from the very beginning will determine how much damage he can do if he goes after something he shouldn\\u2019t. So read on and learn how to stop your dog from chewing on anything other than his own toys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
