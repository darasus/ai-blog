This method of resolving disputes with another party without going to court is becoming increasingly common. While mediation isn\\u2019t for everyone, there are some distinct advantages that it offers over traditional litigation.\nMediation allows you to resolve your dispute with another party in a private and confidential setting that\\u2019s neutral and objective. In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings. A mediated settlement is binding and requires no further action from either party after reaching an agreement. If you\\u2019re currently involved in a legal dispute, here are three reasons why mediation may be beneficial for you:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

They\\u2019re enigmatic creatures with a reputation for being aloof and independent; they don\\u2019t ask for much and they keep very little as repayment.
