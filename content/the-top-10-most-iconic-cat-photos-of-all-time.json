Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them.

The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have.
