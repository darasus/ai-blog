Mediation is a process through which two or more parties can resolve their differences with the help of a neutral third party. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties, but rather helps them to reach their own agreement.

There are many different types of mediators, each with their own area of expertise. For example, there are mediators who specialize in family law, workplace disputes, and commercial disputes.

The best way to find a mediator is to ask for referrals from friends, family, or colleagues who have used mediation to resolve a dispute. You can also contact your local bar association or the American Arbitration Association.

Once you have found a mediator, you will need to schedule a meeting. At the meeting, the mediator will explain the mediation process and answer any questions you may have. The mediator will then meet with each party separately to discuss the dispute.

After the initial meeting, the mediator will schedule additional meetings as needed. The mediation process can take several weeks or even months to complete.

If you are unable to reach an agreement through mediation, you can still pursue other options, such as arbitration or litigation.
