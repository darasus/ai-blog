## The Synths Are as Big a Star as ever

The synth is the backbone of Chvrches’ sound, and it rarely gets more explicit than on “Love Is Dead.” The band sometimes softens their approach, making the synths feel almost like a part of the background, but here they stand out at every moment.
The synths are a big part of what makes “Love Is Dead” such a fun record, but they also give the album a dystopian, nightmarish feel. In “Graffiti,” the synths seem to crawl over Mayberry’s voice and create an eerie, pulsing atmosphere.
The synths are loud and apparent on every track, and that seems like a statement in and of itself. The band is known for their synth-heavy sound, and here they embrace it without reservation. They’re not hiding behind anything or trying to be subtle. The synths are in your face, and they don’t care if they scare you.

## Lauren Mayberry’s vocals are razor-sharp

As if to prove that the synths aren’t the only strong element on “Love Is Dead,” Mayberry’s vocals are sharply focused and precise throughout the record.
Mayberry’s voice is a major component of what makes Chvrches Chvrches. Before the band, she was known for her work as a journalist, but her voice has always been her greatest asset. On “Love Is Dead,” she sounds more confident than ever. Her vocals hit sharp and clear, like a knife slicing through the air.
Her voice is abrasive and sharp but also beautiful and poignant. It’s a powerful combination, one that makes her a force to be reckoned with on this album.

## The drums hit harder than ever before

The drums on “Love Is Dead” are a force to be reckoned with. They aren’t a subtle instrument; they’re in your face, and they demand your attention.
The drums hit hard and heavy, and they never let up. They’re a consistent presence throughout the record, hitting you on the head every time you start to relax.
The drums are a sign of strength, and they feel like a declaration of power. They’re aggressive and relentless, and they never let up.
The drums have always been a strong element of the Chvrches sound, but they feel more important than ever on “Love Is Dead.” They’re in your face from the first track to the last, and they don’t care if you like it or not.

## “Love Is Dead” is an important social commentary record

The pop punk elements and aggressiveness of “Love Is Dead” are fun and exciting, but they’re also important social commentary. The lyrics are barbed, and they pull no punches when it comes to criticizing society’s ills.
The title track takes aim squarely at toxic masculinity and the ways that men have mistreated women throughout history and in the present day. In the chorus, Mayberry sings, “Till you’re bent and broken/Till you’re buried in the ground/And your love is dead.”
The song “Deliverance” touches on the current refugee crisis and the rise of nationalism. The song calls out the West for its hypocrisy, with Mayberry singing, “You can take your democracy/And shove it down your throat.”

## Conclusion
