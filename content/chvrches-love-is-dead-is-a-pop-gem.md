summary: The first track is a fun summer vibe with acoustic guitar and a bass

  moment and not worrying about tomorrow because you don’t know what it will
  bring. This song is a little darker than the first with lyrics about trying to
  forget a bad situation, but being unable to escape it. It features a heavy
  drum beat and a haunting synth melody. It's about needing a body guard because

intro: >-
  In today’s musical landscape, popular electronic music has taken over the
  pop world. But there are still some great pop albums that aren’t filled with
  auto-tune and EDM drops.On May 25th, the Scottish band Chvrches released their
  third album called “ Love is Dead.” The synth-pop band has lots of happy vibes
  and catchy hooks on their new album. It’s a pleasant listen but might not be
  what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band
  took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and
  death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record. 

  Chvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!

## Track-by-track Review of “Love Is Dead”

Forever

This song is the first track on the album and is a fun summer vibe with acoustic guitar and a bass line that will make you want to dance. It’s a catchy tune that sets the tone for the rest of the album, which is upbeat and optimistic. The lyrics are about being happy in the moment and not worrying about tomorrow because you don’t know what it will bring. It’s a great song to get you out of a funk.

Never Hear Again

This song is a little darker than the first with lyrics about trying to forget a bad situation, but being unable to escape it. It features a heavy drum beat and a haunting synth melody. The chorus and vocals are catchy, with Lauren Mayberry singing about the fact that “the world will never hear again,” which is about how she doesn’t want to hear about the old situation that upset her anymore.

Deliverance

This song has a strong beat that makes you want to move. It has a strong bass line and a catchy synth melody. The lyrics are about rising above a bad situation and overcoming it to be stronger and more confident. The song talks about rising above the situation and turning it into something good.

Graffiti On The Train Window

This tunes is slower than the others, but it has a catchy melody and has a really great message. The lyrics are about seeing something sad and wanting to do something about it but being too afraid so you “write it on the train window.” It’s about being an armchair activist and not actually making the change. The song is about realizing that you can actually make a difference if you don’t stand idly by and do nothing.

Body Guard

This song is a little different than the rest of the album because it’s a little more aggressive and a little less upbeat. It’s a little slower and doesn’t have as many synths. It’s about needing a body guard because the world is a scary place. It’s a nice change of pace and brings a little variety to the album.

Bottom Of The Ocean

This is another slower song on the album and sounds like it could be about a bad breakup. It’s a little less upbeat and more somber than the rest of the record. It’s about wanting to go back to a relationship that’s over and wanting to “go back to the bottom of the ocean where we started.” It’s about wanting to go back to a place where nothing bad has happened yet. It’s a nice way to end the album with a somber tone.

Thank you for reading.
