Chvrches' 'Love Is Dead' is a pop gem. The album is a perfect blend of synth-pop, indie rock, and electronic music. The production is top-notch, the songwriting is excellent, and the vocals are absolutely gorgeous. Every track on the album is catchy and memorable, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this record. 'Love Is Dead' is an instant classic, and I can't wait to see what Chvrches do next.
