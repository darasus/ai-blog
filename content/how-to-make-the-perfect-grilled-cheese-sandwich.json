But what you eat also plays a huge role in how quickly or slowly your weight loss comes off. What you put on your plate is critical because every food has a set amount of calories and specific nutrients \\u2014 not all foods are created equal. Some foods help you lose weight faster and keep it off, while others have the opposite effect, either because they are high in sugar, fat or calories, or because they have very little nutritional value.\nSuch dietetic staples as broccoli and blueberries are great for losing weight.
