## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". An "object" is a combination of code and data, usually represented as a data structure, that performs some useful function. In object-oriented programming, we collect all the related code and data for a specific "object" into one computer file, and then create as many instances of that file as we need for our program. Each instance is called an "object" and has its own data fields and performs its own functions.
Different programming languages have different rules for the types of objects you can create and how you create and use them. In Java, the most popular language for web development, all code must be contained in a class. A class is a type of object that contains fields and methods that perform some function. Java classes must follow specific rules to be considered "object-oriented". These rules are covered in this article.

## Object Oriented Programming With Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language. All code in Java is contained within a class, and all classes are instances of a parent class called "java.lang.Object". Classes in Java must follow certain rules to be considered "object oriented". These rules are covered in this article.

Classes - In Java, all code is contained within a class. A class is a type of object that contains fields and methods that perform some function.

Fields - A field is a variable declared in a class that can store data for the object.

Methods - A method is a function contained within a class that performs some action on the object.

- Encapsulation - The process of combining code and data into a single unit is called encapsulation.

## Overview of OOP in Java

There are 7 major concepts in OOP in Java. Once you understand these concepts, you will have a much better understanding of how to write code in a more object-oriented way.

Classes - A class is a type of object that contains fields and methods that perform some function. Fields - A field is a variable declared in a class that can store data for the object. Constructors - A class can have multiple constructors. A constructor is a method that is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. Objects - When you create an instance of a class, you create an object. Objects contain the data from the fields and call the methods of the class. Inheritance - An object can inherit the code and data from another object. Polymorphism - You can call the same method with different data types. Interfaces - A class can define methods that other classes must implement.

## Pros of OOP in Java

Object-oriented programming has many benefits. Here are just a few of the many benefits of using this programming paradigm.

Reduced Code Duplication - When you use OOP to write your code, you want to avoid duplication in your code as much as possible. Duplicate code can cause bugs, and it makes your code more difficult to maintain.

Improved Readability - OOP makes your code more readable because you are writing code that focuses on what the code is doing instead of what it knows. This makes it easier for other programmers to read the code and understand how it works.

Faster Development Cycles - As mentioned above, OOP makes code more readable. This makes it easier to find and fix bugs in your code.

## Cons of OOP in Java

Despite all the benefits of OOP in Java, there are some cons to this approach as well.

More Complex - Writing code in a more object-oriented way can make your code more complex to write and understand. This can be especially true when writing code that uses inheritance.

More Verbose - Writing code in a more object-oriented way makes the code longer. This can be especially true when writing code that uses inheritance.

## Conclusion

Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code that focuses on what the program is doing and not just what it knows. This article covers an overview of OOP in Java, as well as its pros and cons. If you are reading this, then you are probably familiar with procedural programming languages like C, C++, or Python. These are all imperative programming languages that focus on telling the computer exactly what to do and when to do it.
