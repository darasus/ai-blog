Whatever your reason for investigating coding, Python is an excellent place to start learning about computer programming and creating your own programs.\nCoding is often a seemingly inaccessible skill, reserved for those with a knack for mathematics or sciences. However, learning to code isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might initially seem. In fact, even if you have no background in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), you can still master the basics of coding. The key is finding the right resources and a step-by-step learning process that doesn\\u2019t feel like a burdensome chore.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to begin exploring the wonderful world of Python coding, read on to learn more.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
