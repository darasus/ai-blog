Imitation of Life is a thought-provoking drama about race and identity. The film follows the lives of two black women who are struggling to find their place in the world. One woman is light-skinned and able to "pass" for white, while the other is dark-skinned and must deal with the racism and discrimination that comes with being black in America.

The film explores the different ways that each woman deals with her identity, and how their choices affect their relationships with their families and friends. It is a powerful film that will leave you thinking about race and identity in America.
