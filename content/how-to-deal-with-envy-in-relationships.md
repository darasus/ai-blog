intro: >-
  Being in a new relationship is exciting and often feels like a whirlwind.
  You spend time getting to know each other and spending time together as much
  as possible. But things can change once you enter a committed relationship or
  get married. Stressors from work, family, friends and other responsibilities
  may arise, putting stress on your relationship. This is when green-eyed
  monster envy creeps in and can have a negative impact on your partner. 

  There are many different types of relationships: friendships, casual dating or serious partners. Regardless of what type of relationships you have with another person, envy probably won’t be far behind if they are important to you. Envy is one of the seven deadly sins for good reason. When we experience envy in a relationship it creates distrust, resentment and can ultimately end things prematurely before they even really begin. However, there are ways to deal with this feeling so that it doesn’t get the better of you.

## What Is Envy?

Envy is when a person feels discontent or resentful because another person has what they want. This can include the actions, possessions or outcomes of the other person. Envy is one of the seven deadly sins, along with greed, lust, sloth, pride, gluttony and anger.
Envy can arise from a variety of situations. For example, you might envy your partner’s ability to fit into their jeans from high school, parent-free time, or financial situation. You could also envy a friend’s relationship, career trajectory or living situation.
Envy is an unfortunate reality for most people at some point. However, it doesn’t have to be something that negatively affects your relationships.

## How To Deal With Envy

There are a few ways that you can deal with envy in your relationship. The first step is to identify what it is that you’re actually feeling. Jot down whatever comes to mind. Once you’ve identified the source of your envy, you can then decide what action you want to take.
Envy can be a good thing because it can show you what you want in your life. Use it as a catalyst to change something in your life. If you envy your partner’s carefree attitude, you might want to go back to school to get a degree in something you’ve always wanted to study. You might envy your friend’s financial situation, and decide to research ways to increase your income.
Envy is mostly harmful if it’s not dealt with. It can lead to resentment, which can then lead to a break up.

## What To Do When Your Partner Is The Cause Of Your Envy

If your partner is the cause of your envy, there are a few things that you should do. First, identify what it is that you envy about them. Next, find out if your partner is aware of what you’re feeling. If they don’t seem to know, then you should talk to them about it.
Being honest with your partner about what you’re feeling can help take the sting out of the situation. It can be a good way to show them that you trust them enough to share your feelings with them.
Envy can sometimes be a good thing. It can be a sign that you admire something about your partner and want to possess that trait in yourself.

## What To Do When You’re The Cause Of Someone Else’s Envy

If you’re the cause of your partner’s envy, the best thing to do is to let them know. You can’t read your partner’s mind, so they may not be consciously aware of what you’re feeling. You can approach the situation in a few different ways.
You could let your partner know that you notice what they envy about you. You could also ask them if they’re feeling envious. You can ask open-ended questions to help them to identify what it is that they want.

## Conclusion

Being in a relationship is an emotional rollercoaster. You’ll experience a wide range of emotions, and envy is one of them. Envy can be a natural part of relationships, but it’s important to recognize when you’re feeling envious and what you can do to manage that feeling. If you’re experiencing feelings of envy, don’t let it ruin your relationship. There are ways to deal with it so that it doesn’t get the best of you.
