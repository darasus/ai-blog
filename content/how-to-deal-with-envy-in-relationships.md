It's normal to feel a twinge of envy when you see a couple that seems happier than you are. But if you find yourself feeling envious more often than not, it could be a sign that your relationship isn't as strong as it could be.

Here are some tips for dealing with envy in relationships:

1. Talk to your partner about what you're feeling.

If you're feeling envious of another couple, talk to your partner about it. They may be able to help you understand why you're feeling that way and what you can do to change it.

2. Don't compare your relationship to others.

Every relationship is different, so it's unfair to compare yours to someone else's. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of your own relationship.

3. Be honest with yourself.

Envy is often a sign that something is lacking in your own relationship. Be honest with yourself about what that is and try to work on it.

4. Don't let envy ruin your relationship.

If you find that envy is starting to damage your relationship, it's time to take a step back and reassess things. Talk to your partner and see if there's anything you can do to change the way you're feeling.
