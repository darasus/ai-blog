  "summary": "Dollar cost averaging is a strategy that you can use to reduce the risk of investing in a particular asset. It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times—not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when high. If markets fall and prices increase, investors who dollar cost average will pay a higher average price for their shares than investors who buy a lump sum. The main drawback is that dollar cost averaging doesn’t guarantee higher returns. It can be applied to lots of different types of investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate.",

If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then. Hence the investor decides to dollar cost average by investing $5,000 today and another $5,000 10 days from now in order to invest the final $5,000 30 days from now \\u2013 spending an equal dollar amount each time ($2,500 per investment). This way they can reduce their risk as well as smooth out the peaks and troughs of their returns.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Typically, the amount you choose will depend on your savings goals. The goal of dollar cost averaging is to lower your average cost per share, which can be achieved by buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. For example, if you invest a fixed $500 in a stock every month, you will have more shares at the end of the year when the price is lower.\nDollar cost averaging is an investment strategy that can help protect you from downside risk if markets are falling. That\\u2019s because it allows you to buy more shares when prices are low, thereby lowering your average cost per share.

In fact, due to the risk-reduction, pooled funds that employ dollar cost averaging have been shown to have a lower standard deviation than their lump-sum counterparts.
