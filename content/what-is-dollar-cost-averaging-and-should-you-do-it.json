  "summary": "Dollar cost averaging is a strategy that you can use to reduce the risk of investing in a particular asset. It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times—not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when high. If markets fall and prices increase, investors who dollar cost average will pay a higher average price for their shares than investors who buy a lump sum. The main drawback is that dollar cost averaging doesn’t guarantee higher returns. It can be applied to lots of different types of investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate.",

If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then.

Typically, the amount you choose will depend on your savings goals. The goal of dollar cost averaging is to lower your average cost per share, which can be achieved by buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. For example, if you invest a fixed $500 in a stock every month, you will have more shares at the end of the year when the price is lower.\nDollar cost averaging is an investment strategy that can help protect you from downside risk if markets are falling.
