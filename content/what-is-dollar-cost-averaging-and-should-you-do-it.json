  "summary": "Dollar cost averaging is a strategy that you can use to reduce the risk of investing in a particular asset. It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times—not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when high. If markets fall and prices increase, investors who dollar cost average will pay a higher average price for their shares than investors who buy a lump sum. The main drawback is that dollar cost averaging doesn’t guarantee higher returns. It can be applied to lots of different types of investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate.",

In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then.

It\\u2019s been proven by research to be a more cost-effective way to invest than buying individual stocks.

An index fund is an investment that aims to track the performance of one or more indexes by holding securities that meet certain criteria as closely as possible.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
