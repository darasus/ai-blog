intro: >-
  Today, mobile devices have become a part of our daily lives. Most people
  use their phones for either calling, texting or browsing the Internet. The
  world has moved on from feature phones to smartphones, which are more than
  just mobile phones. Smartphones come with pre-installed apps such as cameras,
  video players, and messaging services. Moreover, they also support third-party
  apps like music streaming services and games. Today’s mobile users expect
  their devices to be more than just communication tools; they want them to be
  an extension of their digital lifestyle. Therefore, developers need to create
  apps that take advantage of the smaller screen size and speed up load times by
  storing data locally where possible. There are many different programming
  languages used to make mobile applications; however, we will cover four of the
  most commonly used ones: 

  Software development companies generally have some standard set of programming languages that they prefer working with. When it comes to mobile app development you might find one language rising above the rest based on its popularity among developers as well as other factors such as job demand for that specific language. Read on to learn about some of the most common programming languages for developing mobile apps:

## Swift

Swift is a general-purpose programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. It is a simple, modern, and intuitive programming language used by programmers, designers, and developers alike. In fact, Swift is designed to solve many of the problems that have been inherent in other programming languages for a long time, like the excessive use of curly brackets. One of the benefits of choosing Swift for creating your next mobile app is that it’s lightweight. The language also compiles quickly, which is a really helpful feature when you’re developing a mobile app because there’s no longer a need to wait for the code to compile on your computer and then transfer it to the app. Swift runs on a system called “SwiftNets” that lets you quickly and easily build apps for both iOS and Android.

## Java

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented. It was originally created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. One of the most important features of Java is that it is cross-platform, with a large number of systems having been written in Java. There are also a large number of third-party libraries available, making it an appealing option for many businesses. The language has a long history and has been used for creating a variety of applications, though it is particularly well suited to developing apps for computer networks. In the smartphone market, Java is mostly used for developing apps for Android. The language has a large and active developer community and is often chosen due to its simplicity and flexibility.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and was created by JetBrains, the same company behind the IDE tool IntelliJ. This language was designed to be a more modern version of Java — Kotlin compiles to bytecode, just like Java. It is a functional programming language, which means that every part of the program is a function. This makes it easier to create lightweight code that is easier to read and maintain. Kotlin was first released in 2011 and was developed by programmers who were tired of the verbosity and complexity of Java. Due to the fact that Android apps are primarily written in Java, developers who wanted to create Android apps more easily often turned to Kotlin. The language was officially supported by Google in 2017.

## Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be applied to a multitude of different tasks, including mobile app development for Android. It is a widely used language that is simple, concise, and easy to read. Python is a versatile language that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. It runs on any computer system, has no restrictions on who can use it, and is open-source. One of the benefits of using Python for Android app development is that it can be used together with other frameworks and tools to make it more efficient. It is also easy to understand, even for people who have never worked with programming before.

## HTML5 and CSS3

HTML5 and CSS3 are essential for designing mobile apps. These languages make it possible for developers to design apps that can run on any device, regardless of the operating system or browser being used. These languages let you design full-featured apps that include animations, games, and other interactive content.

## Final Words: Wrapping Up

As you can see, there are many different programming languages that you can use to create mobile apps. You can choose any language that you’re most comfortable with, but make sure it will work on the platform(s) you’re targeting. For example, if you choose Swift, you’ll need to make sure your app is also available on Android. If you want to launch your app on the widest possible audience, it makes sense to choose a language that is used on both iOS and Android.
