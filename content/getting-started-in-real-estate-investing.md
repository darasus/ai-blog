## What is Real Estate Investing?

Real estate investing is the process of using real estate to make money. There are a lot of different ways to make money in the real estate industry, and it’s been a popular source of income since the beginning of time. In fact, even your grandparents or great-grandparents likely got their start in this industry.
Real estate investing can be broken down into two core concepts:

- Acquiring real estate - Owning real estate for any of a variety of reasons, such as to generate income from tenants, to use the property as collateral for a loan, or to sell it at a later date for a profit.

- Managing real estate - Acting as a real estate property manager by finding tenants to lease the property from you and keeping up with the logistics of the property once it’s under your control.

## Types of Real Estate Investments

There are many different ways to get started investing in real estate. Depending on your experience, skill level, and financial situation, you may want to start with something less risky. Once you get your feet wet, you can move towards more advanced investments as you become more comfortable with the process.

## Real Estate Investment Strategies

Buy and Hold Real Estate Investment Strategy - This is the most traditional way to invest in real estate and is a great option for beginners. When you buy and hold real estate, you’re purchasing a property and then holding onto it until the end of its natural lifespan. You’re not flip the property or resell it at a profit. Instead, you’re renting the property out to tenants to generate an ongoing stream of income.

You’ll want to make sure to choose a property that has strong rental potential and is in a good neighborhood so you can find tenants quickly and easily. Once you find a good rental property, you can then use the rental income to cover your monthly mortgage payment and start building equity.

Rehabilitation Strategy - This real estate investment strategy involves purchasing a property that has gone into disrepair. You can then fix up the property and sell it for a profit. Depending on the state of the property when you buy it, this strategy can be very high-risk.
When buying a property that requires rehabilitation, it’s important to choose a property that is both profitable and relatively safe. Ideally, you want to look for properties that require only minor repairs or a short-term renovation project.

Flipping Strategy - This is one of the riskiest real estate investment strategies you can use. With this strategy, you purchase a property and then resell it at a profit as quickly as possible. When you’re flipping a property, you want to get in and out as quickly as possible so that you can minimize your risk of loss.
You’ll want to look for properties that are in demand in your area but are being sold at a discounted rate. Ideally, you’ll want to purchase properties that are in need of minor renovations. This way, you can resell the property for a profit even if it requires a short renovation project.

Equity Strategies - This is one of the most advanced real estate investment strategies, but it can be very lucrative if you know what you’re doing. With this investment strategy, you purchase a property that is worth more than what you pay for it. The extra equity in the property is yours to keep and can be used to invest in other properties or generate an income stream.

You can also use this extra equity to create a cash-out refinance on your property. This will allow you to receive a large lump sum of cash and use that money to invest in other properties or generate an income stream.

## Conclusion

Real estate investing is a great way to earn passive income and create a reliable source of long-term wealth. There are many different types of real estate investments, so you can choose the one that is right for you. Getting started in real estate investing is easier than you might think. All you need to do is pick an investment strategy, research various properties, and make the right investment.
