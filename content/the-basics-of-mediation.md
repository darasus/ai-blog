Mediation is a process in which two or more parties attempt to reach a resolution to their dispute through the use of a neutral third party. The mediator does not make decisions for the parties, but rather facilitates communication and assists the parties in reaching their own agreement.

Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of all types, including those involving family, business, community, and legal issues. The process is confidential and often less formal than arbitration or litigation. Mediation can take place in person, by telephone, or online.

The first step in mediation is usually an opening statement from the mediator, who will explain the process and the ground rules that will govern the discussion. The mediator may also provide information about the issue at hand and ask each party to state their position. The parties then have an opportunity to ask questions and make statements.

The mediator will help the parties identify areas of agreement and disagreement, and will encourage them to brainstorm possible solutions. The mediator may also offer suggestions for resolving the dispute. The parties are free to accept or reject any proposal made by the mediator.

If an agreement is reached, the mediator will assist the parties in drafting a written agreement that includes all of the terms of the settlement. If no agreement is reached, the mediator will declare an impasse and the parties will be free to pursue other options, such as arbitration or litigation.
