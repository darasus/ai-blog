## What is mandatory mediation?

Mandatory mediation occurs when a contract or state law requires parties to certain types of disputes to try mediation before proceeding to litigation. In most states, mediation is mandatory in disputes involving real estate, divorce, and child custody. In some states, mediation is also required in cases involving contracts, probate, insurance, landlord-tenant disputes, and securities and investment fraud.
Some states have implemented mandatory mediation in order to reduce the amount of court cases and the expenses incurred by these parties in the court system. This is done by requiring the parties to pursue mediation before they decide to take their case to the courtroom. This helps to save a lot of time, money, and resources that could be better spent on something else.

## What is voluntary mediation?

Voluntary mediation is a process in which the parties involved in a dispute come to a mutual agreement without intervention from a third party such as a judge. The parties involved in a resolution process such as mediation often feel more satisfied with the outcome of the situation as opposed to being forced into a decision that didn’t satisfy both parties.
Voluntary mediation is often chosen by people in relationships such as business partners, spouses, family members, or neighbors. In these instances, it is often the best way to bring the parties together to discuss the issues in a relaxed environment. It is often more beneficial to do mediation as opposed to going to court because it is less expensive and it doesn’t require a third party to make a decision. This means that the two parties can talk and discuss the situation as opposed to having a judge make the decision for them.

## How does mediation work?

The mediator acts as a third party that facilitates discussion between the parties involved in a dispute. The mediator does not take a side and does not make a decision on the matter. Instead, he/she listens to each party and helps them come to a conclusion based on the information provided by both sides. The mediator does not give out advice, but rather facilitates a discussion between the two parties. The parties involved in the mediation process need to come to an agreement themselves and nothing can be imposed on them. The mediator only provides assistance where necessary.
Mediation is a process that should take place over a few sessions. During each session, the mediator encourages the parties to exchange information, explore options, and clarify their positions and interests. The mediator is a neutral third party who helps the parties explore alternatives to resolve the dispute and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.
