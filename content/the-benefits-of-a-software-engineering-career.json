It\\u2019s not enough for a programming language to be perfect, complete and universal; if no one uses it, it\\u2019s useless. That\\u2019s why the design of any new programming language involves a lot of user research. The creators of Python \\u2014 an open-source general-purpose programming language first released in 1991 \\u2014 recognized from the start that if they were going to succeed, they needed to create a language that was accessible and appealing to a wide audience. And so, despite its many advanced features, Python remains transparent and straightforward, with syntax that directly addresses the needs and abilities of most programmers.\nRead on to learn more about this brilliant programming syntax and why you should take some time to get acquainted with Python today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
