  "summary": "With GraphQL, you can build a single API that can be accessed from a variety of clients. This means that, if your app uses a GraphQL API and another app has the same requirements, then you can reuse the same API. This cuts down development time, reduces costs, and improves the overall quality of your app. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and it's easier for developers to document their code and standardize their documentation. You can use the Apollo GraphQL client to build GraphQL server in Android, Swift, Java, and React Native.",

It allows you to fetch data from a single endpoint, which makes it easy to build applications.

You decide to use GraphQL as the data layer to power this new app. Since GraphQL is a single API, you don\\u2019t have to create a new endpoint or change the existing one.

The app lets guests book rooms, check out their reservations, and manage their account.
