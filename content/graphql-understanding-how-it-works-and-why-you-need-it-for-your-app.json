Go is designed with simplicity and concurrency in mind and is known for its powerful type system. Go compiles to machine code that runs as fast as a program written in C or C++. The language is extremely fast as it compiles down to native code and can run on a wide range of computer systems. Go has great error handling and is easy to read, write, and understand the code.",
