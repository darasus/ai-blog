summary: Foster the People's new album is reminiscent of classic rock bands like
  Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. Artists often write about the things they
  experienced in their youth, so it makes sense that your artistic career is
  shaped by your formative years. When you're writing songs, you’re likely to
  explore what you were experiencing during that time. It’s healthy for artists
  to push their own boundaries, and artists who want to experiment with new
  sounds should consider releasing their music independently – this will allow
  you to fully explore your creative vision.
intro: >-
  New music comes with a lot of baggage. These days, when an artist
  releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their
  previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists
  going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released
  old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their
  youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last
  record and returned to their emo roots. 

  Whether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what’t clear is that there’s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they’ve done before. In fact, it can be incredibly exciting when musicians dig into who they were as teenagers, young adults and beyond.

  If you need convincing, just take a listen to Foster the People’s latest album – ‘Sacred Hearts Club’ – which is Led Zeppelin meets Weezer with hints of Pink Floyd and other psychedelic influences. Here are five reasons why this LP is proof positive that going back home is the perfect way for any artist to get inspired again.

## Nostalgia can be a beautiful thing.

When nostalgia becomes a creative fuel, it’s a beautiful thing. This is especially true for artists who revisit the music of their youth. Many artists – including Foster the People – first got their start in garage bands in their teens.
If you’re an artist seeking inspiration, it can be helpful to think back to your high school years. Foster the People’s album is reminiscent of classic rock bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. In fact, “Hustling” features a saxophone solo that sounds eerily similar to Pink Floyd’s “Money”. It might seem like a stretch, but artists like Pink Floyd and the Beatles have always served as inspiration for musicians. You might not be the next Zeppelin or Floyd, but you can certainly be inspired by them.


## It helps you reconnect with your youth.

When artists go back to their roots, they’re often reconnecting with the musical vision they had as a teenager. Artists often write about the things they experienced in their youth, so it makes sense that your artistic career is shaped by your formative years. When you’re writing songs, you’re likely to explore what you were experiencing during that time.

If you’re an artist who wants to get back to your roots, start by exploring what was going on in your life during that time. Foster the People’s album certainly reflects the band’s youth. The LP’s theme is tied to the California license plate “SLOMO” – a reference to the band’s time spent in Los Angeles. It’s possible that the band members were inspired by their experiences living in the city, which brings us back to the previous point.


## Sometimes going back to the basics is exactly what you need.

If you find yourself in a creative rut, consider taking a step back and simplifying your process. For example, make a list of your favorite artists in the world, and ask yourself why you’re a fan. This can help you engage with your core audience.

Foster the People's list of influences for this album include Pink Floyd and Weezer. At their core, these artists are great songwriters. The best way to get back to the basics is to focus on your craft and come up with a bunch of killer songs.

If you want to get back to the basics but aren’t sure where to start, try writing lyrics without the music. This will help you identify what you’re really feeling. You can then take these emotions and use them to create music.


## It’s healthy for artists to push their own boundaries.

When artists go back to their roots, they’re often looking to push their boundaries. We’re all familiar with the saying, “If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” But in this case, it might be exactly what you need.
When Foster the People released their debut album in 2011, the music was very accessible. The album was heavy on pop, alternative and dance sounds. The band’s new album, ‘Sacred Hearts Club’, is much more experimental. Tracks like “Pay the Man” are multi-layered and heavy on psychedelic sounds.

When artists push their own boundaries, there’s a good chance listeners will respond. Artists who want to experiment with new sounds should consider releasing their music independently – this will allow you to fully explore your creative vision.


## You’ll have a whole new set of tools to work with.

When artists go back to their roots, they often discover they now have a whole new set of tools to work with. The best way to put this into practice is to start listening to music that inspired your favourite artists, but also look at the artists who were inspired by those artists.
This is a cyclical process that can help you get inspired and create something new. Foster the People has done just that. Take the track “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy” and the track “Fireflies” by Owl City. These songs are very similar to “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy”, and both songs were written and released before “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy”.

You might not be able to create an album as thematically and sonically consistent as ‘Sacred Hearts Club’, but you can certainly pull a few tricks from Foster the People’s playbook.


## You’ll discover your core listeners respond to most.

When artists go back to their roots, they’re often looking for inspiration. But along the way, they might discover that their core listeners respond to something specific in their music. This could be anything from a particular melody to an element of your lyrics.
When Foster the People created their debut album, they knew they wanted certain songs to be singles. The band even used click tracks to make sure they hit the beats they wanted. But on their new album, they displayed a certain level of spontaneity.

For example, the track “Pay the Man” begins with an improvised saxophone solo. It’s possible that the band members were inspired by their youth and wanted to experiment. If this is the case, it’s possible that your core listeners respond to your experimentation. And that’s a good thing! It means you’re staying true to yourself.
