## A brief history of Foster the People

Foster the People began life in 2009 when Mark Foster, a well-known songwriter, decided to form a band and take a stab at performing his own material. The group’s first two albums, 2011’s "Torches" and 2014’s "Supermodel," are heavily influenced by Foster’s love of early-’80s new wave and synth-pop.
At the time, Foster was struggling with alcohol addiction and a host of mental health issues. He credited these two albums — along with the band’s extensive touring — with helping him to turn his life around. In 2016, Foster published an autobiography titled "Pipe Dreams: A Blunt-Hedged Search for Something Meaningful." In it, he describes his journey from a troubled childhood to becoming a successful musician.

## Mark Foster’s mission to find himself

Foster the People seemed determined to move in a new direction with its third album. The band members have spoken about how they wanted to experiment with new sounds and break free of any preconceived notions of who they are as artists. Unfortunately, they seem more fixated on escaping their past than finding their future.

It almost feels like they’re trying to find themselves by not being themselves. This is a shame, since Foster the People’s early work was a breath of fresh air in a music scene that was growing increasingly monotonous. You could always rely on them to put together a collection that sounded like nothing else.
That doesn’t happen on "Sacred Hearts Club." Instead, it sounds a bit like Foster the People threw a dart at a board covered in genres and tried to make whatever landed in their wheelhouse.

## The problem with genre-bending

On paper, genre-bending has plenty of potential to yield exciting results. It allows you to try new things and push the boundaries of your creative expression. You can take bits and pieces from your favorite genres and blend them together to create something fresh and new.
But the problem with genre-bending is that you can’t just throw a bunch of things into a blender and expect them to come out tasting good. You need to know how to use these ingredients properly. Otherwise, you’re just making a big, messy mess.

## “Pay the Rent”: Fostering nostalgia for a time you didn’t live through

The album’s lead single, “Pay the Rent,” is a prime example of how Foster the People is trying way too hard to be something they aren’t. The song features an abundance of ’80s-inspired sounds and references to the music of that decade. However, these references almost feel like a cynical attempt to cash in on nostalgia.
Foster the People’s music has always had a retro vibe to it. But these songs have always felt genuine, as if these guys were genuinely nostalgic for a specific time period.
That nostalgia is evident in songs like “Pumped Up Kicks” and “Ask Yourself.” These tracks are filled with ’80s references but are still able to stand on their own.

## “Loyalty”: An anthem that falls flat

The album’s second single, “Loyalty,” is a big, brash, stadium-rock-inspired number. It basically tries to do a better job of what Foster the People did so well on their previous releases. Unfortunately, the band’s attempt to emulate the sound they’ve always loved comes across as forced and contrived.
Foster the People’s third album is at its best when the band is doing what it does best. Unfortunately, "Sacred Hearts Club" is chock-full of songs that sound like the band is trying to do something else.

## “III”: A song that goes out of its way to be weird and miss the mark

The album’s bizarre title track is another example of the band going out of its way to be something it’s not. “Sacred Hearts Club” is a jarring, noisy, electro-rap track that sounds like a bad mixtape mash-up. It’s as if someone spliced together the worst bits of a dozen different songs.
The song feels as though it has no real direction or meaning behind it. It’s a track that just goes out of its way to be weird.

## “Huckleberry”: One bright spot in an otherwise forgettable tracklist

The album’s penultimate track, “Huckleberry,” is one of the few true Foster the People songs on "Sacred Hearts Club." It has the same breezy, carefree feel as songs like “Pumped Up Kicks” and “Houdini.”
Foster the People’s music has always been a welcome break from the monotonous sounds of mainstream radio. Unfortunately, that’s a break that this album doesn’t provide.

## Summing up

"Sacred Hearts Club" is a disappointing follow-up to Foster the People’s earlier work. It feels like the band is trying too hard to reinvent itself and change its identity. This is unfortunate, since their best work has always been when they’ve let their unique style shine through.

If you’re looking for an album that is fun, energetic, and doesn’t take itself too seriously, then "Sacred Hearts Club" is the album for you. It’s a catchy and enjoyable listen, but it just doesn’t compare to Foster the People’s earlier work.
