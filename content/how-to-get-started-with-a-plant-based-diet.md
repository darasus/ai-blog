## What You Need To Know Before Going Plant-Based

It’s important to note that going plant-based isn’t the same as eating a healthy plant-based diet. 
Following a plant-based diet means choosing whole, unprocessed foods that are naturally rich in nutrients and fibre. It means eating real, whole foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and spices.

However, many people who eat a 100% plant-based diet consume an unbalanced amount of carbohydrates and fibre while not getting enough protein and vitamins from plants. 
That’s because it’s very easy to fall into the trap of eating mostly refined carbohydrates like bread and pasta, which aren’t the best sources of nutrients.

## Where To Start?

You can begin by eliminating animal products from your diet one at a time. Alternatively, you can dive in headfirst by going “cold turkey” and cutting out all animal products at once.
If you want to take it slow, start by replacing one product a week with a plant-based alternative. For example, you can start replacing your milk with non-dairy milks, your cheese with vegan cheese, and your eggs with tofu or nutritional yeast.
