summary: Java Application Testing is the most difficult, yet most critical part
  of software development. Testing your Java applications is recommended since
  it helps cut down on the number of bugs in your software. It also helps you
  release secure products into production faster by catching bugs before your
  customers do. Modern software is heavily dependent on third-party services,
  APIs, and libraries, which makes it difficult to predict all the scenarios
  that will be executed when users interact with your software, such as using
  third party services and libraries. Tests are primarily written in Java,
  though other programming languages are supported as well.
intro: >-
  Today’s digital landscape is fast-paced, ever-changing, and steeped in
  digital transformations. Businesses are leveraging cloud services to
  accelerate their time to market, improve agility and lower costs. 

  Moreover, with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, IoT, and other advanced technologies enabling businesses to harness big data for predictive insights and automated processes—the moment has never been more opportune for businesses to leverage these transformative technologies.

  That’s why testing your Java applications is so important. A software tester conducts tests to evaluate the quality of software or website features by giving users different possible inputs and measuring the outputs against a pre-determined expectation. Software testers attempt to find bugs before your users do. They are like Quality Control for software development. Their job is to make sure that every piece of code meets its functional specifications, whether it’s user authentication or any other feature of your application.

  If you have not started testing your Java applications yet, we suggest you start soon!

## Why Is Java Application Testing Important?

All software has bugs. It’s a fact of life. And different software has different rates of bugs. It is a fact I am not thrilled to acknowledge.
Any industry study about software testing would show that testing is the most difficult, yet most critical part of software development.
For business-critical software, it is even more important.
You might be starting to see the pattern here. Business-critical software, or in other words, software that is mission-critical and plays a critical role in your business, needs to be tested extensively.
That’s why testing your Java applications is so important.

## What is Unit Testing?

You’re probably familiar with the term “reduce”. Unit testing is all about reducing bugs and errors in your code base.
Unit testing is done on a segment of code or module and validates its functionality without the need for a complete application. It’s a method used to test individual units of code.
Unit tests are primarily written and executed by developers. They are automated and executed by a continuous integration server as part of the build process.
Unit tests are primarily written in Java, though other programming languages are supported as well.
Unit test frameworks include JUnit, TestNG and Mockito.

## What is an Integration Test?

Integration testing focuses on testing and validating the integration of two or more components or modules of an application. If your application is made up of integrated components, like separate modules, services and APIs, then you need to perform integration testing. Integration tests are focused on validating the communication between the various modules, such that when the data is transferred, you can be sure it is accurate.
Integration testing is performed at the unit and API level. It validates that the API calls are being executed as planned by the API client or API test case. It also validates that the API server is functioning as expected by the API test case.
The results of the integration test are integrated with the unit test results to create a complete test report.

## What is a Functional Test?

Functional testing verifies that the application does what it is supposed to do.
Functional testing checks if the user can perform the required tasks with the application. It validates that all the functionality of the application is working as expected.
Functional testing is performed by testers and requires a detailed test plan and test cases.
Functional testing is done by using a wide range of automated tools and methodologies, including Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), User Interface Testing (UIT) and Load/Stress Testing.

## To Conclude

Testing your Java applications is recommended since it helps cut down on the number of bugs in your software. It also helps you release secure products into production faster by catching bugs before your customers do.

If you want to deliver high-quality software, you need to make sure that it works as expected. And for that, you need to conduct a thorough testing process. Modern software is heavily dependent on third-party services, APIs, and libraries, which makes it difficult to predict all the scenarios that will be executed when users are interacting with your software.

However, by testing your Java applications, you can increase the likelihood of identifying and resolving issues before you release your software.
