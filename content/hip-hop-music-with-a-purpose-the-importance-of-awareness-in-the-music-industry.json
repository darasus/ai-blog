The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer.

However, that doesn\\u2019t mean there hasn\\u2019t been some brilliant albums released so far this year. While last year had some incredible albums (like Kendrick Lamar\\u2019s \\u201CDamn,\\u201D Lorde\\u2019s \\u201CMelodrama,\\u201D and Noel Gallagher\\u2019s High Flying Birds' \"Who Built the Moon?\"), this year hasn\\u2019t quite matched up to those standards. However, we are only halfway through the year and as such, we have also seen some fantastic new albums released in the last few months that are worth mentioning. There may not be many great new albums out at the moment \\u2013 but these five are definitely among the best.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Films like \\u201CMad Max\\u201D and \\u201CThe Road Warrior\\u201D were cautionary tales about the future of mankind brought on by a series of devastating natural and man-made disasters; \"Mad Max\" being set during a prolonged drought, and \"The Road Warrior\" taking place after a catastrophic failure of an oil refinery leads to widespread pollution and destruction as well as a shortage of gasoline (which is what inspired the term \\u201CRoad Warrior\\u201D).\nIn these movies, there are also factions that have arisen to take advantage of these new conditions: In \"Mad Max\", we see gangs whose primary function is to steal fuel from other scavenger tribes; In \"The Road Warrior\", we see roving bands that are essentially highwaymen that prey upon small towns using their road-warrior combat skillset; And in both movies we see heroes who fight against evil not because they want to be evil but because they are good people trying to save those they love in terrible times.\nThese subtexts have been explored time and time again throughout history through literature such as The Bible`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
