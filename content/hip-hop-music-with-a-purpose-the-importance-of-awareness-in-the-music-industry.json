Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons \\u2014 which we\\u2019ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.\nRead on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
