intro: >-
  When you purchase a mutual fund, you typically pay an upfront cost (or
  load) and annual fees. These are known as "loads" because they reduce your
  return. A no-load fund has no upfront or hidden costs. These mutual funds have
  a small initial investment requirement, which may be as little as $50.

  These funds have other characteristics that make them different from those with load fees: No-load mutual funds generally don’t charge commissions or sales fees. They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public. There are no broker incentives like sales targets or bonus payments for selling certain shares.

## What you should know before buying a no-load fund

A no-load fund is a mutual fund that doesn’t charge a sales fee, known as a "load." Loads generally come in two forms: front-end loads and deferred loads.
Front-end loads are charged when you purchase the fund. They are often 5% or higher and go to the investment advisor who sells the fund to you.
Deferred loads are paid when you sell your shares in the fund. They are typically smaller—typically between 1% and 5%.

Deferred loads are sometimes called back-end loads and are common in mutual funds offered by financial services companies.
Front-end loads are usually avoided because they reduce the return you earn on the investment. Deferred loads are sometimes accepted because they are more likely to be a smaller amount.
Front-end loads are usually charged when you buy a mutual fund, while deferred loads are deducted when you sell the fund.

## No-load funds in your portfolio

No-load funds are easy for you to purchase and manage. You don’t need to spend a lot of time researching investment options or reading prospectuses. You don’t need to worry about paying a sales fee or keeping track of investment performance. No-load funds are investible - you can put them in any portfolio. You can put them in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s. No-load funds are liquid - you can sell them whenever you want. No-load funds are professionally managed by a team of analysts.

## Are no-load mutual funds right for you?

- If you’re not interested in researching investment options: No-load funds are easy to purchase, and you don’t need to research investment options.
- If you want a low-maintenance portfolio: No-load funds are easy to manage. You don’t need to closely monitor your investment portfolio.
- If you like diversification: No-load funds are a good way to diversify your portfolio.
- If you have a 529 plan for college savings: No-load funds are a low-maintenance way to build your portfolio.
- If you have a 401(k) and want to choose your own investments: No-load funds can be a good option. You could choose mutual funds that are similar to the pre-selected options offered by your plan.
- If you want tax-efficiency: No-load funds are generally tax-efficient because they don’t allow investors to sell shares often.
- If you want ongoing management: No-load funds are actively managed by a professional investment team.

## The downsides of no-load mutual funds

- If you want to choose your own investments: You must be willing to research and manage your own investments.
- If you want to manage your own risk: You must be willing to closely monitor your investments for signs of risk.
- If you have a defined-benefit plan: No-load funds aren’t likely to be on the pre-selected list of investment options.
- If you have a small portfolio: No-load funds may not offer a sufficient number of investment options.
- If you have a large portfolio: No-load funds might not offer enough diversification.
- If you have a short time horizon: No-load funds might not have time to recover from a market downturn.
- If you want to minimize taxes: No-load funds might not be the best option because they don’t allow investors to sell shares often.
- If you want fund liquidity: No-load funds are not guaranteed to be available when you want to sell them.
- If you don’t want ongoing management: No-load funds are actively managed by investment teams.
- If you want help with financial planning: No-load funds might not offer any help with financial planning.
- If you want to avoid broker bias: No-load funds are bought and sold by investors, not brokers.
- If you want a second opinion: No-load funds are professionally managed.
- If you want a low cost: No-load funds are not necessarily inexpensive.
- If you want to invest in a specific company: No-load funds are not likely to invest in specific companies.

## Bottom line

No-load mutual funds are easy to purchase, are low-maintenance, and are professionally managed. However, they aren’t likely to offer as much diversification as mutual funds with loads, aren’t guaranteed to be available when you want to sell them, and might not be the best option if you want to minimize taxes or want ongoing management.
