## What is Cooking?

Cooking is the process of combining different ingredients to make something edible. People have been cooking for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of cooking with fire is a cave painting in Spain that is at least 40,000 years old. The first pots for cooking were made about 10,000 years ago in what is now India.

Any time you take one or more ingredients and transform them into something that is easier and/or more pleasant to eat, you are cooking. Cooking can be as simple as heating up a can of beans, or it can be as complex as baking a cake. Cooking is a skill that has many benefits. Cooking your own meals allows you to be in control of your food intake, it is usually better for your wallet, and it can be a fun and creative process!

## Plan your meals

The first and most important thing you need to do when learning how to cook is to pick an easy recipe and practice it a few times until you get it right. Once you know what works and what doesn’t, you can start experimenting with new recipes. Pick a recipe that you can make in one pot or pan, since you may not have many cooking utensils and pots/pans to work with.
If you’re in a survival situation and you’ve got to rely on whatever you can find, you’ll want to make sure that whatever you cook doesn’t require special tools. Some good choices are: oatmeal, porridge, rice, beans, granola, and soups. You can also try making a stew or a pot of chili; they’re simple, hearty meals that can feed a lot of people.

## The tools you’ll need to cook

You’ll need a few basic tools to get started cooking with very little. You can use pots, pans, a knife, a cutting board, and a few bowls for these.
Depending on what you’re making, you may also need a wooden spoon, a whisk, and a colander. If you’re cooking with fire, you’ll also need a pot holder, a lighter, and a pot stand.

## How to boil water

Boiling is one of the first things you should learn when you’re learning how to cook. What’s the use of cooking if you can’t even boil water? You can do many things with boiling water, such as cooking rice, oatmeal, grains, beans, and vegetables. You can also sterilize water, purify water, and make tea.

When learning how to boil water, make sure you are using a pot that is large enough to hold the water. You don’t want the water to overflow into your stove. After bringing the water to a boil, make sure you turn the heat down so that it doesn’t overflow. When the water is boiling, you can add your ingredients, but make sure they aren’t touching the sides.

## How to pan fry

Pan frying is a quick and easy way to cook your food on the stovetop in a pan. Pan frying is like shallow frying, but in a pan. You can pan fry almost anything, but it’s best for smaller, thinner items like eggs, sandwiches, and tortillas. 

Pan frying is best done over medium-high heat, but you can try it at lower heat to see what happens. When pan frying, you’ll need some oil or fat in the pan to keep your food from sticking. Some good choices are butter, oils, and non-stick spray.

## How to sauté

Sautéing is a quick way of cooking food in a small amount of fat in a pot or pan. It is similar to pan-frying, except it uses more fat and a higher temperature. It’s best for smaller pieces of vegetables, herbs, and softer foods.

When sautéing, you want a hot pan, so that the fat begins to sizzle right away. You also want to make sure your food isn’t touching the bottom of the pan, so that it can easily move around. You’ll need a little bit of fat in the pan, like oil or butter, to keep your food from sticking.

## How to roast

Roasting is a type of baking that uses high heat in an open oven. Roasting uses dry heat to cook food with a high temperature and a longer time. It is used for meat and vegetables, but not for other types of food.

When roasting something, you want to make sure you have enough space in the oven so that it can circulate properly and cook evenly. You may need to do multiple batches, depending on the size of your oven and the amount of food you want to roast.

## How to grill

Grilling is a dry-heat cooking method that uses direct heat to cook food. You place food on a grill over direct heat. Grills are usually out in the open, but you can also grill indoors on a stove or a grill that is specially made for indoor grilling.

When grilling, you want to make sure that the grill is clean and oiled so that the food doesn’t stick. You may also want to cover the grill to trap in the heat and keep the food warm until it is cooked.

## Summing up

Cooking is a skill that can save your life if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to rely on your own resources for food. Knowing how to cook can also help you save money, be healthier, and have more control over your diet.

The best way to learn how to cook is to pick an easy recipe and practice it until you get it right. You can also try to combine different techniques to create something new. Cooking is an art form, so you can really get creative with it!
