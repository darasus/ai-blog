This could include individuals who are new to investing or those who are seeking a low-cost investment strategy.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Passive investors also tend to have a long-term perspective on the market, which may be considered contrarian in today\\u2019s fast-moving, algorithm-driven trading environment. Passive investors hold their investment positions for an extended period of time, often for years or even decades, without feeling obligated to make frequent adjustments. They\\u2019re less concerned with what\\u2019s happening today or even next week, and more interested in seeing how the market and their portfolio evolve over the long haul.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is index investing effective?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The basic idea behind index investing is that it\\u2019s a low-cost, low-effort way to track a broad, diversified basket of stocks.

That\\u2019s because, unlike actively managed funds, index funds are not paying hefty fees for a team of analysts to scour the market for the best stocks.\nThat\\u2019s money that gets added to your investment account.

The key is to pick one that you can commit to tracking over the long haul.\nThe basic rule of thumb is to pick an index that represents a good balance between risk and reward \\u2014 and one that fits your investing timeframe. A good rule of thumb is to start out with a broad-based index, such as the S&P 500, and then add a more focused index, such as a sector index, as you get more experienced with the strategy.\nFor example, the S&P 500 represents the American equity market and covers a broad selection of companies across industries.
