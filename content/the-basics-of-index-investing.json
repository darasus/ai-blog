The term passive investing is sometimes used interchangeably with index investing, though not all index funds are passive investments. A passive investment strategy is the opposite of an active investment strategy, where a portfolio is actively managed to meet goals such as capital appreciation, income, or preservation of capital.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Passive investing is typically used by investors who don\\u2019t have the time or expertise to actively manage their investments. This could include individuals who are new to investing or those who are seeking a low-cost investment strategy.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Passive investors also tend to have a long-term perspective on the market, which may be considered contrarian in today\\u2019s fast-moving, algorithm-driven trading environment. Passive investors hold their investment positions for an extended period of time, often for years or even decades, without feeling obligated to make frequent adjustments. They\\u2019re less concerned with what\\u2019s happening today or even next week, and more interested in seeing how the market and their portfolio evolve over the long haul.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is index investing effective?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The basic idea behind index investing is that it\\u2019s a low-cost, low-effort way to track a broad, diversified basket of stocks. Rather than attempt to pick individual stocks that will outperform, you simply buy into a diversified basket of stocks that, over time, is likely to outperform. That\\u2019s because, unlike actively managed funds, index funds are not paying hefty fees for a team of analysts to scour the market for the best stocks.\nThat\\u2019s money that gets added to your investment account. Moreover, actively managed funds tend to underperform the broader market because of the higher fees they incur.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Which indexes should you track?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`There are countless indexes you could choose to track, like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Russell 2000, or even commodities like oil or gold. The key is to pick one that you can commit to tracking over the long haul.\nThe basic rule of thumb is to pick an index that represents a good balance between risk and reward \\u2014 and one that fits your investing timeframe. A good rule of thumb is to start out with a broad-based index, such as the S&P 500, and then add a more focused index, such as a sector index, as you get more experienced with the strategy.\nFor example, the S&P 500 represents the American equity market and covers a broad selection of companies across industries. Meanwhile, the Financial Select Sector Index represents the financial services industry, which includes banks, investment firms, and insurance companies.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The pros and cons of index investing\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Index investing has a number of advantages over actively managed portfolios, including reduced portfolio turnover and lower fees.\nThese advantages lead to a lower cost of investing, which can significantly improve your long-term investment outcomes.\nFor example, a recent academic study found that a portfolio of passively managed funds had a 99% probability of outperforming an actively managed portfolio over a 10-year period.\nMoreover, the study showed that passively managed portfolios have a 99% probability of outperforming actively managed portfolios over any 10-year period.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to invest using an index\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`As we\\u2019ve seen, you can choose from a wide range of indexes to track. The first thing you should do is decide what type of investment you\\u2019d like to focus on \\u2014 such as stocks or bonds.\nThen, you can do some research to see which indexes represent that type of investment. You can find indexes tracked by companies such as Standard & Poor\\u2019s, MSCI, Russell, and Nasdaq.`),mdx(\"p\",null,`Once you\\u2019ve identified the indexes you want to track, the next step is to pick the best fund for your needs.
