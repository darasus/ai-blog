Passive investors hold their investment positions for an extended period of time, often for years or even decades, without feeling obligated to make frequent adjustments.

The key is to pick one that you can commit to tracking over the long haul.\nThe basic rule of thumb is to pick an index that represents a good balance between risk and reward \\u2014 and one that fits your investing timeframe. A good rule of thumb is to start out with a broad-based index, such as the S&P 500, and then add a more focused index, such as a sector index, as you get more experienced with the strategy.\nFor example, the S&P 500 represents the American equity market and covers a broad selection of companies across industries.

As a result, your average cost per share is lower than if you had invested the entire amount at once.\nAs an example, let\\u2019s assume an investor has $10,000 to invest in stocks and has been debating between two companies: ABC stock and XYZ stock. If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then. Hence the investor decides to dollar cost average by investing $5,000 today and another $5,000 10 days from now in order to invest the final $5,000 30 days from now \\u2013 spending an equal dollar amount each time ($2,500 per investment). This way they can reduce their risk as well as smooth out the peaks and troughs of their returns.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
