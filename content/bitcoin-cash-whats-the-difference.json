With a market capitalization of over $115 billion, Bitcoin has come a long way. But it is not without its problems. The prevalence of centralized exchanges and custodial services, as well as recent price manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users of the virtual currency.\nMoreover, with institutions, governments and individuals increasingly recognizing the value of digital tokens, crypto-anarchists are becoming concerned that Bitcoin may not be sufficiently anonymous to protect against intrusion from authorities or intermediaries (e.g., exchanges and data brokers). This has led to an increase in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies\\u2014 known as \\u2018privacy coins\\u2019\\u2014 like ZCash, Dash and Monero.\nThankfully, there is also a solution within this problem: Bitcoin Private (BTCP).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
