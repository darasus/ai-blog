The fork occurred when the Bitcoin blockchain was split in two after a majority of miners (the computers that keep the network running) voted to decide between two competing visions for the future of Bitcoin.\nBecause the Bitcoin network was only able to process a limited number of transactions per second, many believed that the Bitcoin blockchain was not suitable for mainstream adoption.\nBanks and other large institutions have begun investing heavily in blockchain technology in recent years. Many believe that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the global financial system significantly and reduce the costs of many services by as much as 28%.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"What is Bitcoin?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be \\u201Cmined\\u201D by computers. Bitcoin mining refers to the process of validating and confirming transactions on the network. In return for investing the computing power behind the network, miners are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins for each block they validate.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is the distributed ledger that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that store and validate all of the information.\nWhen you make a transaction using Bitcoin (either by sending, receiving, or purchasing), the information is sent to the blockchain and recorded as a public ledger.\nBecause the blockchain is public, anyone can see the transaction (as well as the amount, location, and other information related to the transaction).`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Difference Between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`The core difference between these two currencies is that Bitcoin Cash was created as a fork of Bitcoin to solve its scaling issues. What this means is that the Bitcoin Cash network has the ability to process a much larger number of transactions per second than Bitcoin.\nBecause of this, Bitcoin Cash is considered more scalable than Bitcoin and has a larger potential user base.\nAnother difference between the two is the size of their respective networks. Bitcoin is one of the most established cryptocurrencies, and its network is significantly larger than that of Bitcoin Cash.\nThe number of Bitcoin nodes (computers that store the blockchain) is estimated to be around 10,000, while the number of Bitcoin Cash nodes is about 10,000.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why did Bitcoin Cash fork?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the most common issues in cryptocurrency is that of scalability.

As the network grew, these issues became more and more prominent.\nThe Bitcoin network can process a maximum of seven transactions per second. In comparison, Visa, the most commonly used credit card payment network, can process 24,000 transactions per second.\nThis means that Bitcoin is not a viable solution for many businesses looking to use blockchain technology for their payment methods.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Where can I buy Bitcoin Cash?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`You can choose to purchase Bitcoin Cash through an intermediary exchange or through an investment fund.\nIf you use an intermediary exchange, you\\u2019ll be able to swap one type of coin for another.
