There is a general feeling that something big is about to happen. The Internet as we know it is changing, and new ways to use data are being invented every day. In this rapidly shifting landscape, blockchain technology stands out as one of the most disruptive innovations.\nBut what exactly is blockchain technology? In a nutshell, it\\u2019s a decentralized ledger that stores information in places called blocks. Whenever someone wants to add information or a transaction to the ledger, they first need to verify themselves by supplying proof of identity. Each block also has its own unique identifier known as a hash. These identifiers help track information easily without having to store an entire copy of each block, which reduces space significantly and speeds up data transfer speeds significantly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
