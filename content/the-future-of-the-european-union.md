intro: >-
  European Union (EU) integration has been on a rollercoaster ride. After
  the failure of the European Constitution in 2005, and following several years
  of financial crisis, EU institutions and member states have recommitted to
  strengthening the foundations of European integration. Indeed, a new wave of
  integration has emerged.

  In recent years, we have seen a renewed political will among EU member states to tackle common challenges together and further strengthen the European Union. The Paris Declaration on Integration and Human Rights; the Berlin Process on Security and Integration; the Malta Declaration on Social Compact and the Digital Future of Europe are all examples of this new phase of integration.

  We take a closer look at where Europe is heading with its various endeavours towards greater unity.

## European Union integration: Where do we go from here?

The EU has seen major changes in its composition and political dynamics over the past decade, while undergoing unprecedented challenges. Many have questioned whether it has a future, or even if it was worth pursuing. Indeed, the European project was under threat, but the European Union has rallied and is now stronger than ever.

The EU is more deeply integrated than ever before, with more cross-border collaboration on all policy areas, including economic, social and security issues. However, we have seen growing hostility to the project in recent years, with anti-EU sentiment and populist parties on the rise across Europe.

The future of the EU depends on how European leaders and EU institutions respond to these challenges over the coming years. There is a real opportunity to deepen the integration of the EU, with a renewed sense of political momentum and commitment among member states for strengthening the foundations of European integration.

## The EU's ongoing efforts to enhance integration

The European Union has always been a work in progress. The history of the EU project can be seen as an extended process of integration, with the process and the timeline constantly evolving and stretching in new directions.
The EU is facing unprecedented challenges today, but this is also an unprecedented opportunity to further deepen integration and bring about real change that can boost prosperity and security across the continent.

The Paris Declaration on Integration and Human Rights, the Berlin Process on Security and Integration, the Malta Declaration on Social Compact and the Digital Future of Europe are all examples of this new phase of integration. These initiatives show a new commitment to addressing common challenges together, and advancing the process of integration further.

## A European Defence Union

The EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) has been a work in progress for many years. European defence is an area where progress has been slow, but there are signs that this is changing.
Currently, EU member states are working towards establishing a European Defence Union by 2025. They aim to establish a common security and defence policy, with the goal of having a fully-integrated EU defence structure.
A defence union would strengthen EU relations with NATO, and help address security challenges across the bloc, such as the flow of migrants and increasing cyber threats. It would also help to ease the burden on national budgets and reduce duplication, while increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
A European Defence Fund has been set up to support investment in joint military projects, research and innovation in this area.

## A European Monetary Fund

The European Central Bank (ECB) has done a commendable job managing the financial crisis that hit the EU several years ago, but it is primarily a monetary policy institution. It is not equipped to deal with the fallout of economic crises, and has little oversight of macroeconomic policies in EMU member states.
A European Monetary Fund has been proposed as part of a “comprehensive investment strategy for Europe”. This would be a fund that would support member states experiencing economic difficulties and assist in resolving financial crises.
This would allow the ECB to focus on its monetary policy mandate and economic research. It could also help to streamline the European debt-resolution mechanism, allowing for a more coordinated response to crises and a faster resolution of problems.

## A European Transparency and Rule Enforcement Agency

The European Union faces many challenges, from the flow of migrants to the rise in populism, but one of the most pressing issues is a lack of transparency and accountability across EU institutions.
A European Transparency and Rule Enforcement Agency could help to bring more transparency to EU decision-making and reduce the distance between citizens and Brussels.
It would address a lack of clarity and trust in EU institutions, by providing more information about the activities of EU institutions and bringing together different EU agencies, such as the European Investment Bank, the European Medicines Agency, and the European Chemicals Agency, that play a role in citizens’ everyday lives, but are unknown to most people.

## Conclusion

The European Union has seen major changes in its composition and political dynamics over the past decade, while undergoing unprecedented challenges. The EU is more deeply integrated than ever before, with more cross-border collaboration on all policy areas, including economic, social, and security issues.

The European project was under threat, but the European Union has rallied and is now stronger than ever. There is a real opportunity to deepen the integration of the EU, with a renewed sense of political momentum and commitment among member states for strengthening the foundations of European integration.

The future of the EU depends on how European leaders and EU institutions respond to these challenges over the coming years. This new period of integration offers a real chance to address common challenges, enhance prosperity, and strengthen security across the continent.
