  "intro": "Have you ever sat through a game of Pandemic with your friends and just wanted to shake them? Or maybe you’ve played with people who were so scared of losing that they refused to take any risks? Perhaps you’ve been on the other side, acting like a jerk just to get your friend mad and force them to win.\nScrubs, control-freaks, cautious nerds— there are as many types of board gamers as there are games. It turns out there’s even more diversity than that. There are people who love word puzzles ( Codenames ), people who prefer their games fast and furious ( Smash Up ), and everyone in between.\nIf you know someone who loves Pandemic but isn’t so fond of losing, this list is for you. Here we have compiled some of the best strategy games released this year.",
  "content": "## Cavern Co-op\n\nCavern Co-op is a thematic, story-driven co-op game in which you and your team of “caver” buddies explore a dark and dangerous cave. Your goal is to collect crystals and escape the cave, but that’s easier said than done.\n\nThe catch is that you’re in a race against the clock. After an hour of play, you’ll hear an ominous rumble in the background. The “time bomb” is activated, and you have 30 minutes to finish the game before it blows up.\n\nThis is a great game for anyone who loves narrative-heavy games with high stakes. It’s easy to learn and plays well with 2-4 friends. Best of all, Cavern Co-op is extremely moddable. You can find tons of fan-made rule-changes and expansions online to keep this game fresh.\n\n## Tiny Epic Mechs\n\nTiny Epic Mechs is a game about building a team of super-powered heroes and taking on a team of evil robots. It’s a game about managing resources and making tough decisions. It’s a game about winning.\n\nThe game can be played with 2-4 people and only takes about 45 minutes. There’s a ton of value here for the price. Seriously, this game is tiny, but it’s also epic.\n\nSome people think that games should be easy to learn, but not at the expense of depth. This game can be played casually, but it’s also extremely competitive. The team at Game Covenant who created Tiny Epic Mechs really knows how to pack a punch in a tiny box.\n\n## The Bigger Game\n\nThe Bigger Game is a card game for 2-8 people that has you competing to build a bigger, better board game. You’ll add components, cards, and characters while trying to avoid getting “rowdy.”\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this game, and it’s incredibly challenging. However, it’s also tons of fun and can be played with a wide range of skill levels. You can even play completely cutthroat if you’re so inclined.\n\nThe Bigger Game can be a little goofy at times, but it’s also challenging and tons of fun. It’s a great game for larger groups, and it can also be played competitively if you’re so inclined. This is a game for board game nerds who like to have fun.\n\n## Broom Service: The Card Game\n\nBroom Service is a game about managing your staff and making sure there are enough witches and wizards available to keep your customers happy. It’s a game about resource management and carefully choosing how to spend your time and energy as a manager. It’s a game about winning.\n\nThis is a very different game from Tiny Epic Mechs, but they both have something to offer different types of gamers. Broom Service is simpler than Mechs, but it’s also more challenging. It’s a great card game for people who like to have something to think about when they play.\n\nLike Tiny Epic Mechs, Broom Service is tiny but packed with value. It’s a great game for people who are looking for something a little different from the standard deck building game. It’s a great game for people who like to have something to think about when they play.\n\n## Darkness Comes: A Game of Heroes and Skirmish\n\nDarkness Comes is a game of heroes, villains, and skirmishes. You’ll build a team of heroes (or villains) to skirmish against other players. What’s great about this game is that it can be played completely casually and cooperatively, or you can play to win.\n\nThis game is incredibly flexible, and it can be played with almost any group of friends. It’s a very easy game to learn and understand. Anyone who likes competition and cooperation will love this game.\n\nThis is a great game for people who want something accessible but with a lot of depth and variety. It’s also a great game for people who like fantasy and RPG themes.\n\n## Eclipse – The Codex RPG\n\nEclipse is a game about space exploration, diplomacy, and combat. It’s a game about managing your ship and crew as you try to survive an extremely dangerous galaxy. It’s a game about winning.\n\nEclipse is a very complex game, and it’s not for everyone. There are lots of rules and systems. However, if you’re a fan of sci-fi, you owe it to yourself to try this game. Eclipse is a very different type of game. It’s a great game for people who like a challenge and intrigue.\n\nThis is a great game for people who like complexity, sci-fi, and intrigue. It’s not the easiest game to learn, but the payoff is worth the effort. This is a great game for people who like a challenge and intrigue.\n\n## Munchkin Adventure Time 2 – Be More and DO More!\n\nMunchkin is a very silly game about being the first person to get ten “levels” and defeat the “bad guy.” It’s a game about bluffing, cheating, and being outrageously over the top. It’s a game about winning.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to play a game where you can team up with friends to take down monstrous rats while also stealing their stuff and stabbing them in the back, then Munchkin is for you. This game is stupid, but it’s also tons of fun.\n\nThis is a great game for people who are interested in tabletop games but are a little too concerned with being serious to try them. Munchkin is definitely a gateway drug.\n\nIf you’re interested in trying out some new games, we hope this article will be helpful in finding the experience that’s right for you."
