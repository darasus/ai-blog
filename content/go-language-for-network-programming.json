They are compiled and designed to be very efficient at accessing computer hardware. This makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including networking.\nC and C++ are also known for being very low-level programming languages. This means that the source code can be very difficult to read for those who are new to programming. Additionally, this low-level design can make the source code susceptible to security issues.\nC and C++ are the most powerful programming languages on this list.
