They are compiled and designed to be very efficient at accessing computer hardware. This makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including networking.\nC and C++ are also known for being very low-level programming languages. This means that the source code can be very difficult to read for those who are new to programming. Additionally, this low-level design can make the source code susceptible to security issues.\nC and C++ are the most powerful programming languages on this list.

This makes Node.js applications very efficient and scalable.\nNode.js is a very powerful programming language that is used by a wide range of companies, from small startups to tech giants like PayPal and Netflix. This popularity is due to its high performance when used for network applications.\nNode.js is also one of the easiest programming languages to learn on this list.
