summary: When a dog is overtired, their body produces an excess of cortisol, a
  hormone that tells the body to shut down and prepare for rest. High levels of
  cortisol can take a serious toll on the health of your dog. A dog who’s
  consistently overtired can even develop depression, which is a serious health
  problem in and of itself. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog, and a healthy
  dose of exercise can help tire them out both physically and mentally so they
  can sleep better at night.
intro: >-
  Dogs are energetic and inquisitive creatures. It’s great that they want
  to explore the world around them and make new discoveries every day, but what
  isn’t so great is when they keep you up at night with their shenanigans. Doggy
  antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through
  the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your
  pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive
  on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and
  physical health. 

  If you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it’s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company. Fortunately, training your dog to go to bed is fairly easy with some dedication from you!

## What’s so bad about dogs staying up all night?

The biggest issue with dogs who are unable or unwilling to go to bed is that they start to get grumpy and antisocial. They’ll become moody, anxious, and irritable, and have a much harder time getting along with the humans and animals around them.
When a dog is overtired, their body produces an excess of cortisol, a hormone that tells the body to shut down and prepare for rest. Overtime, high levels of cortisol can take a serious toll on the health of your dog. Some of the many problems caused by over-exposure to cortisol are:
A dog who’s consistently overtired can even develop depression, which is a serious health problem in and of itself. A dog who’s depressed may sleep more often and have less interest in daily activities. Depression can be treated with medication, but the best way to avoid it is to keep your dog healthy in the first place.

## How to train your dog to go to bed

There are lots of different ways to teach your dog to go to bed, but a classic method that works for most dogs is the “controlled associate” exercise.

- Associate Something Good With Going To Bed
- Make Going To Bed A Rewarding Behavior
- Don’t Give In When Your Dog Escapes
- Be Consistent And Don’t Give Up!

## Final Words

All dogs are individuals, so how your dog responds to these techniques will vary. Some dogs might need more time to learn than others, but with a little patience and dedication, every dog can learn to go to bed!

If your dog is struggling to adapt to a more regimented sleeping schedule, there’s a chance they’re experiencing some anxiety. Dogs with anxiety often need help from a certified trainer or vet to learn to manage the stress of living with humans.

For many dogs, the best bedtime routine includes a healthy dose of exercise. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog, and a healthy dose of exercise can help tire them out both physically and mentally so they can sleep better at night.
