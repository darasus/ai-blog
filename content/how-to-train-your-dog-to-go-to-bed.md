## What’s so bad about dogs staying up all night?

The biggest issue with dogs who are unable or unwilling to go to bed is that they start to get grumpy and antisocial. They’ll become moody, anxious, and irritable, and have a much harder time getting along with the humans and animals around them.
When a dog is overtired, their body produces an excess of cortisol, a hormone that tells the body to shut down and prepare for rest. Overtime, high levels of cortisol can take a serious toll on the health of your dog. Some of the many problems caused by over-exposure to cortisol are:
A dog who’s consistently overtired can even develop depression, which is a serious health problem in and of itself. A dog who’s depressed may sleep more often and have less interest in daily activities. Depression can be treated with medication, but the best way to avoid it is to keep your dog healthy in the first place.

## How to train your dog to go to bed

There are lots of different ways to teach your dog to go to bed, but a classic method that works for most dogs is the “controlled associate” exercise.

- Associate Something Good With Going To Bed
- Make Going To Bed A Rewarding Behavior
- Don’t Give In When Your Dog Escapes
- Be Consistent And Don’t Give Up!

## Final Words

All dogs are individuals, so how your dog responds to these techniques will vary. Some dogs might need more time to learn than others, but with a little patience and dedication, every dog can learn to go to bed!

If your dog is struggling to adapt to a more regimented sleeping schedule, there’s a chance they’re experiencing some anxiety. Dogs with anxiety often need help from a certified trainer or vet to learn to manage the stress of living with humans.

For many dogs, the best bedtime routine includes a healthy dose of exercise. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog, and a healthy dose of exercise can help tire them out both physically and mentally so they can sleep better at night.
