Assuming you would like tips on teaching your dog to go to bed: 

1. Start by establishing a bedtime routine. This could involve giving your dog a final potty break, feeding them their last meal of the day, and/or brushing their teeth. Doing the same things in the same order each night will help your dog understand that it’s time to go to bed.

2. Make sure your dog has a comfortable place to sleep. This could be a dog bed, crate, or even just a spot on your bed or couch.

3. Once you’ve established a bedtime routine, begin to teach your dog the “go to bed” command. You can do this by pointing to their bed and saying “go to bed” in a firm, yet gentle voice. You may need to give them a little nudge towards their bed if they don’t seem to understand what you want them to do.

4. Once your dog is in their bed, give them lots of praise and a treat. It’s important that they associate going to bed with something positive.

5. If your dog gets up from their bed, simply say “no” and lead them back to their bed. Again, praise and treat them when they obey the command.

6. Be patient and consistent with your training. Like with most things in life, learning how to go to bed takes time and practice. But if you’re consistent with your commands and rewards, your dog will eventually get the hang of it.
