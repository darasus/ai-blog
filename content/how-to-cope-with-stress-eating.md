When it comes to stress eating, there are a few things you can do to help cope with it. First, try to identify the triggers that lead to your stress eating. Once you know what triggers your stress eating, you can then work on avoiding or removing those triggers from your life. Secondly, make sure you're getting enough sleep and exercise. Both of these help to reduce stress levels and can make it easier to resist the urge to stress eat. Lastly, try to find other ways to cope with stress that don't involve food. This could include things like talking to a friend, listening to music, or taking a relaxing bath. If you find yourself struggling to cope with stress in a healthy way, it may be worth talking to a doctor or therapist who can help you develop a more effective plan.
