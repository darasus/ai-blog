intro: >-
  In a world where cyberattacks are increasingly frequent and data breaches
  now make headlines on a near-daily basis, trust in digital intermediaries has
  hit an all-time low. Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming
  increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential
  information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for
  cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there
  has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and
  sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity. 

  To that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server. Furthermore, we’ll discuss why blockchain technology is particularly well suited to meet this challenge with enhanced security measures and increased transparency.

## Blockchain Basics

The foundation of blockchain technology is a decentralized network of computers that securely stores data in a manner that ensures confidentiality and integrity. This is achieved by first isolating the data in question, and then securing it with strong encryption algorithms and logging the data’s provenance.
To secure the data, the blockchain network uses a distributed ledger, which is an immutable record that keeps track of all transactions and data transfers that have ever been executed. The distributed ledger used in blockchain technology is distributed across thousands of computers that are geographically dispersed. This arrangement ensures that no single computer or entity has control over the information in the ledger. It also makes it virtually impossible for hackers to manipulate data within the ledger.

## The Trust Machine

Blockchain technology is sometimes referred to as a “trust machine” because it facilitates secure peer-to-peer interactions between parties that do not necessarily trust each other. This is made possible by the use of cryptographic keys that allow users to authenticate themselves. The keys authenticate users by confirming their identity based on unique identifiers such as their email address or phone number. Once a user has been authenticated, he or she can interact with the blockchain network to securely store data.
The blockchain network operates autonomously without an intermediary by using smart contracts to automatically execute the terms and conditions established by the parties involved in the transaction. The decentralized design of the blockchain network means that there is no single entity to whom users must outsource trust. As such, users can authenticate themselves and securely store data that is accessible only to those they wish to share it with.

## Why is Blockchain Technology so Important?

In addition to its ability to facilitate safe peer-to-peer interactions, blockchain technology can also be used to trigger automatic actions based on the terms and conditions specified by the parties involved in the transaction.
For example, a smart contract could be used by an insurance company to trigger an automatic payment to a policyholder whose car has been involved in an accident. This type of automation could save time and resources, as well as reduce opportunities for fraud. 
Similarly, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that manage confidential data. These contracts can specify the terms and conditions by which data owners can transmit their data to third parties. Smart contracts can also specify the terms and conditions by which data owners can request that third parties return their data.
By using blockchain technology to establish smart contracts that manage access to confidential data, businesses can provide assurances to their data owners that their information will be secure.

## Limiting Access to Confidential Data with Smart Contracts

When managing confidential data, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that limit access to only those parties that have authenticated themselves. The contracts can also specify the terms and conditions under which those third parties can access the data. 
By limiting access to only authenticated users, businesses can protect confidential data from malicious actors who may try to impersonate legitimate users. Furthermore, businesses can use blockchain technology to create smart contracts that unlock access to data once the parties involved have fulfilled the specified terms and conditions. For example, a healthcare company might use blockchain technology to create a smart contract that ensures that a computer at a specific location will only release a user’s medical data to a healthcare provider after the user has signed a consent form and paid their medical bill.

## Auditing and Tracking Confidential Data with Blockchains

Blockchain technology can also be used to audit and track the provenance of confidential data. This can be accomplished by logging every time that data is accessed, modified or transferred. This information is logged on the blockchain ledger and can be verified by anyone who has access to the ledger.
By logging the provenance of data, businesses can provide assurances to their clients that they are being transparent about how they are using the data. This could be especially important where sensitive data is concerned, such as in the healthcare sector, where consumers may be wary of giving out their data.
By auditing and tracking data, businesses can also be held accountable for their actions. If, for example, a healthcare company were to misuse a patient’s data, the blockchain ledger would make it clear when and how the data was accessed, as well as who accessed it.

## Shoring up Security with Strong Encryption Practices

Finally, blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the security of data by using strong encryption practices. The distributed ledger used in blockchain technology is distributed across thousands of computers that are geographically dispersed. This arrangement ensures that no single computer or entity has control over the information in the ledger. It also makes it virtually impossible for hackers to manipulate data within the ledger.
Moreover, the decentralized nature of the blockchain network means that it is difficult for malicious actors to gain control of the entire network. As such, they would be unable to manipulate the data in the ledger even if they did manage to gain control of a portion of the network.

## Conclusion

Although blockchain technology is still in its early stages, it is already proving to be a reliable and secure technology that can be used to manage confidential data. By leveraging the various strengths of blockchain technology, businesses can strengthen the security of their data and improve their customers’ trust in their services.
By using blockchain technology, businesses can improve how they manage confidential data by securing it with strong encryption practices and limiting access to only authenticated users. These efforts can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks, as well as provide customers with greater transparency about how their data is being used.
