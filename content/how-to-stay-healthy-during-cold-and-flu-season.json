Flu and cold viruses are super sneaky and will use your body's defenses against you. If your body doesn't have enough water, your immune system won't function optimally and you'll be more susceptible to infections. One of the best ways to make sure you're staying hydrated is to drink water out of a straw. While you should be drinking 3-4 litres of water a day, it's easy to forget to do so when you're super busy with work and life in general. Drinking water out of a straw ensures that you're staying hydrated throughout the day and helping minimize the risk of getting sick.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to make sure you're staying hydrated is to change your water filter. If you're living in an area with poor water quality, contaminants like chlorine can build up in your water filter, making it less effective at filtering out bacteria and keeping your water clean. When your water filter isn't working at its best, you might not be getting the amount of water you need to stay hydrated and healthy.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Get enough sleep\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Another crucial part of staying healthy is getting enough sleep.

When you're out and about, use hand sanitizer if there aren't any paper towels near you.\nWhen you're home, you should wash your hands more often than just after you go to the bathroom. You should wash your hands after you cough or sneeze, after you change your child's diaper (or clean up after your pet), after you prepare food and before you touch any food that isn't pre-packaged.`),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Avoid touching your face as much as possible, as this is how cold and flu viruses are usually passed from person to person.

When you touch your face, you transfer all kinds of yucky germs from your hands, the door handle at work, or the subway pole onto your face.\nWhen you touch your face, you transfer those germs onto your mucus membranes, which are the areas inside your nose, mouth, and eyelids.
