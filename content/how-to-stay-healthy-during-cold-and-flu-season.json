Flu and cold viruses are super sneaky and will use your body's defenses against you. If your body doesn't have enough water, your immune system won't function optimally and you'll be more susceptible to infections. One of the best ways to make sure you're staying hydrated is to drink water out of a straw. While you should be drinking 3-4 litres of water a day, it's easy to forget to do so when you're super busy with work and life in general. Drinking water out of a straw ensures that you're staying hydrated throughout the day and helping minimize the risk of getting sick.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to make sure you're staying hydrated is to change your water filter.

When you're out and about, use hand sanitizer if there aren't any paper towels near you.\nWhen you're home, you should wash your hands more often than just after you go to the bathroom.
