## How to make a grilled cheese sandwich?

If you want the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, you need to follow the rules. It is not about the quality of the ingredients, but about how you prepare them. Let’s take a look! The first step to making the perfect grilled cheese is having the perfect bread. While it’s possible to use a variety of different kinds of bread for your sandwich, for the perfect grilled cheese, you want to use a thick-sliced white bread. Why white bread? It has a higher fat content than whole wheat or sourdough, which allows it to get crispy and golden on the outside without getting too dry or hard on the inside. Next, you’ll want to select a good cheese. Ideally, you’ll use a combination of cheddar and American, but really any cheese will do. You’ll only need about one cup of shredded cheese, so it won’t go to waste if you have leftovers. Once you have your cheese and bread, you need to start buttering your bread. You’ll need about a tablespoon of butter for every two slices of bread. Make sure your butter is room temperature so it won’t melt and run off the sides of your sandwich as you cook it. After you’ve buttered your bread, add the cheese. You’ll want to be generous here, as the cheese is what will make the inside of your sandwich gooey and delicious. Once you’ve added your cheese, it’s time to assemble the rest of your sandwich. Put the two pieces of buttered bread together, and then place the assembled sandwich on a hot griddle, stovetop, or frying pan.

## Cheese matters

This is one of the most important aspects of the perfect grilled cheese sandwich. You can use any cheese you want, but make sure it is melty and gooey. You can use cheddar, mozzarella, gouda, and many others. If you want to add some flavor, try a spicy cheese such as jalapeno or habanero. Whatever cheese you decide to use, you will have the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.

Make sure you are using quality cheese and not the pre-shredded stuff. Pre-shredded cheese has a ton of preservatives and a bunch of extra ingredients. You will want a block of cheese for better quality.

You can also add a twist to your grilled cheese by adding some additional toppings. You can add tomato, bacon, or even jalapeno peppers to make it more exciting.

## Know your bread

The only thing between you and the perfect grilled cheese sandwich is the bread. When it comes to making the best grilled cheese, there are two main types of bread: thick and thin-sliced. Thick-sliced bread is the go-to for most people, but there’s also another option you may not have thought of: tortillas! Tortillas make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich wrap.

Thick-sliced white bread - Thick-sliced white bread is the go-to for most people, but there’s also another option you may not have thought of: tortillas! Tortillas make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich wrap.

Sourdough - Sourdough is a popular choice among grilled cheese sandwich-lovers because it gets a little crispy on the outside while remaining soft and chewy inside.

Whole wheat - Whole wheat bread is what you should be using if you’re trying to make the healthiest grilled cheese sandwich. It’s a good idea to toast it lightly before assembling the sandwich to get a nice crispy texture.

## Don’t forget the butter!

You might be wondering why you need to butter both sides of the bread in the first place, but trust us, it’s worth it. Butter is a key ingredient to getting the perfect golden brown colour and the right amount of crispiness on the outside. If you forget to butter one side of the bread, you’ll end up with a sandwich that’s a little soggy on one side. Butter both sides of the bread before assembling the sandwich and you won’t have to worry about this issue.

When you’re making a grilled cheese sandwich, it’s best to use real butter instead of margarine. Real butter has a higher fat content, which is important for getting that crisp, golden colour on the outside of the sandwich.

## Maintain the heat!

If you want to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, you need to maintain the heat of the pan or griddle. If your pan isn’t hot enough, the bread will take a long time to crisp up and may also become soggy. If the pan is too hot, the outside of the sandwich may burn before the inside is even warm.

To make sure that you’re maintaining the right amount of heat, you can test the pan with a few drops of water. If they sizzle but don’t evaporate immediately, the pan is just right. If they evaporate immediately, the pan is too hot and you’ll need to reduce the heat.

## Add some crunch!

If you want to go above and beyond, try adding a little crunch to your grilled cheese sandwich. Crispy bacon, croutons, or cornflakes are just a few options for making your grilled cheese extra special. You can even add both bacon and croutons for an extra crispy sandwich!

Add whatever crunchy toppings you’d like to your grilled cheese sandwich, but make sure to add them before the cheese. If you add the crunchy toppings after the cheese has melted, it won’t stick to the sandwich and will fall out the second you try to lift the sandwich.

## Conclusion

The best part about grilled cheese is that everyone can make it the way they like it. You can even mix and match toppings to come up with your own special combination. The next time you’re craving a warm, gooey sandwich, try making a classic grilled cheese or get creative with your toppings. No matter what you choose, you’re sure to enjoy the perfect grilled cheese sandwich!
