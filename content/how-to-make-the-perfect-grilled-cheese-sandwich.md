A grilled cheese sandwich is the perfect comfort food. It's simple to make and can be customized to your liking. Here's how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.

Start with good bread. A sturdy, yet soft, bread is key for the perfect grilled cheese. Slice the bread into thick pieces so it can hold up to the cheese and other fillings without falling apart.

Choose your cheese. A sharp cheddar is a classic choice, but feel free to experiment with other types of cheese. Gruyere and Swiss are also excellent options.

Slice the cheese into thin pieces so it will melt evenly. If using a block of cheese, shred it first.

Butter the bread. Spread a thin layer of butter on each slice of bread. This will help the bread brown evenly and prevent it from sticking to the pan.

Assemble the sandwich. Place the cheese on one slice of bread and top with the other slice. If using multiple types of cheese, layer them evenly between the slices of bread.

Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a bit of butter. Place the sandwich in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.

Serve immediately and enjoy!
