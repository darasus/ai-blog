## Create a habit

When people finally decide to get serious about their health, they often dive in head first, trying to change their diet, their exercise routine, and other aspects of their life all at once. In many cases, this causes people to get overwhelmed and give up quickly. Instead of trying to change everything at once, focus on forming one new healthy habit that will assist you in your journey towards better health. For example, if you want to improve your diet, choose one new vegetable to incorporate into your diet each week. If you want to improve your exercise routine, choose one exercise to add to your routine each week. Small changes can add up over time, and will help you stay motivated to continue improving your overall health.

## Make your meals count

It’t easy to get caught up in the busyness of life and forget to eat enough nutritious food. When you’re eating healthy, it’t important to eat three nutritious meals a day and two snacks in between meals. However, it’s easy to get distracted and forget to eat. Instead of eating when you’re hungry, try to eat at regular intervals every day. If you’re having trouble keeping up with your meals and snacks, try out a tracking tool. There are many apps available that can help you track your meals and snacks throughout the day. You can also write down what you’re eating each day in a journal.

## Start small

If you’ve tried to eat healthier in the past and failed, don’t be hard on yourself. Many people try to change too much, too quickly, and then end up quitting before they even get started. If you’re someone who is trying to make positive eating changes, start small. Pick one or two small changes that you want to make, such as cutting out soda or drinking more water. When you pick one or two small changes, you’re less likely to get overwhelmed and quit before you even get started. Once you’ve made a couple small changes, you can start to add more.

## Don’t compare yourself to others

In this social media-driven world we live in, it’s easy to compare yourself to others. You may look around and see that others are eating junk food while you’re trying to eat healthy. It’t important that you don’t compare yourself to others, and instead focus on your own health and eating habits. For example, you may see that someone else is eating a chocolate bar for lunch and feel bad about yourself for eating a salad. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own eating habits and positive changes you’re making in your life.

## Reward yourself

Staying motivated to eat healthy can be difficult at times. At the end of a long day, you may feel like eating a giant bowl of ice cream for dinner. When you feel like giving up on your goals and habits, try to reward yourself for your progress. This can be helpful when you’re struggling to stay motivated to eat healthy. For example, you may choose to reward yourself with a new pair of running shoes after every 10 miles you run. You can also choose to reward yourself with small things like taking a break from your usual routine, getting a massage, or reading a book.

## Get a fitness buddy

Habits are powerful things, and they can help you stay motivated to eat healthy if you’re consistent with them. If you’ve tried to change your eating habits in the past, you may have found that it’s difficult to stay consistent. This can make it easier to stay motivated to eat healthy if you have a fitness buddy who is trying to make positive changes in their life. Having someone else who is trying to make positive changes can help keep you accountable. You may also find that you’re more likely to make positive changes in your life if you have someone else counting on you to follow through.

## Let go of guilt and shame

It’s important to remember that eating healthy doesn’t have to be boring or tasteless. It’s also important to let go of guilt and shame around eating. Eating healthy doesn’t mean that you’ll always feel guilty or ashamed. In fact, eating healthy can be a joyful and delicious experience. You don’t have to feel guilty or ashamed for eating something that isn’t healthy. Instead, try to focus on eating healthy 80% of the time and let go of guilt and shame around eating. If you make healthy eating changes in your life, you may also notice that you have more energy, feel less stressed, and have more time in your day.

## Conclusion

Staying motivated to eat healthy can be difficult. When you’re trying to eat healthy, you’re choosing to make positive choices for your health. It’s important to remember that this process may take time as your body adjusts to healthier eating habits. It’s also important to remember that no journey is ever linear. You may have ups and downs along the way, and that’s completely normal. It’s important to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes while you’re trying to stay motivated to eat healthy.
