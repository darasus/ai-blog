  "summary": "Foster the People's new album is reminiscent of classic rock bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. Artists often write about the things they experienced in their youth, so it makes sense that your artistic career is shaped by your formative years. When you're writing songs, you’re likely to explore what you were experiencing during that time. It’s healthy for artists to push their own boundaries, and artists who want to experiment with new sounds should consider releasing their music independently – this will allow you to fully explore your creative vision.",
  "intro": "New music comes with a lot of baggage. These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots. \nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what’t clear is that there’s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they’ve done before. In fact, it can be incredibly exciting when musicians dig into who they were as teenagers, young adults and beyond.\nIf you need convincing, just take a listen to Foster the People’s latest album – ‘Sacred Hearts Club’ – which is Led Zeppelin meets Weezer with hints of Pink Floyd and other psychedelic influences. Here are five reasons why this LP is proof positive that going back home is the perfect way for any artist to get inspired again.",
  "content": "## Nostalgia can be a beautiful thing.\n\nWhen nostalgia becomes a creative fuel, it’s a beautiful thing. This is especially true for artists who revisit the music of their youth. Many artists – including Foster the People – first got their start in garage bands in their teens.\nIf you’re an artist seeking inspiration, it can be helpful to think back to your high school years. Foster the People’s album is reminiscent of classic rock bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. In fact, “Hustling” features a saxophone solo that sounds eerily similar to Pink Floyd’s “Money”. It might seem like a stretch, but artists like Pink Floyd and the Beatles have always served as inspiration for musicians. You might not be the next Zeppelin or Floyd, but you can certainly be inspired by them.\n\n\n## It helps you reconnect with your youth.\n\nWhen artists go back to their roots, they’re often reconnecting with the musical vision they had as a teenager. Artists often write about the things they experienced in their youth, so it makes sense that your artistic career is shaped by your formative years. When you’re writing songs, you’re likely to explore what you were experiencing during that time.\n\nIf you’re an artist who wants to get back to your roots, start by exploring what was going on in your life during that time. Foster the People’s album certainly reflects the band’s youth. The LP’s theme is tied to the California license plate “SLOMO” – a reference to the band’s time spent in Los Angeles. It’s possible that the band members were inspired by their experiences living in the city, which brings us back to the previous point.\n\n\n## Sometimes going back to the basics is exactly what you need.\n\nIf you find yourself in a creative rut, consider taking a step back and simplifying your process. For example, make a list of your favorite artists in the world, and ask yourself why you’re a fan. This can help you engage with your core audience.\n\nFoster the People's list of influences for this album include Pink Floyd and Weezer. At their core, these artists are great songwriters. The best way to get back to the basics is to focus on your craft and come up with a bunch of killer songs.\n\nIf you want to get back to the basics but aren’t sure where to start, try writing lyrics without the music. This will help you identify what you’re really feeling. You can then take these emotions and use them to create music.\n\n\n## It’s healthy for artists to push their own boundaries.\n\nWhen artists go back to their roots, they’re often looking to push their boundaries. We’re all familiar with the saying, “If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” But in this case, it might be exactly what you need.\nWhen Foster the People released their debut album in 2011, the music was very accessible. The album was heavy on pop, alternative and dance sounds. The band’s new album, ‘Sacred Hearts Club’, is much more experimental. Tracks like “Pay the Man” are multi-layered and heavy on psychedelic sounds.\n\nWhen artists push their own boundaries, there’s a good chance listeners will respond. Artists who want to experiment with new sounds should consider releasing their music independently – this will allow you to fully explore your creative vision.\n\n\n## You’ll have a whole new set of tools to work with.\n\nWhen artists go back to their roots, they often discover they now have a whole new set of tools to work with. The best way to put this into practice is to start listening to music that inspired your favourite artists, but also look at the artists who were inspired by those artists.\nThis is a cyclical process that can help you get inspired and create something new. Foster the People has done just that. Take the track “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy” and the track “Fireflies” by Owl City. These songs are very similar to “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy”, and both songs were written and released before “Loyal Like Sid and Nancy”.\n\nYou might not be able to create an album as thematically and sonically consistent as ‘Sacred Hearts Club’, but you can certainly pull a few tricks from Foster the People’s playbook.\n\n\n## You’ll discover your core listeners respond to most.\n\nWhen artists go back to their roots, they’re often looking for inspiration. But along the way, they might discover that their core listeners respond to something specific in their music. This could be anything from a particular melody to an element of your lyrics.\nWhen Foster the People created their debut album, they knew they wanted certain songs to be singles. The band even used click tracks to make sure they hit the beats they wanted. But on their new album, they displayed a certain level of spontaneity.\n\nFor example, the track “Pay the Man” begins with an improvised saxophone solo. It’s possible that the band members were inspired by their youth and wanted to experiment. If this is the case, it’s possible that your core listeners respond to your experimentation. And that’s a good thing! It means you’re staying true to yourself.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFoster the People's latest album is a fun ride through the group's youth. When artists go back to their roots, they're often looking to push their boundaries. Artists who want to experiment with new sounds should consider releasing their music independently to give them full creative freedom. When artists get back to their roots, they discover they now have a whole new set of tools to work with. When artists go back to their roots, they're often looking to push their boundaries. It's healthy for artists to experiment with new sounds and push their creative boundaries when going back to their roots. When artists get back to their roots, they discover they now have a whole new set of tools to work with. You'll discover your core listeners respond to most when going back to your roots."
