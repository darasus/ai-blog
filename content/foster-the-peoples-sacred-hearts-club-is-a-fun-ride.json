These days, when an artist releases a new album, fans expect it to be one thing: A reaction to their previous work. And with that in mind, we have witnessed a surge of artists going back to their roots. Artists like The Weeknd and Future released old-school R&B albums; Paramore went back to the punk rock sounds of their youth; even Panic! At The Disco dropped the theatrical overtones of their last record and returned to their emo roots.\nWhether or not this is an intentional trend remains up for debate. But what\\u2019t clear is that there\\u2019s nothing wrong with artists taking a left turn after releasing something different than what they\\u2019ve done before.

The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s about an astronaut called Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars after his crewmates think he\\u2019s dead and leave without him. This might seem as just another case of annoying Hollywood over-simplification: after all, we get so many bioengineered super-geniuses with computer uplink implants that they can become trapped in remote locations via their own stupidity. But there\\u2019s more to it than that.\nIn both book and film, the humanity of Watney comes out in everything he does to survive: logical thinking (how can I eat this potato again?), ingenuity (I need water; how do I distill it from our CO2 filters), courage (explore the abandoned outpost), and compassion (contact my family). He also has a lot of fun with his predicament, cracking jokes through his video log and even going disco.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Maybe it\\u2019s the pressure to impress both new listeners and old fans, or simply the natural progression of any band that leaves them feeling eager to experiment. Whatever the reason, some of our favourite bands have produced some of their very best work with third albums.\nAnd so it is with All Time Low\\u2019s latest offering, \\u2018Last Young Renegade\\u2019. Following on from 2014 album \\u2018Future Hearts\\u2019, it is a record that sees the band in a brand-new light. Gone are the days of bouncy pop-punk anthems like \\u2018Crazy Endings\\u2019 or \\u2018Back Home Again\\u2019; instead we have a far more mature and atmospheric take on classic ATL songs like \\u2018Riot^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^^END^ 3>\\u2019 or \\u2018 Dark Side Of Your Own Atmosphere\\u2019.\nIn this article you will discover everything you need to know about All Time Low's 'Last Young Renegade'.
