From its humble beginnings in New York City, hip hop has grown into a worldwide sensation, with local scenes spawning in cities across the globe. This article explores the history of hip-hop music, from its roots as an underground movement in the early 1980s to its predominance as one of the most popular genres today.\nFans of rap music are undoubtedly aware that this style of music has origins in New York City during the 1970s and 1980s, but there is much more to know about how exactly it came about and how it evolved over time. From breakdancing to rapping, we\\u2019ll explore all of the elements that blended together to form what we now call \\u201Chip-hop\\u201D today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
