summary: NEM, or New Economy Movement, uses advanced system of smart contracts
  to manage almost any kind of commercial property. With smart assets, you can
  program just about any type of transaction and condition. NEM’s Smart Asset
  Token (NEMA) functions as a placeholder for any other asset that can be traded
  via a blockchain. NEMA allows developers to add their own smart assets to the
  NEM blockchain. Like other cryptocurrencies, NEM's developers designed their
  platform with a built-in mechanism that rewards people for contributing
  computing power.
intro: New Economy Movement or NEM is a new blockchain technology that aims to
  revolutionize the way digital assets are managed and recorded. NEM’s goal is
  to build a new economy with new digital asset management principles. Different
  from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Neo – which use their
  blockchains primarily as a payment ledger - the NEM blockchain uses an
  advanced system of smart contracts CoIN tokens, and atomic swaps to manage
  almost any kind of commercial property. The scope of its potential
  applications extends far beyond financial transactions. The non-blockchain
  application of NEM goes much further than just providing another medium for
  buying and selling things online. Its developers have also created a “smart
  asset” system that can be used on almost any business, organization, house,
  car, boat – anything you can think of! Let’s take a look at what exactly makes
  this crypto so special...

## NEM: What is it?

NEM, or New Economy Movement, is a blockchain technology that was first developed in 2015. It’s main purpose is to build a new economy with new digital asset management principles. In contrast to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Neo – which use their blockchains primarily as a payment ledger - the NEM blockchain uses an advanced system of smart contracts to manage almost any kind of commercial property. The scope of its potential applications extends far beyond financial transactions. The non-blockchain application of NEM goes much further than just providing another medium for buying and selling things online. Its developers have also created a “smart asset” system that can be used on almost any business, organization, house, car, boat – anything you can think of!

## What Are Smart Assets?

A smart asset is an asset represented on a blockchain that has built-in functionality and can be programmed to take certain actions based on predetermined conditions. This can be applied to a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrency tokens, land titles, securities, supply chain inventory, and more. With smart assets, you can program them to transfer ownership to another person, release a certain amount of tokens to someone, or execute other actions when certain conditions are met. If a person buys a share of stock, for example, the smart asset can be programmed to release some amount of the same cryptocurrency to that person. With smart assets, you can program just about any type of transaction and condition. Once programmed, these assets can easily be traded and exchanged for other assets.

## NEM’s Smart Asset Token (NEMA)

NEMA is an ERC-20 Token that functions as a placeholder for any other asset that can be traded via a blockchain. NEMA allows developers to add their own smart assets to the NEM blockchain. The token is distinct from other cryptocurrencies in that it doesn’t have its own blockchain, but it is nonetheless a very important part of the NEM ecosystem. NEMA is a critical part of the NEM blockchain. It allows developers to add their own custom tokens and use the same APIs and functions that the NEM blockchain uses. This means that developers can create their own tokens, host them on the NEM blockchain, and use the same APIs and smart contracts that are used by the native NEM token.

## How Does NEM make money?

Like most cryptocurrencies, NEM’s developers designed their platform with a built-in mechanism that rewards people for contributing computing power to the network. If a computer is connected to the network and used to process and verify transactions, then it will receive new tokens in the system. This is referred to as “mining” in the world of cryptocurrencies. Like other cryptocurrencies, NEM’s token (XEM) is used to reward people who contribute the necessary computing power to the network. If you contribute computing power to the NEM network, then you will receive XEM as a reward. 

## Why You Should Be Excited About NEM

NEM is one of the most advanced blockchain technologies available today. It has been in development and beta testing since 2015, and it has been used to power many different ecosystems. NEM has its roots in Japan, and it has been used to power an electronic health record system, an electronic voting system, and many other applications. NEM is a highly customizable blockchain, and it can be implemented in a wide variety of industries and use cases.

NEM’s blockchain is built to scale, and it is designed to be secured through delegated harvesting that uses a “trustless” distributed network. NEM’s token is a standard token, which means that it can be used on a wide variety of exchanges and with other blockchain technologies. It’s also built on top of a blockchain that has been in production for over three years, which means that it’s battle-tested and ready for widespread adoption.

## Where to buy and store NEM?

You can buy NEM tokens through many different exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, and Bittrex. NEM’s native token, XEM, is available for purchase on all of these exchanges. NEM can also be stored in a variety of wallets, including the official NEM Nano wallet, the NEM iOS wallet, the NEM Android wallet, and the NEM desktop wallet.

## Final Words

NEM has been around in one form or another since 2015, and it has been used as a part of many different blockchain applications. It’s a fully customizable blockchain that can be used in a wide variety of industries. NEM’s blockchain is built to scale, and it is a very secure network due to its delegated harvesting mechanism. Its token is also a standard token, which means that it can be used on a wide variety of exchanges and with other blockchain technologies.

Its development team has proven that they can build a secure, scalable blockchain, and they’ve been doing so for several years. If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency that has proven its worth and is ready for mainstream adoption, then you should definitely consider buying some NEM.
