If you're looking to cook healthier meals at home, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're on the right track. First, focus on incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your meals. This can be as simple as adding a salad to your dinner or swapping out your usual side dish for something healthier.

Another way to make your meals healthier is to cook with leaner meats and fish. When you're choosing your protein, look for options that are lower in saturated fat and cholesterol. You can also cut down on the amount of fat you use when cooking by using healthy cooking methods, such as grilling, baking, or steaming.

In addition to making healthier choices when it comes to the ingredients you use, it's also important to pay attention to portion sizes. When you're cooking for yourself, it's easy to make too much food and then overeat. To avoid this, measure out the servings before you start cooking and then stick to those portions.

Finally, don't forget that healthy eating is about more than just the food you put on your plate. Be sure to include physical activity in your daily routine as well. This can help you maintain a healthy weight, which is important for overall health.
