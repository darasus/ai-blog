## Plan your meals

Yes, this is the very first step to cooking healthy meals at home. No matter how fresh your ingredients are if you don’t have a plan, then you won’t end up with healthy meals.
Try to figure out what meals you’re going to make for the week, and use this to guide your menu planning. This will help you create well-balanced meals that serve up plenty of vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
Planning your meals also makes it easier to avoid unhealthy impulsive purchases and resist the urge to order takeout. By having healthy meals planned out for the week, you’ll have less reason to resort to eating out.
Another benefit of planning your meals is that you can use this as an opportunity to save money. By buying ingredients in bulk, you can save some cash on the food shopping bill. Plus, you can freeze any leftovers you have, so you’ll have healthy food ready to go on busy days!

## Shop and prep your ingredients

This is a great tip to help you cook healthier meals at home. By choosing fresh ingredients, rather than processed and packaged foods, you’ll be adding more vitamins and minerals to your diet.
You need to keep your fridge stocked with fresh produce, so you’ll have healthy ingredients ready to go when you need them. If you don’t have any fresh produce in your home, it’s a lot harder to cook healthy meals!
Try to make sure you have a variety of produce in your fridge at all times, including leafy greens, bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, and more. You can also prep your ingredients in advance, so you’ll have less to do when it comes time to cook.
Prepping your ingredients ahead of time is a great way to save time and money. You can use fresh produce to make salads, soups, and healthy snacks, which are all great ways to add more nutrition to your diet.

## Stick to lean meats

Meat is a great source of protein, but not all cuts are created equal. Focus on choosing lean meats, such as poultry, eggs, and fish. You can also add beans to your diet for extra protein.
Vegetarians and vegans will want to focus on beans, legumes, nuts, tofu, and other protein-rich plant-based foods.
Vegetarians can also include eggs and dairy in their diets, as long as they’re being mindful of servings sizes. Vegans, on the other hand, will have to rely on other protein-rich foods to get enough nutrients.
Vegetarians and vegans can also use fortified foods, iron-enriched cereals, iron-fortified tofu, iron-enriched grains, and other iron-rich foods to get protein. And remember to get your daily dose of vitamin B12 by eating fortified foods, such as cereals, or taking a multivitamin.

## Add healthy fats

Many people are under the false impression that all fats are bad for you. This isn’t true at all! Some fats are actually important for our health.
Fats help us stay full, feed our brains and muscles, and regulate hormones. They’re also essential for absorbing vitamins A, D, E, and K.
But not all fats are created equal! Focus on adding healthy fats to your diet. Good sources of healthy fats include avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
Vegetarians and vegans should be especially mindful of their fat intake. While animal products are one of the best sources of fat, there are lots of plant-based foods that are rich in healthy fats, too!
Making sure your diet includes healthy fats is a great way to boost your health. Healthy fats can help lower your cholesterol and protect against heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes.

## Incorporate leafy greens

Vegetables are the foundation of any healthy meal, so you should try to incorporate them into every meal you make.
Veggies don’t have to be boring: You can add them to salads, soups, sandwiches, casseroles, and more!
Veggies are full of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, and they’re an excellent way to get more nutrients into your diet.
Veggies should make up the bulk of your meals. A serving of veggies should be about the size of your fist.
The best veggies to incorporate into your diet are leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, and more. If you have trouble getting kids (or yourself!) to eat veggies, try offering them in different ways or incorporating them into recipes, like smoothies or soups. You can also try vegetables in different forms, like roasted veggies, steamed veggies, or vegetable-rich soups.

## Don’t forget the veggies and grains

Veggies and grains are important to any balanced diet, so make sure to include plenty of both in your meals.
Grain-based foods, like whole-wheat pasta and whole-grain breads and cereals, should be a part of any healthy diet.
Veggies are also essential to a healthy diet, so you should add them to your meals whenever possible.

## Key takeaway

A healthy diet is one of the best ways to stay healthy and live a long, happy life. To do that, you need to make sure you're eating the right foods, in the right amounts. Eating healthy can seem like a daunting task, but with the right diet, it doesn't have to be! With these tips, you can make sure your diet is healthier, and that you're getting the most out of your meals.
