However, it goes deeper than just putting electric guitars aside; these songs are stripped right down to the bare bones. There\\u2019s still plenty of production value\\u2014especially on the third track\\u2014but it feels like Puth made a conscious decision not to hide behind anything.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Indeed, it\\u2019s safe to say that hip-hop has infiltrated almost every aspect of modern life... so why does this subculture continue to flourish?\nHip hop is a brilliant hybrid of different genres, with influences stemming from blues, gospel, jazz, reggae and rock. Its explosive popularity can be attributed to a number of factors: its wordplay ethos; its roots as an African-American art form; its non-commercial nature as an underground scene; and its potential as a unifying force for disenfranchised youth across the globe.\nLet's take a look at why Hip Hop rules the world\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
