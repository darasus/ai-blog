Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Hugh Glass, a real-life explorer who was mauled by a bear while exploring the wilds of Montana in 1823. When he doesn\\u2019t die from his injuries, Glass embarks on an epic journey to find the men who left him for dead and exact justice upon them with his own hands.\nThe movie almost plays like a spiritual successor to \\u201CInception\\u201D \\u2013 it\\u2019s filled with symbolism, meaning, and philosophy. The only difference being this movie feels much more grounded in reality than anything else Inception had to offer. It may be due to the fact that it takes place in such an unforgiving environment; but regardless it does what Inception did not: create a story that makes you care about its characters in such an intimate way that you feel their pain just as much as their joys.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Rather than any superficial discussion of how many different kinds of people there are or whether one kind is better than another, it is an examination of what it means to be an individual in society by exploring the challenges that arise when one appears to be something they are not.\nThe plot follows the life and loves of two women; poor southern waitress Nora (Lilac) and her daughter Sarah who is being raised by her business-minded father George (Thomas). Nora\\u2019s light-skinned daughter falls for local boy Harry (Swayze), who does not know she also has darker blood. Meanwhile, George falls for Vida (Stapleton), a rich blonde socialite who will only marry him if he passes as white.\nImitation of Life offers commentary on racial identity, classism and even pansexuality through these characters, providing insight into their experiences and highlighting inequality wherever it exists.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
