These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries.

Text editors are often simpler in design, but GUI editors tend to feature more customization tools for coding. Despite the differences between the types of code editors, the goal of each is the same: to help developers write and edit code more efficiently.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When choosing a code editor, you should keep a few things in mind. First, you will want to make sure that your code editor of choice has syntax highlighting functionality. You should also look for integrations with other coding tools. For example, it\\u2019s important to select a code editor that supports the type of language that you write in most frequently.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Task Runners\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Task runners are basically automated workflows for developers. They help you to run different tasks by combining multiple tools and commands during the development process. For example, the task runner Gulp is designed to automate image optimization and CSS processing. This type of tool is especially useful for teams working on large projects.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are two common types of task runners: build tools and continuous integration tools.
