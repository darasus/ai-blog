As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually.

This is the tool that developers will use most frequently, and it\\u2019s important to have a strong understanding of the different options available.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are two basic types of code editors: text-based and GUI-based. Text editors are often simpler in design, but GUI editors tend to feature more customization tools for coding. Despite the differences between the types of code editors, the goal of each is the same: to help developers write and edit code more efficiently.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When choosing a code editor, you should keep a few things in mind. First, you will want to make sure that your code editor of choice has syntax highlighting functionality. You should also look for integrations with other coding tools. For example, it\\u2019s important to select a code editor that supports the type of language that you write in most frequently.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Task Runners\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Task runners are basically automated workflows for developers. They help you to run different tasks by combining multiple tools and commands during the development process. For example, the task runner Gulp is designed to automate image optimization and CSS processing. This type of tool is especially useful for teams working on large projects.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are two common types of task runners: build tools and continuous integration tools. Build tools require developers to manually write code in order to set up processes. Continuous integration tools, on the other hand, are pre-programmed to run a specified set of tools automatically.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Version Control\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The next tool that every developer should know about is version control.

More importantly, version control helps to prevent the loss of data by providing a system for rolling back changes to previous code versions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are tons of different version control systems available. You will have to decide which one best fits your team\\u2019s needs. The most common version control systems are Git, Mercurial, and Subversion (SVN).

One of the fastest ways to lose efficiency is to write untested code. This means that you only write code that you know works, without having to run the finished product.
