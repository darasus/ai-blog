intro: >-
  The film version of The Big Short hits theaters this Friday, and it’s not
  subtle. Its tagline is “There’s a sucker born every minute. But they don’t
  grow up thinking they can be con men. They get taught to be one.” And its
  trailer goes on to say, “The housing bubble was about to burst… And a group of
  misfits saw it coming. Now these unlikely heroes must band together and bring
  down the greedy villains who crashed the world economy… Before anyone else
  gets hurt.”

  Unfortunately, that last part is not hyperbole. The actions of unscrupulous financial engineers — colloquially known as “bankers” — led directly to the Great Recession in 2008, which cost millions their jobs and homes, while triggering widespread deflation and anemic growth throughout much of the developed world for years thereafter.

## The Big Short is a searing indictment of the financial industry

The movie’s director, Adam McKay, has stated repeatedly in interviews that the intention of The Big Short is to indict the entire financial services industry. The film’s creators were extremely thorough in their research, and they went to great pains to ensure that they presented a factual, unbiased view of what really happened.
The filmmakers wanted to use this documentary-style film to inform the public at large about how the financial crash happened so that, hopefully, the same mistakes will not be made again.

## Everything you’re about to see is actually how things happened

The film The Big Short is a dramatization, not a documentary; what’s depicted in the movie didn’t happen exactly as it appears on screen. The story told in the movie, however, is accurate — it just happened in real life with real people, not actors.
One example is that the real protagonists shorted the market — they bet against the housing bubble and purchased credit default swaps (CDSs) with residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) as the underlying collateral.
However, since these activities are not easily understood by the average moviegoer, the film uses the more easily understood and dramatic alternative of “picking the winner and loser” by betting against the housing market as a whole and then profiting when the housing bubble burst.

## The 2008 collapse had nothing to do with savvy investors and everything to do with fraud

The Big Short is a financial thriller, so it follows that the protagonists are all “bad guys” who make their money by betting against the housing market. However, that’s not the way it really happened.
The financial engineers who engineered the 2008 collapse had inside information that gave them an unfair advantage in their trading. They knew that a lot of people would default on their mortgages because they were given mortgages they couldn’t afford by unscrupulous lenders like Countrywide Financial, who was actively subverting lending standards.
Even worse, many of the big banks were knowingly purchasing these subprime mortgages and securitizing them into residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), even though they knew the underlying collateral was of poor quality.

## Subprime mortgages were at the center of everything

The big banks created billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) based on subprime mortgages. A subprime mortgage is a mortgage given to a borrower with a low credit score and/or a high risk of default. These subprime mortgages have a much higher default rate than “prime” mortgages given to a borrower with a high credit score.
The key point about these subprime mortgages is that they were predominantly given to people who couldn’t afford to pay them back. This meant that a huge portion of these mortgages were going to default. These subprime mortgages were so shoddy that they weren’t worth very much on the open market.

## Wall Street leveraged these shoddy mortgages to create even shoddier products

Instead of just holding onto these subprime mortgages, the big banks decided to “leverage” them, which means they created even shoddier mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) out of these already shoddy subprime mortgages.
The big banks leveraged these subprime mortgages by buying credit default swaps (CDSs), which are basically insurance policies. These CDSs were backed by the shoddy, subprime mortgages that the big banks were holding onto.
The big banks leveraged these shoddy, subprime mortgages by buying CDSs on the shoddy, subprime mortgages while holding onto the shoddy, subprime mortgages. That’s a mouthful, but it means that the CDSs were essentially a bet that the shoddy, subprime mortgages would default.

## Regulators either didn’t understand what was going on or were simply in the pockets of the big banks

It’s not clear which scenario is true, but the people charged with monitoring and regulating the financial sector either didn’t understand what was happening or were in the pockets of the big banks.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, was aware of the shoddy practices going on in the financial sector but didn’t do anything about it, even though they had the authority to shut down many of the big banks, saving the global economy billions of dollars.
The Federal Reserve also had the authority to regulate the big banks and to stop them from leveraging up their shoddy, subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) with credit default swaps (CDSs).
Instead, the Fed did nothing while financial engineers created a house of cards worth trillions of dollars.

## So the big banks wrote their own rules and made billions

When the housing bubble burst, it was clear that all the big banks had tied their fortunes to the subprime mortgage market. That meant that, as the housing bubble began to deflate, the subprime mortgages held by the big banks were worth next to nothing.
The big banks were in trouble, but they were bailed out. The investment banks created by Wall Street after the great crash of 1929 were allowed to fail, but the investment banks created by Wall Street after the 2007 great crash were given trillions of dollars in taxpayer money to stay afloat.
The financial engineers responsible for bringing down the world economy were rewarded handsomely for their incompetence.

## Conclusion

The Big Short is a searing indictment of the financial industry that concluded with the financial engineers who brought down the world economy in 2008 being rewarded handsomely for their incompetence.
The film does a great job of documenting what really happened and providing an accessible depiction of a complicated subject. If you’re interested in learning more about the financial collapse of 2008, The Big Short is a great place to start.
