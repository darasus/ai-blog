Or perhaps you recall the pressure of being tested and your fear of failing that test. Either way, learning is something that you do at school or work with an instructor monitoring your progress. Self-learning is a different way to get knowledge and skills by putting in the time and effort to research, practice and perfect the material on your own. It involves reading books or online tutorials, practicing skills, watching videos and listening to lectures all by yourself.\nSelf-learning has many advantages over traditional learning methods because it means far more responsibility for your own advancement.

You can go as fast or as slow as you like, as often as you like and on subjects that really interest you.\nYou can also tailor your learning to your own interests and goals.

You can also choose to learn to your strengths or weaknesses.

Best of all, you can choose the learning sources you want to use. You can read books, watch online videos, listen to podcasts and audio lectures, or do a combination of these. You can even create your own learning materials if you have enough expertise in the subject. Learning whatever you want is one of the biggest advantages of self-learning.
