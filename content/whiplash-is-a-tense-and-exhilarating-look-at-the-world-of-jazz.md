Whiplash is a tense and exhilarating look at the world of jazz. The film follows the story of a talented young drummer, Andrew Neiman, who is pushed to the brink of excellence by his ruthless instructor, Terence Fletcher.

The film is a masterclass in tension, both musical and otherwise. The scenes in which Andrew practices for hours on end, or is berated by Fletcher, are some of the most intense in the film. But they're also some of the most exhilarating, as we watch Andrew's skills improve by leaps and bounds.

The music in the film is also top-notch, featuring some of the best jazz musicians in the business. The performances are electric, and will leave you on the edge of your seat.

Whiplash is a must-see for any fan of jazz, or of great filmmaking. It's a tense, exhilarating look at a world that few of us know anything about. But it's also a film that everyone can enjoy, regardless of their knowledge of jazz.
