summary: The sound mix on this film is something to behold. J.K. Simmons plays
  the ruthless Terence Fletcher, the "bad-ass motherfucker" who heads up the
  jazz program at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory of Music at New York
  University. Even when the film is not focusing on the drums, the
  cinematography is just gorgeous. It's a story that is as much about toxic,
  abusive relationships as it is about relationships that are worth fighting for
  and fighting for. The Verdict is unquestionably, the best film released in
  2014, if you're a fan of jazz or a student of the art of performance.
intro: >-
  Whiplash is a film about music, but it's not a musical. It's also a film
  about performance, but it's not a concert movie. It is, however, an
  electrifying and exhilarating portrait of the world of jazz drumming: its
  practice; its professors; its players; its perfectionists. It is both an
  ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale
  that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on
  pedestals.
   And yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us. Coming out of Sundance with the Audience Award and Best Director laurels, this indie has been getting rave reviews for all the right reasons — which we’ll get into in just a bit -- but it took me two viewings to figure out why that was the case.
  Read on to know why Whiplash is one of the best films on jazz and performance released this year:

## The Sound Mix is a Game-Changer

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the sound mix on this film is something to behold. You could probably re-edit the movie with your eyes closed — you know, because you’re not actually taking in the visuals at this point. All the drumming, the cymbal crashes, and the solos are so crisp, you can practically feel them reverberating through your ears and skull.
The sound of the drums, in particular, is just… wow. The crashes and the ride cymbals have a physicality that you can almost feel in your gut, but the snares have a sharpness that almost borders on painful. If you’re not listening to this film with the volume high enough, you’re missing out on one of its greatest assets.

## J.K. Simmons is Unstoppable

So, we’ve talked up the sound and visuals of this film, but let’s remember that it’s a movie about people -- real characters who are facing real challenges and who will be judged -- and sometimes condemned -- by real audiences based on what they are able to convey.
J.K. Simmons plays the ruthless Terence Fletcher, the “bad-ass motherfucker” who heads up the jazz program at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory of Music at New York University. (It's based on the real-life New York University Tisch School of the Arts' Music Department.)

Fletcher is a man who demands certain perfection from his students, but he’s also a man who can weather any storm -- verbal or otherwise -- with a smile on his face and a gleam in his eye. Simmons is unstoppable as this character, but he never tips over into cartoonish, mustache-twirling territory.

## Miles Teller Demands Your Attention

As the film’s would-be hero, one Andrew Neyman, Miles Teller is someone you have to keep your eye on. Neyman is a talented drummer who is trying to be great, but is also just a guy trying to get through college -- and a relationship -- while doing so. There’s a desperation and a tenacity to Neyman that keeps him from becoming a one-dimensional character who is just an empty vessel for the audience’s adoration.
He’s someone who has his eyes open (as best he can) to the realities of Fletcher’s world and is determined to meet the challenge head-on, no matter the cost.

## The Cinematography is Breathtaking

As we’ve mentioned, the visuals of this film are striking, but they’re not the only thing that makes this a visually arresting experience. The use of light and shadows in this film is just phenomenal.
The shadows cast by the drums and cymbals are almost as much a character as the actual instruments and their players.

And even when the film is not focusing on the drums, the cinematography is just gorgeous. The colors, the shadows, the use of light -- it’s all strikingly beautiful and yet still somehow gritty, as though it’s trying to remind us that it’s not all just a pretty picture.

## It’s About More than Just Music Lessons

Now, we’ve talked about all the things that make Whiplash such a great film, but we haven’t really talked about what it is about. Essentially, this film is about a man who will do anything for greatness.
It’s about a professor who is willing to sacrifice people -- relationships, sanity, and even lives -- for excellence. For Fletcher, the ends justify the means, and he doesn’t really care who gets hurt as long as his students are performing at the highest level.
It’s a story that is as much about toxic, abusive relationships as it is about relationships that are worth fighting for.

## The Verdict

Whiplash is, unquestionably, one of the best films on jazz and the art of performance released in 2014, if not the decade. It is an engaging, gripping, and exciting look into what drives people to create -- and how they can sometimes cross the line into obsession. It's also a testament to how a film can be great despite having a relatively straightforward plot with no major twists or turns.

If you’re a fan of jazz or a student of the art of performance, make sure you check out Whiplash. It’s an experience you don’t want to miss out on.
