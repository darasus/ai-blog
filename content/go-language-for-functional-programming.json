Many developers have taken a liking to Go because of its simplicity, readability, and faster compilation time. Other benefits include having little to no runtime overhead, being memory safe by default, and being able to compile Go code as standalone binaries or as packages (called packages in Go).\nGo is an ideal language for scientific computing due to its performance, ease of use, and standard libraries. This blog will outline reasons you should consider using Go for your next project that involves heavy scientific computing.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Well, you might be surprised to learn that it\\u2019s Python. Why? Because it\\u2019s the language of tomorrow.\nNow you might be thinking: Why does that make it the language of tomorrow? After all, shouldn\\u2019t we be focusing on learning languages like COBOL that will help us in our future career as an accountant or something like that? Well\\u2026 perhaps. But maybe not so much. See, while those other programming languages are great for some things, they aren\\u2019t so great for others. And when we take a look at what other programming languages won\\u2019t be able to do in the future because of their limitations (or maybe just their age), we see why programmers today are saying that Python is going to be the dominant language of tomorrow.
