It is a paradigm that allows you to think about your code in terms of input, output, and operations on those inputs and outputs. The advantages of using functional programming are higher code readability, ease of maintenance and testing, and shorter implementation time for complex algorithms.\nA variety of languages support functional programming features. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs as well as the other programming languages you already know. Depending on your preferences for syntax, size of community support, or availability of libraries for the type of projects you are working on now or might work on in future, different options might suit your needs better than others.\nIn this article we will explore some popular Go Language alternatives for Functional Programming with examples and pro/cons for each one:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

A lot of modern functional programming languages have been inspired by Haskell, including Scala and Clojure.\nThe biggest advantage to using Haskell for your next project is that you can scale that project to huge sizes without needing to change your programming language. Haskell is used for all kinds of large-scale projects, from web services to artificial intelligence research.\nThe main reason for this is that the language has a strong, static type system. This means that the compiler can basically check your code at the level of \"does this code even make sense?\" This makes it much easier to catch bugs early in the process and prevent them from making it into production.\nHaskell also has a reputation of being a difficult language to learn, but once you are fluent, it will give you the power to build nearly anything.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Scale\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Scale is an emerging functional programming language that aims to make it easy to write distributed, high-performance systems.
