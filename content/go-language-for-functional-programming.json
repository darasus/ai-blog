This means that the compiler can basically check your code at the level of \"does this code even make sense?\" This makes it much easier to catch bugs early in the process and prevent them from making it into production.\nHaskell also has a reputation of being a difficult language to learn, but once you are fluent, it will give you the power to build nearly anything.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Scale\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Scale is an emerging functional programming language that aims to make it easy to write distributed, high-performance systems.

Its simple syntax and powerful features have made it especially popular among programmers who specialize in building compilers and interpreters.\nGo is a general-purpose programming language with support for structured methods, visibility qualifiers, and embedded type definitions. It\\u2019s a statically typed language with support for interfaces,Ad hoc polymorphism, and type embedding.\nIn this blog post, we explore the considerations you need to make when choosing a programming language for GUI programming. Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of using Go for your next GUI project.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
