So, which one should you learn first? If you\\u2019re looking to get started in the world of coding, Javascript is a fantastic place to start. In fact, it can be a great beginner programming language for those who have little or no experience in this field. Why is that? Well, as the most common language used for website creation, learning Javascript helps you understand how websites operate on an individual level.\nLet this step-by-step guide to learning Javascript help you take your new skillset to the next level! From understanding what Javascript is and why it\\u2019s important to mastering the fundamentals of coding like variables and conditional statements, we\\u2019ll walk you through everything you need to know about getting started with this dynamic programming language.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
