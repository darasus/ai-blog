Whether in a home, restaurant, cafeteria or any other eatery, almost all food establishments serve high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat meals that are laden with salt and unhealthy oils.What is unfortunate about this situation is that many people have no choice but to eat this way on a regular basis.
