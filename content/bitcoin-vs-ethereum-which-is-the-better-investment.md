summary: Bitcoin is a type of “token” that is built on the “proof-of-work”
  network. Meanwhile, the "Eminium" network allows developers to build
  applications on the network. Both of these virtual currencies were created
  using blockchain technology. And they each have a finite supply that is
  expected to be released over time. Bitcoin's price has been around since 2009,
  and its price has risen steadily since 2011. Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, which
  means that the token can be exchanged for a wide range of assets.
intro: >-
  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies that have grown in
  popularity, availability, and usefulness over the last few years. Both of
  these digital assets have also proven to be profitable for investors. But
  which is the better investment: Bitcoin or Ethereum?

  With so many similarities between these two virtual currencies, it’s easy to see why some may wonder which one is more valuable. After all, both are built on blockchain technology; they are both available as a digital token; and they are both used as payment in some cases.

  However, when we take a deeper look at how these two different types of tokens operate and what sort of potential they have long-term, it becomes clearer which one is likely to be worth more money.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, and it’s also the most popular one in the world. It is a decentralized financial system, which means that it operates without a central authority or single administrator. Instead, all transactions on the network are verified by the network itself. Bitcoin’s goal is to become a globally accepted form of currency that is not controlled by any single government or group of people.
Unlike traditional currencies, however, Bitcoin isn’t issued by a government. Instead, it is “mined” by computers. People who contribute computing power to the network earn new bitcoins as a reward. This process is called mining, and it also serves to secure the network and make new bitcoins more scarce.

## Ethereum: A Short Introduction

Ethereum is a type of cryptocurrency, but it is more than just a digital asset. Ethereum’s creators built it as an open software platform that developers can use to create blockchain-based applications. In other words, Ethereum is a global computing system that can be used for a variety of different applications. Ethereum has been compared to the internet, and many people believe it could have even greater potential over the long term.
These blockchain-based applications are often called “decentralized applications” or “dApps.” And Ethereum’s network allows them to be programmed with “smart contracts.” These are computer protocols that allow the terms of a contract to be executed automatically if certain conditions are met.

## How Are Bitcoin and Ethereum Different?

Both of these virtual currencies were created using blockchain technology. And they each have a finite supply that is expected to be released over time. However, that is where the similarities end.

- Type of Token - Bitcoin is a type of “token” that is built on the “proof-of-work” network. Meanwhile, Ethereum is a type of “token” that is built on a “proof-of-stake” network.

- Focus - Bitcoin was created as a new form of money. Ethereum was created as a platform where people could build applications.

- Speed - Bitcoin transactions take about 10 minutes to be confirmed. Ethereum transactions take less than 10 seconds to be confirmed.

- Scalability - Bitcoin can only process a few transactions per second. Ethereum can process thousands of transactions per second.

- Programmability - Bitcoin can only be programmed with “if/then” statements. Ethereum’s “smart contracts” allow developers to write more complex code.

## Pros of Bitcoin as an Investment

- A proven track record - Bitcoin has been around since 2009, and its price has risen steadily since 2011. This shows that the token has been a good investment for a long time.

- It’s liquid - Bitcoin is very liquid. This means that the token can be exchanged for a wide range of assets, including fiat money.

- It’s a store of value - Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, which makes it a good store of value.

- It could rise in value - Bitcoin could rise in value due to the token being used as an accepted form of payment.

- It has low transfer fees - Bitcoin has low transfer fees. This could become more attractive as network fees for Ethereum become more expensive.

## Pros of Ethereum as an Investment

- It has high potential - Ethereum’s platform has a lot of potential. This means that it could bring significant value to the network in the future.

- It has a growing user base - Ethereum has a growing user base that is using the token to fuel its dApps.

- It’s scalable - Ethereum has a scalable network that can easily process dApp activity.

- It has strong developer support - Ethereum has strong developer support, which could lead to more dApps being created.

- It’s a store of value - Ethereum’s token, Ether, is a “store of value.”

- It has a low network fee - Ethereum has a low network fee that is expected to become even lower in the future.

## Final Words: Which is the Better Investment?

Overall, Ethereum has more potential than Bitcoin. This is because it is a platform where people can create new applications, and some of those applications could end up having significant value.
Furthermore, Ethereum’s network is scalable and has low transfer fees. This means that it could become a major platform for dApps and smart contracts in the future.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is mainly being used as a store of value. This means that its use cases are limited, and the demand for its tokens could drop if people start to lose interest in the asset.
In the end, it makes more sense to invest in Ethereum because it is more likely to bring significant value in the future.
