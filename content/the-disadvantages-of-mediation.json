Mediation is a voluntary process, and parties can walk away from mediation at any time. Going to mediation with an open mind and realistic expectations can help you make the most of the opportunity.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Mediation Process Is Lengthy\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The mediation process can be as short or as long as the mediator determines it will be. While there are no strict rules, you should be prepared for mediation to last a long time. If the parties involved have never been through mediation before, a mediator will typically spend time getting to know the people involved in the dispute and explaining the process. This initial meeting can last a few hours or even a full day. The second meeting will be devoted to exploring possible solutions to the problem and deciding if the parties are ready to agree on a solution or need more time. The third meeting will be devoted to signing the mediation agreement and resolving any outstanding issues, if necessary. Depending on the complexity of the dispute, the mediation process can take anywhere from several weeks to several months.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"It\\u2019s An Intensive Process\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation is a very intensive process that can be emotionally draining for everyone involved. It can be difficult to find the right mediator, agree on the terms of mediation and then reach an agreement. Throughout the process, the mediator will try to guide the parties towards a mutually acceptable solution. Once the mediator concludes that the parties are not making sufficient progress, he or she might end the discussions. If this happens, mediation ends.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The mediator\\u2019s job is to keep the discussions focused on the issue in dispute. The mediator will try to bring the parties together to agree on a solution that both sides can live with. Mediators do not make decisions for the parties; they help the parties make their own decisions. They are there to facilitate communication and assist the parties in exploring possible solutions. When it comes to working out the details of the proposed solution, the mediator steps back and lets the parties take over.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"You Have To Disclose Your Strategy And Hand Over Documents To The Opposing Party\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In mediation, you have to be open and transparent about the facts of your case and your strategy. You will have to disclose the details of your case, including the facts and figures, and hand over documents that support your claims. You might feel uncomfortable doing this, especially if there are weaknesses in your case that you prefer to keep to yourself. Remember, mediation is a process where both parties are trying to find a solution to their dispute. Both parties are entitled to know what the other side has to say and why they are entitled to what they are asking for.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The mediator will make sure both parties have an opportunity to speak and that everything that is said remains confidential.

This means that the details of your dispute can be disclosed to the public and will be published in court documents if the case progresses to litigation. If confidentiality is an important factor for you, you might have a difficult time accepting mediation as a dispute resolution method, especially if you are dealing with a sensitive issue. However, there are some exceptions to confidentiality, such as if your claim involves allegations of child abuse or domestic violence.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Even if the mediation process remains confidential, there are still a couple of instances where the information will become public knowledge.

This means that there are some restrictions on what can be discussed and agreed upon during mediation. You cannot agree to waive your constitutional rights or settle a claim for a sum that is greater than you are entitled to. You can, however, agree on a different way to resolve the dispute. For example, if you are claiming that the opposing party breached a contract, you can propose mediation as a method for resolving the dispute instead of having the court enforce the terms of the contract.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can also agree on a different amount that you are entitled to.

If you are considering mediation, you should be aware of these drawbacks so that you can prepare for them and make sure that mediation is the right choice for you.
