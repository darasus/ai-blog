It is a collaborative, focused process that provides an opportunity for both sides to communicate clearly and directly, without the pressure of potential negative consequences from other types of conflict resolution. The result is a faster, more cost-effective resolution than going to court or some other formal proceeding.\nMediation for businesses has many benefits. Chief among them are reduced stress, greater trust, increased collaboration, and improved performance. Negotiating can be stressful and lead to strained relationships if one party feels like the other isn\\u2019t being fair or trustworthy.\nMediation helps resolve these issues in a constructive way by establishing a safe space where people can fully understand each other\\u2019s perspectives. Trust increases when people feel like they won\\u2019t be attacked or criticized for their ideas. Collaboration improves as everyone works together towards a common goal instead of against each other.
