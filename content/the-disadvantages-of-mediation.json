While there are no strict rules, you should be prepared for mediation to last a long time. If the parties involved have never been through mediation before, a mediator will typically spend time getting to know the people involved in the dispute and explaining the process. This initial meeting can last a few hours or even a full day. The second meeting will be devoted to exploring possible solutions to the problem and deciding if the parties are ready to agree on a solution or need more time.

It can be difficult to find the right mediator, agree on the terms of mediation and then reach an agreement.

Once the mediator concludes that the parties are not making sufficient progress, he or she might end the discussions. If this happens, mediation ends.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The mediator\\u2019s job is to keep the discussions focused on the issue in dispute.

You will have to disclose the details of your case, including the facts and figures, and hand over documents that support your claims.

This means that the details of your dispute can be disclosed to the public and will be published in court documents if the case progresses to litigation.

However, there are some exceptions to confidentiality, such as if your claim involves allegations of child abuse or domestic violence.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Even if the mediation process remains confidential, there are still a couple of instances where the information will become public knowledge.

You cannot agree to waive your constitutional rights or settle a claim for a sum that is greater than you are entitled to. You can, however, agree on a different way to resolve the dispute. For example, if you are claiming that the opposing party breached a contract, you can propose mediation as a method for resolving the dispute instead of having the court enforce the terms of the contract.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can also agree on a different amount that you are entitled to.
