  When you’re on a budget, eating healthy can feel like an impossible task.

## Plan your meals

People who plan their meals are more likely to save money and eat healthier than those who don’t. It is crucial that you put some thought into what you’re going to be eating and when, as this will make your life easier in the long run. Having a meal plan can help you to reduce food waste and ensure that there is always something healthy and nutritious on the table.
Making a meal plan doesn’t need to be a lengthy process; in fact, it should take no more than a couple of hours. Simply decide on your family’s nutritional needs and any dietary restrictions (i.e., vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.).
Plan your weekly meals and write them down on a calendar. This will keep you on track and allow you to purchase the necessary ingredients at the most economical times.

## Shop only for what’s on your list

You may be tempted to wander down the aisles and pick up a bargain here and there, but it’s important to stick to your grocery list. If you have a particular item in mind, then add it to the list. This will help you to avoid spending too much money on items you don’t really need. It can also be beneficial to shop at different times of the week, depending on the best times and days to shop for certain items.

Vegetables and fruits can be bought on any day, but if you want to save money on meat, it’s best to shop on a Monday or Tuesday; this is when meat tends to be the least expensive. Dairy products and fish are usually best bought on a Friday.

## Buy in-season produce

Naturally, fresh produce is best when it’s in season. The issue is that due to the way certain foods are transported, it can make them taste better. When you purchase these items out of season, they may not be as fresh or nutritious. They may also be more expensive as they’re being imported from a different country. If you can, choose seasonal produce and save money in the long run.

While it’s not always possible to source all of your produce locally, most major supermarkets will specify the origin of their products. If you have the option, buy in-season produce, as it’s likely to be less expensive. It’s also expected to be at its nutritional peak, which means it will provide your body with more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

## Grow your own food

Even if you only have a small space to grow a few herbs or vegetables, you can still grow your own food. Depending on where you live, many plants can thrive in containers, so you can grow them indoors if you don’t have outdoor space. Some vegetables, like tomatoes and lettuce, are easy to grow and require very little space, making them perfect for growing indoors.
Some vegetables, like carrots and potatoes, require more space, but you can grow them in raised beds. If you have a sunny window that gets a lot of light, you can grow vegetables like lettuce and herbs. Even if you only have a small space, you can still grow your own food.

## Stick to dry goods and staples only

While fresh produce is nutritious and good for you, dry goods and staples like rice, oats, and beans are cheaper, more nutritious, and can last for a long time. Keep in mind that you should also consider the cost of shipping when purchasing online. Owing to the fact that it’s a dry good, shipping costs will be lower than if you purchased something perishable.
If you have the space and budget, purchasing staple foods such as rice and oats in bulk is a great way to save money. You can also buy certain items online if you can’t find them in your local store.

## Beans and legumes are a rock-star food group

Beans, peas, and lentils are packed with protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and most of them are very cheap. You can add them to salads, soups, stews, and stir-fries. Plus, they are easy to cook, and there are plenty of delicious bean recipes to try.
Most of these foods are also gluten-free, making them a great choice for anyone on a diet that avoids gluten. They are also very sustainable and eco-friendly, as they don’t require the use of fertilizers.

## Eggs are the ultimate protein package

Eggs are another great source of protein. They’re also cheap, easy to cook, and can be eaten many different ways. You can boil them, fry them, scramble them, or bake them; there are numerous ways to eat eggs.
You can easily add them to soups, stews, salads, and sandwiches. Plus, there’s a wide variety of egg recipes to try, so eating the same thing every day won’t get boring.

## Conclusion

Eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive, but it won't be cheap either. Just be sure to plan your meals ahead of time and be mindful of when you're shopping for groceries. You'll also want to buy mostly what is in season so you can save even more money. And if you can, try growing your own food or purchasing more dry goods and staples. Those are three great ways to save money while eating healthy.

These tips will help you to eat well on a budget, but most importantly, they will help you to eat well, full stop. Eating well will help you to feel better and more energized, and it will also help you to save money in the long run.
