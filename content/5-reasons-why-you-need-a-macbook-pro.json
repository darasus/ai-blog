Larger screens are better for photo editing and other intensive tasks. The standard model has a 13-inch screen, while the MacBook Pro has a 15-inch display. Both models have the same key travel distance and quiet sound, but the Macbook has a better keyboard with a richer red colour.

More memory means less lag while you\\u2019re working, scrolling through your social media feeds, or playing games. The Macbook Pro has a more powerful graphics card as well.

The Macbook Pro also has a Retina display, which means the pixels are so small that you can\\u2019t see them. This makes text easier to read, and images look more realistic.
