The best place to start is by asking yourself some questions. What do you want to achieve by eating cleaner? What bad habits do you want to curb or change? What parts of your eating habits are you currently happy with? What are your favorite meals or go-to snacks? From there, you can make a list of what exactly eating cleaner looks like to you.
