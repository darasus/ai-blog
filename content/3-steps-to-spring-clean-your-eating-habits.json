Clean eating is not about perfection or cutting out entire food groups at all; it\\u2019s about making more informed choices about the things you put into your body on a daily basis.

Is it cutting out processed foods entirely? Eating more vegetables and less meat? Cutting back on sugar? These definitions are all over the place, and ultimately, they\\u2019re up to you. The best place to start is by asking yourself some questions. What do you want to achieve by eating cleaner? What bad habits do you want to curb or change? What parts of your eating habits are you currently happy with? What are your favorite meals or go-to snacks? From there, you can make a list of what exactly eating cleaner looks like to you. That way, when you\\u2019re faced with a decision about what to eat, you\\u2019ll have a handy reminder of your goals and intentions.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Plan your meals for the week.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It\\u2019s estimated that as many as 70% of New Year\\u2019s Resolutions get abandoned within the first 6 months. If your plan is to eat cleaner, the best way to ensure that you succeed is to make it an easy transition. One of the easiest ways to make eating cleaner part of your normal routine is to plan out your meals for the week. If you know you\\u2019ll be too tempted to grab take-out on a busy night, or if you know you\\u2019ll simply run out of things to make for dinner, you\\u2019ll be more likely to default back to less healthy options. If you plan out your meals for the week, you can shop accordingly, save time, and make sure you always have healthy options on hand.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t be afraid of carbs.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Carbs have gotten a bad rap in recent years, but eating them in moderation is actually an important part of eating cleaner. Carbs provide your body with the energy it needs to function, it helps us feel full, and it\\u2019s an important part of a healthy, balanced diet. While there are many schools of thought that say eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain, there\\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. That said, people with certain health conditions like diabetes may need to adjust their carb intake and speak with their doctor about how much they should be eating. The best rule of thumb is to eat a diet that is rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits and limit the amount of sugar and processed foods you eat. In the end, the type of carb you eat doesn\\u2019t matter as much as the amount.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Commit to moving more.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One thing that\\u2019s almost certain to happen if you clean up your diet is that you will lose weight. This isn\\u2019t an unhealthy side effect, but it\\u2019s important to remember that it\\u2019s not the goal of eating cleaner. The goal is to feel good, have more energy, and be able to keep up with your family and life. If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, there are healthier ways than cutting out entire food groups or starving yourself. Eating cleaner is the first step, but it needs to be coupled with movement. You can walk more, take the stairs at work, do yoga or find another low-impact physical activity you love. Whatever you do, commit to doing it enough that it becomes a habit. Habits are hard to break, but they\\u2019re easy to form.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Eating clean doesn't have to be a one-time event. It's a lifestyle change that has benefits for your health and your wallet. Over time, eating clean can save you money because you won't be purchasing processed junk food that usually comes with a higher price tag. The best way to eat clean is to make it part of your daily routine. Clean eating doesn't have to be complicated or time consuming.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
