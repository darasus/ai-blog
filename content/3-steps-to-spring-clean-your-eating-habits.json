The best place to start is by asking yourself some questions. What do you want to achieve by eating cleaner? What bad habits do you want to curb or change? What parts of your eating habits are you currently happy with? What are your favorite meals or go-to snacks? From there, you can make a list of what exactly eating cleaner looks like to you.

While there are many schools of thought that say eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain, there\\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. That said, people with certain health conditions like diabetes may need to adjust their carb intake and speak with their doctor about how much they should be eating.

The goal is to feel good, have more energy, and be able to keep up with your family and life. If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, there are healthier ways than cutting out entire food groups or starving yourself. Eating cleaner is the first step, but it needs to be coupled with movement.
