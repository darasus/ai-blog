We see it every year, thousands of people vowing to eat clean and fit in exercise after a holiday season filled with excess. But what does that even mean anymore? Eating healthy is no longer as straightforward as it once was. There are so many different diets, food trends, and nutrition philosophies floating around out there today, how are you supposed to know what will work for you long-term and not just for one fleeting moment?\nIf the past several years have shown us anything, it\\u2019s that eating clean is here to stay. So instead of feeling like you\\u2019re trying on another new fad diet or eating trend, let this be your guidepost back to the basics of eating wholesome food that helps your body in the long run. Clean eating is not about perfection or cutting out entire food groups at all; it\\u2019s about making more informed choices about the things you put into your body on a daily basis.

Is it cutting out processed foods entirely? Eating more vegetables and less meat? Cutting back on sugar? These definitions are all over the place, and ultimately, they\\u2019re up to you. The best place to start is by asking yourself some questions. What do you want to achieve by eating cleaner? What bad habits do you want to curb or change? What parts of your eating habits are you currently happy with? What are your favorite meals or go-to snacks? From there, you can make a list of what exactly eating cleaner looks like to you.

One of the easiest ways to make eating cleaner part of your normal routine is to plan out your meals for the week. If you know you\\u2019ll be too tempted to grab take-out on a busy night, or if you know you\\u2019ll simply run out of things to make for dinner, you\\u2019ll be more likely to default back to less healthy options.

Carbs provide your body with the energy it needs to function, it helps us feel full, and it\\u2019s an important part of a healthy, balanced diet. While there are many schools of thought that say eating too many carbs can lead to weight gain, there\\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. That said, people with certain health conditions like diabetes may need to adjust their carb intake and speak with their doctor about how much they should be eating. The best rule of thumb is to eat a diet that is rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits and limit the amount of sugar and processed foods you eat.

This isn\\u2019t an unhealthy side effect, but it\\u2019s important to remember that it\\u2019s not the goal of eating cleaner. The goal is to feel good, have more energy, and be able to keep up with your family and life. If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, there are healthier ways than cutting out entire food groups or starving yourself. Eating cleaner is the first step, but it needs to be coupled with movement. You can walk more, take the stairs at work, do yoga or find another low-impact physical activity you love. Whatever you do, commit to doing it enough that it becomes a habit.
