  "intro": "Home cleaning in spring is the best time to thoroughly clean your home. As the weather gets warmer, so does our house. Dirt and grime that has accumulated over the long winter months begins to dissipate as we put away all of our heavy coats, hats, and gloves. With fewer layers to trap it, dust, germs, and other nasty particles are exposed for what they really are: gross! \nWe all know that a tidy home is a happy one. Keeping a tidy household at all times can be challenging. The pressures of work and other responsibilities often get in the way of keeping things clean and organized. But with some preparation and planning you can make spring home cleaning your primary focus instead of an afterthought. Here’s how…",
  "content": "## Choose a date and invite your friends\n\nA group effort can help to motivate you and stimulate conversation without the pressure of cleaning alone. Make it a social event by inviting your friends to join you in your spring home cleaning efforts. You can host a traditional house party or invite friends over for a spring cleaning social. A social is a fun event designed to encourage conversation and promote positive change.\n\n## Organize first, then clean\n\nOrganizing is the best way to make sure that you don’t miss anything or make a mess as you clean. Make sure that you have everything you need on hand before you get started. You should also have a plan on how you intend to tackle each room. If you have moved things around a lot, consider making a list of where things are so you don’t waste time looking for items.\nOnce you’ve finished cleaning each area, organize it. If you’ve moved furniture around, put it back where it belongs. This will make your house look a lot neater and be a lot easier to navigate.\n\n## Decide what you’ll keep and what you’ll toss\n\nBefore you go through each room, decide what you want to keep and what you want to toss.\nIf you find something that’s broken, mark it so that you remember to fix it later.\nIf you find something that you don’t know what to do with, mark it for donation.\nOnce you’ve finished cleaning each room, it’s time to put everything back where it goes. If you decide to throw something away, put it in a bag and mark it for donation or trash.\n\n## Plan your chores by room\n\nOnce you’ve decided what’s staying and what’s going, you can plan your spring home cleaning chores by room.\nBegin with the rooms that you use the most, such as the kitchen and bathroom, because these are the rooms that get dirty the quickest.\n\nNext, move on to the rooms that you use the least. These rooms can be cluttered and dirty because they are not in regular use.\n\nFinally, clean the rooms that are in-between. They get used somewhat often, but they also collect clutter.\n\nOnce you’ve finished cleaning one room, move on to the next. This will keep you from getting overwhelmed by the task at hand.\n\n## Check-in with your vacuum\n\nBefore you begin any cleaning, check that your vacuum is in good working order. If the filter and bag are full, or if the belt has come loose, it may not have the suction power that it needs to do a thorough job. If there is any sign of a problem, fix it before you start cleaning.\nDo you need to clean your vacuum? If you don't clean your vacuum often, the dirt and debris that is picked up by the machine can break down the motor, clog the filter, and make it harder to clean your home. A dirty vacuum can also irritate allergies and worsen asthma symptoms. \n\nA quick five-minute vacuum check-up can save you time and money down the road. It will also help your vacuum to pick up more effectively, which means less time spent cleaning and a cleaner home.\n\n## Dust and vacuum everything\n\nNext, tackle the dust and dirt in each room. Make sure that you dust everything that needs dusting, from light fixtures and ceiling fans to bookshelves and knick-knacks. You may also want to dust and clean the blinds and curtains, as these are often overlooked when cleaning.\n\nOnce you’ve finished dusting, vacuum the floors, upholstery and stairs. If you have a multi-story home, you may want to vacuum the higher floors first, then vacuum the lower floors after they’ve been picked up by the first vacuum.\n\nYou can also vacuum the ceiling fans, light fixtures and windowsills.\n\nNow is a great time to clean the gutters and vacuum the exterior of your house. This will help to prevent pests and mildew growth later in the year.\n\n## Declutter by category\n\nOnce you’ve finished cleaning each room, it’s time to declutter. Take each room one category at a time and clear out anything that is unnecessary.\nYou may want to start with the rooms that are used the most, such as the living room and kitchen, or you can do the rooms that you use the least first.\n\nBegin with the drawers, cabinets and closets, where you’ll find most of the clutter in your home. Next, tackle shelves and tables, and then move on to the walls. Finally, finish up by tackling the floors.\n\nOnce you’ve finished decluttering one room, move on to the next. This will prevent you from getting overwhelmed by the task at hand.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nSpring cleaning is not just about cleaning your home, it is also about re-energizing and rejuvenating your space. It’s a great time to take stock of what you have and what you need. It’s also a great opportunity to invite your friends over to enjoy your newly cleaned, fresh spring home."
