It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes. Unlike arbitration, mediation isn\\u2019t binding, which means that if you choose to continue with litigation after mediation, you will not be precluded from doing so. And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.

There are many different types of mediation, each with its own set of rules and expectations for participants. Understanding these variations is crucial to picking the right mediation process for your specific needs.\nMediation can be broadly divided into two categories: third-party mediation, where an impartial mediator helps parties reach agreement; and collaborative or problem-solving mediation, where the mediator acts as a guide who helps both parties negotiate in good faith and move towards a mutually beneficial solution.\nEach type of mediation has its own set of rules and requirements. In this blog post we\\u2019ll explore some of the most common forms of mediation, including general mediation, third-party neutral mediation, guided collaborative mediation, hybrid collaborative-neutral mediation and expert team services (ETS).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
