That includes everything from file transfer services to video conferencing. What\\u2019s more, the remote work trend has spilled over into many traditionally office-based roles, including software engineering and content strategy. With the rise of coworking spaces, virtual reality, and other remote work-friendly innovations, it\\u2019s clear that remote work has become an indispensable way of doing business \\u2014 and many companies have caught on. According to one survey of over 5,000 U.S. adults, over 60% of respondents reported working remotely at least some of the time.

And it\\u2019s not just marketing or IT teams who are being given the option to work remotely \\u2014 many companies have expanded their remote work offerings to include sales, finance, and other roles that traditionally require an office presence.\nAs more companies become aware of the quality talent available to them outside of the office, they\\u2019ll continue to expand their remote work policies.

As more companies adopt remote work and on-demand employee policies, more people are turning to independent contractor roles. While the distinction between the two can seem hazy, the difference lies in more than just the setting in which the work is done.\nPeople who work as independent contractors are often self-employed. They have very little in the way of benefits or security, but they are given autonomy in how they do their work and are responsible for paying their own taxes. On the other hand, gig economy workers are usually employed by a third-party company that offers them benefits and is responsible for their taxes.\nWhile many enjoy the flexibility of remote work, others are turning to independent contractor roles as a way to earn additional income.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Baby Boomers are helping change the workplace too\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As more millennials enter the workforce and demand remote work, companies are starting to adapt.
