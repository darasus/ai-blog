intro: >-
  With the release of new MacBook Pro models in October 2018, Apple fans
  have been wondering if now is the time to buy a Mac or not. New 15-inch and
  13-inch Pros are equipped with faster eighth-generation Intel Core i7
  processors, up to 32GB of DDR4 memory, and Radeon Pro graphics. There’s also
  True Tone technology for a more natural viewing experience, advanced speakers,
  a dynamic microphone and an upgraded fifth-generation Butterfly keyboard.

  But many users were disappointed to learn that Apple has ditched standard USB ports for USB-C – meaning you'll need adapters for most existing devices and accessories. And the price tag is hefty as well – starting at $1,799 for the base variant of the 13-inch model with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage (and going up to $3199 for the top version). 

  So if you’re on a budget but want something better than basic Chromebooks or Windows machines, here are our picks for The Top 12 Amazingly Low-Cost MacBook Pro Alternatives in 2019.
