Companies sell shares to investors in order to raise money to grow their business. The price of a share is determined by the company\\u2019s value \\u2014 and the higher a company\\u2019s value, the more valuable the shares. When you invest in a company\\u2019s stocks, you become a partial owner of that company. You have a financial stake in how the company performs, which means a company\\u2019s stocks are risky as well as rewarding. You can also invest in stocks through an index fund. Index funds buy stocks in a variety of companies and sectors, giving you a broad range of stocks to invest in.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Stocks 101\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are two types of stocks, preferred and common. You can buy either type of stock, but the preferred stocks are less common and therefore harder to come by. Preferred stocks are similar to bonds, in that they pay interest and have a set maturity date. Common stocks, on the other hand, pay no regular interest but have the potential to grow much larger in value over time. Common stocks represent a percentage ownership in the company, and the value of the stock depends on the company\\u2019s future prospects. There are also different types of stocks: equity, preferred, and convertible. Equity stocks are common stocks, while convertible stocks are a hybrid of equity and bonds. Preferred stocks are debt instruments that pay a set interest rate.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Benefits of investing in stocks\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Investing in stocks is a great way to build wealth over time.
