It is easy to get caught up in the moment and panic when it drops, or get overly excited when it rises. But if you take a step back and look at investing from a long-term perspective, things are not as scary. In fact, index funds are a great way to invest your money for the long run.\nIt is natural to have some fear or apprehension about putting your hard-earned money at risk by investing in the stock market. After all, many people witnessed the bursting of the dotcom bubble first hand and saw their retirement accounts plummet as a result. However, that does not mean you should avoid investing in stocks altogether\\u2014not even with recent recession still fresh on everyone\\u2019s mind.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Over the past decade, the S&P 500 index alone has created more than 200% value appreciation for its long-term investors. However, investing in the stock market is not as simple as buying stocks and forgetting about them for 10 or 20 years. It requires constant monitoring, research, and analysis to identify the right opportunities and manage risk. The Great Recession of 2007-08 is a perfect example of how risky investing can be. Many people who were new to investing suffered significant losses when their investments tanked during that time. If you\\u2019re thinking about investing your money in stocks, here are 10 things you need to know before doing so.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Diversifying your portfolio helps you manage risk and reduce the negative effects of a single investment falling dramatically in value.\nIf you invest your money in only one stock, mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), you\\u2019re exposed to the risk that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket. If that stock plunges in value, so does your entire investment. But if you diversify across different types of investments, it\\u2019s more likely that at least some of your holdings will not suffer a similar fate.\nA well-diversified portfolio includes numerous asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash; several sizes and types of companies; and perhaps even real estate and alternative assets like private equity or venture capital trusts.
