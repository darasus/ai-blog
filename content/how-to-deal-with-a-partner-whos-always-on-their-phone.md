It can be really frustrating when you're in a relationship with someone and it feels like they're always on their phone. If you're finding that your partner is constantly on their phone even when you're trying to spend time together, here are a few things you can do to try and change the situation.

Talk to your partner about how you're feeling and explain that you feel like you're being ignored when they're always on their phone. It's important to be honest about how you're feeling and to give them a chance to explain their side of things.

Try setting some ground rules about phone usage when you're together. For example, you could agree that neither of you will use your phones for the first hour after you get home from work. This will give you some quality time together without any distractions.

If your partner is always on their phone when you're out together, try asking them to put it away for a while so you can have their undivided attention. It's important to make sure that you're still spending quality time together even if it's just for a short while.

It can be difficult to change someone's behaviour, but it's important to communicate with your partner and to try and find a compromise that works for both of you.
