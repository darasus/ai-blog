intro: >-
  Now and again, your significant other will probably spend more time with
  their phone than with you. After all, it’s 2018, and smartphones are
  practically a necessity for anyone who wants to stay connected. But if your
  partner is glued to their cell 24/7, it can obviously become a source of
  tension between you two. It’s natural to feel a little jealous when someone
  you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And
  this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.

  If your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations — from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters. Being insecure and accusatory about something as innocent as checking messages isn’t likely to lead anywhere positive, after all. Here are some tips for dealing with a partner who’s always on their phone:

## Talk to Your Partner About It

The number one rule when it comes to dealing with a partner who’s always on their phone is to talk to your partner about it. If you’re feeling insecure about the amount of time they spend on their cell, voice those concerns to them. If they’re simply being social on their phone, it’s important to understand that. Similarly, if they’re actually cheating, you need to be aware of that so that you can take steps to protect yourself and your relationship. Learning the real reason behind your partner’s phone use can help you to address the situation and move forward.

## Establish Boundaries Together

If your partner has a legitimate reason for being on their phone all the time, like working long hours or being a single parent, you can actually go a long way toward eliminating the tension in your relationship by simply acknowledging the situation. You may not like the fact that they’re always on their phone, but once you understand that there is a reason for it, it can become a lot easier to let it go.
One way of doing this is by setting boundaries together. Rather than just complaining about your partner being on the phone all the time, you can negotiate with them to set aside certain periods of time when they have to put the cell down. This will obviously vary from relationship to relationship, but this kind of peaceful negotiation can go a long way toward preventing arguments.

## Don’t Be Partners with Benefits

If you’re worried that your partner is cheating on you through their phone, it might be a good idea to consider whether you have any reason to be suspicious at all. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t trust your intuition, but it’s important to be realistic about the situation.
In other words, before you accuse your partner of being on the prowl for a new significant other, consider whether you yourself are being unfaithful. If you and your partner are both frequently on your phones, it’s not unreasonable to assume that you could simply be talking to the same person.
Don’t use the fact that your partner is always on their phone as an excuse to start an affair of your own. This will only complicate your relationship further, and could end up causing you more problems than you’re already having.

## Communicate and Be Clear

If you and your partner have a good reason for being on your phones all the time, but you’re finding that it’s creating tension between you two, communicate your feelings. Don’t expect your partner to simply know that you’re feeling neglected, even if you have a good reason for feeling that way. Instead, tell them how you feel.
If you’re feeling neglected, let your partner know. If you’re feeling insecure about the amount of time your partner spends on their phone, say so. It may be tempting to believe that you’re not entitled to feel any kind of way, but this is a bad mindset to have. Be honest with your partner and let them know how you feel. That way, they can hopefully come up with a solution that works for both of you.

## Don’t Assume the Worst

If your partner has a legitimate reason for being on their phone all the time, don’t assume that they’re doing something dirty. As we discussed above, the most likely explanation is that they’re simply being social.
If you’re feeling increasingly insecure around your partner’s phone use, it’s important to take a step back and analyze the situation. Are you assuming the worst when there’s no real reason to do so? Are you being a little bit of a control freak?
If you can’t seem to control your insecurities, consider speaking to a therapist about it. This can help you to separate your emotions from the facts of the situation, and will almost certainly help you to feel more confident in your relationship.

## Find a Distraction Together

If you and your partner are spending too much time on your phones, consider finding a distraction together. This could be anything from taking up a new hobby together to going out for dinner more often.
You and your partner are in a relationship, and therefore you should be spending time together. If you’re always staring at your phones and ignoring each other, it’s unlikely that you’ll have a very happy relationship.
This doesn’t mean that you have to abandon your cell phones altogether. Rather, simply try to find a healthy balance between using your phones and spending time with your partner.

## Conclusion

Whether you’re always on your phone or your partner is, the most important thing to remember is to be respectful of each other. It’s easy to get caught up in the fact that your significant other is always on their phone, but it’s important to remember that this is probably not about you. You’re both adults, and you should be able to spend time on your phones without feeling guilty about it.

If you or your partner is always on their phone, don’t blame each other for it. Instead, try to find a healthy balance between using your phone and spending time together. Doing so will lead to a happier relationship, and will make it easier for you both to deal with this issue.
