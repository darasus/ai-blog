  "summary": "The first step in getting your dog to wait is to get him to stop following you when you leave the room. It’s important that you don’t physically keep your dog in one place by holding his collar, wrapping a leash around his chest, or using any kind of physical restraint. This can create an association in the dog's mind that you doing this means he should stay put. You can use shaping techniques to help your dog learn to wait for longer periods of time.",
