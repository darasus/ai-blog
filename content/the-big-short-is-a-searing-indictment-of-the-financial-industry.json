At just 32 years old, he was a renowned expert on theoretical physics, having published several academic papers on black holes and quantum theory.\nThis is also when he met and married his first wife, Jane Wilde. Their marriage only lasted 14 years but proved to be an influential period for both of them. It was during this time that Stephen began to experience increasing difficulty with his motor functions and speech. The couple divorced in 1995 and it\\u2019s believed that this is when Hawking began to see ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) as something other than a curse \\u2014 instead it became a catalyst for him to leave behind a legacy of knowledge that would outlive him.\nA few years after his divorce, in 2003, Hawking had been able to complete \\u2018A Brief History of Time\\u2019 which became an international bestseller with over 10 million copies sold. In 2014, the film \\u2018The Theory of Everything\\u2019 was released based on the book by Jane Hawking about her marriage with Stephen which further cemented his fame as one of the most brilliant minds in history today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The Korean sextet has made a name for itself as not just another boy band but one that plays its own instruments and has choreographed dance routines that are so intricate they sometimes require special stage lighting.\nArmed with these weapons, BTS has twice cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart with its Love Yourself series.

This is why many people assume they are only famous because of social media and pandering ads (which is true).
