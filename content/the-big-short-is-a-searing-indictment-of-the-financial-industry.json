But there are some rappers who are using their fame to make a difference in the world by speaking out about problems that need to be addressed: social injustice, poverty, drug abuse, child exploitation and other serious issues. These artists are making a conscious effort to use their music to make a positive impact on society rather than just focusing on things like materialism or promiscuity.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days.

In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.
