First, it offers trust by enabling transparency across the network. This can be especially valuable in supply chains where the entire journey of a product or shipment can be authenticated. Second, it offers collaboration between partners. Rather than requiring multiple organizations to operate on the same network, blockchains can be implemented as a private blockchain that allows partners to authenticate their transactions with one another. This can be especially helpful in the healthcare industry where data needs to be shared securely between different organizations. Finally, blockchain offers speed.

First, it can be used to establish trust between different stakeholders, like customers, IT teams, and vendors.

Second, blockchain can be used to automate contract management by enabling parties to embed business rules into the network. For example, a rule may state that a customer can\\u2019t approve payment for a project until their review is complete. Third, blockchain can be used to review completed work.
