Occupational dog toys are designed to help keep your dog mentally stimulated so they don\\u2019t get bored and start chewing on your shoes or digging up the yard. But even with all of these fantastic innovations, most dogs will eventually get tired of playing with their toys and will look for something more interesting. This is where training comes in!\nTo train your dog means to instruct them in some behavior that you want them to repeat consistently in different situations. Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like \\u201Csit\\u201D or \\u201Cstay,\\u201D or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard.
