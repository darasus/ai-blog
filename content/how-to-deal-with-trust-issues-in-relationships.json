Certain things may indicate that you\\u2019re dealing with a manipulative or abusive partner, and you need to be aware of those things and know when you need to get out.

It takes time and effort to build a healthy relationship and trust takes time, too.

If you let those things out in the open, it can help you feel better about the relationship and help your partner feel more secure and safe, too.

Instead, try to take a step back and give the relationship more time to grow and develop.
