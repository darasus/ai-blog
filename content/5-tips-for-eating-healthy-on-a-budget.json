Eating healthy can be expensive and challenging. The cost of healthy food has gone up while the cost of unhealthy food has gone down. But this doesn\\u2019t mean that eating healthy is impossible; it just means we all need to get a little bit more creative.\nEating well on a budget can be challenging, but it isn\\u2019t impossible. Making smart choices about what you buy as well as how you cook your food can make a big difference in how much money you spend on food each month and how healthy your diet is at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Having a meal plan will help you avoid overspending on impulse purchases of unhealthy foods. It will also help you make the most of what you have in your pantry so that you don\\u2019t waste food and end up spending money unnecessarily.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you don\\u2019t know what to cook, take a look at your budget and see what ingredients you can afford. Then, try to come up with a few different meal options based on what you have. For example, if you have a lot of eggs and bananas, you could make egg and banana pancakes for breakfast, a banana and egg salad for lunch, and an egg and banana frittata for dinner. This will help you make the most of what you have while also providing you with a well-rounded, healthy diet.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Buy In-Season Produce\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to save money while eating healthy is to buy produce that is in season.

Many stores sell produce all year round, so it can be difficult to tell which produce is in season. The best way to know for sure is to look at the price tag or check the sticker on the produce.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Buy in Bulk\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to save money while eating healthy is to buy in bulk. If you have a nearby bulk food store, they may have lots of options for healthy foods. Buying in bulk is a great way to save money on food because you can buy more and spend less per unit. If you have a kitchen, you can also buy bulk dry goods like beans, lentils, and rice. These foods can be used in many different ways and last for a long time.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Make sure that the bulk dry goods you buy are of high quality. Some bulk dry goods may be less expensive, but they may also be less nutritious. You may want to buy in bulk dry goods that are more expensive but more nutritious, but you can also buy smaller bags of cheaper, less nutritious bulk foods and just use smaller amounts in your recipes.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Look For Deals and Coupons\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to save money while eating healthy is to look for deals and coupons. This can be done online or by reading the Sunday paper.

This isn\\u2019t always easy, especially if you\\u2019re trying to eat healthy because many coupons are for unhealthy foods. You can try to avoid this by bringing your own reusable bags to the store. You can also avoid having to decide between healthy things and unhealthy things at the store by bringing your own food from home.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Eat Beans & Lentils\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to eat healthy on a budget is to eat beans and lentils.

You can eat them on their own, add them to salads and stews, or even make them into burgers. You can make other healthy foods, like eggs and rice, cheaper by adding beans and lentils. You can also make some unhealthy foods, like hot dogs and burgers, healthier by replacing them with beans and lentils. You can even use beans and lentils in desserts like cookies and brownies.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Try Vegan Food Options\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Another way to eat healthy on a budget is to try vegan food options.
