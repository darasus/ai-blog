It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s great that they want to explore the world around them and make new discoveries every day, but what isn\\u2019t so great is when they keep you up at night with their shenanigans. Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company. Fortunately, training your dog to go to bed is fairly easy with some dedication from you!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
