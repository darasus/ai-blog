## The benefits of walking

Walking is a great way to get active and stay fit. It’s one of the most accessible forms of exercise; you can do it pretty much anywhere and at any time. You can walk indoors or outdoors, on a treadmill, while listening to music, with a friend, or with your family. Walking is an aerobic activity, which means it helps your heart and lungs work better. It also increases your metabolism, helping you burn more calories throughout the day.

Walkers can reduce their risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Walking boosts mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. It also promotes better sleep, which is essential for a healthy immune system.

## The benefits of running

Like walking, running is another aerobic exercise that can help you burn more calories, improve your heart and lung health, reduce stress, and improve your sleep. Running is a high-impact activity, so it may be a better choice for those who are new to exercise. You may have heard that running is better than walking for weight loss, but in truth, you can get pretty much the same benefits from either one. The real difference between the two is that running is more intense and requires more effort. This can be helpful if you’re trying to challenge yourself with a high-intensity workout. But if you’re just starting out (or even if you’re a veteran runner), high-intensity workouts can cause injury. That’s why it’s important to start out slow and build up your endurance.

## How much running is enough?

The amount of running you should do depends on your fitness level and goals. If you want to improve your health and fitness, you can start with one-minute intervals alternating with one-minute rest intervals. As you get fitter, you can increase the length of the intervals. Moderate runners can build up to 30 minutes per session, while serious runners can increase their time to an hour or more.

If you’re training for an event like a marathon, you’ll need to do even more running, with more intensity and fewer breaks. One running session per week may be enough for many people, but two or three sessions per week may be better for others.
If you want to lose weight, you’ll need to do more than one session per week.

## The benefits of walking and running together

Walking and running aren’t completely different exercises. They use many of the same muscles and set off the same metabolic reactions in the body. So if you’re alternating between the two, you may get more benefits than if you were doing just one or the other. For example, combining walking and running can help you improve your aerobic fitness faster. You may also see faster improvements in your body weight, body shape, and body composition.

Because walking and running are both aerobic activities, they work together to increase your metabolism. When you walk or run, your body burns fat as its main source of energy. As you walk or run more often, you’ll increase your metabolism and have more energy throughout the day.

## Should you walk or run?

You can walk or run to get fit, but walking and running together will provide more benefits than just one or the other. And as we said above, walking and running can help you improve your aerobic fitness faster than doing just one or the other alone. Plus, you’ll also get some strength training benefits, as well.

Generally, walkers burn more calories per hour than runners do. But runners will burn more calories overall because they’re getting more exercise during their leisure time than walkers do during the same amount of time.

That said, if you’re trying to lose weight, running may be better for you than walking. That’s because there are no calories in running, whereas walking burns fewer calories than running. The more intense running session may also help you work off a few extra pounds.

## Run for weight loss, walk for fitness

As we’ve seen above, walking and running together can help you get fit and lose weight. But it’s important to note that walking is a moderate-intensity exercise while running is high intensity. While both forms of exercise can help you lose weight, they may have different effects on other health aspects of your body. Moderate exercise like walking is associated with better mental health than high-intensity exercise like running, for example.

So if you’re hoping to improve your mental health and mood, walking may be a better choice for you. And if you’re hoping to get fitter and lose weight, running may be the better option for you.

In general, walking and running can provide many of the same benefits. But walking may be a better choice for people who want to improve their mental health, while running may be a better choice for people who want to lose weight.

## Final words

Walking and running are great ways to get more active, improve your health, and lose weight. All you have to do is get out there and start moving! Whether you’re a beginner or higher level exerciser, walking or running can help you stay fit.

You can choose which activity is best for you based on your fitness level, goals, and availability. Whether you’re hoping to improve your mental health, lose weight, or get fitter, walking or running is a great way to get there.
