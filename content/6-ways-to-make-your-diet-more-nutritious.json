Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast tend to be healthier in general. They have less diabetes, less hypertension, and less obesity than people who don\\u2019t eat breakfast.\nYou should eat breakfast no later than 9 AM. Ideally, you should eat breakfast before 8 AM so that the body has enough time to process the meal before you head off to work. This will ensure that you have plenty of energy and that your metabolism is at its best.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t forget your veggies\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Vegetables are essential when it comes to a healthy diet. They are loaded with vitamins and minerals that are essential for good health. Vegetables are also very low in calories, making them ideal for weight loss. You should aim to eat at least two servings of vegetables per day. A serving is roughly half a cup of vegetables, or two carrots.\nVegetables can be eaten as a side dish with your meal, a snack, or added to a meal that you are cooking. Vegetables are incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. In fact, some dishes would be incomplete without them. Potatoes, for example, are used in many popular dishes.\nVegetables should ideally be eaten raw, as cooking them will usually diminish their nutritional value.

While it is true that you do need more of certain nutrients, it is also true that an excess of these will cause more harm than good. A good rule of thumb is to follow what your body is telling you. For example, you might be able to eat two or three servings of vegetables a day. You can also use a portion guide to help you.\nYou should also keep in mind that calories will remain calories no matter which nutrients they are made of. You can have a really nutritious meal with a ton of vegetables, but if you eat too much of it, it will be just as bad as if you had a meal full of empty calories.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Choose whole grains\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Whole grains are foods that are made from the entire grain, including the germ and the bran.

Whole grains have more fiber, protein, B vitamins, and iron than grains that have been milled and refined.\nYou can eat whole grains in many different ways. You can add oats to your breakfast cereal, eat some whole wheat bread, or even add some quinoa to your salad.\nYou should also make sure to look out for foods that say \\u201Cmade with whole grains\\u201D on the label. Many companies have started to use this label to show that their products are made with whole grains.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t forget the protein\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Protein is essential to good health, and very few foods contain it naturally. This means that you need to make sure you are getting enough protein in your diet. A good general rule is to aim for one protein source per meal. When you choose your protein, make sure it is lean.\nYou can get your protein in many different ways. You can add beans to your salad, have a chicken breast with your meal, or even drink protein shakes if you don\\u2019t have the time to sit down and eat a meal.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Stay away from processed foods\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Processed foods are any foods that have been modified from their natural state. Many processed foods are high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats and low in nutrients.

It\\u2019s used to catalyse the fermentation process when baking sourdough bread, giving it a distinct sour flavour. Traditionally, starter takes weeks to make, but there are much faster methods using packaged yeast \\u2013 see below. However you choose to make your own starter, the process is relatively straightforward and once you get the hang of it, an easy routine to keep up.\nSourdough has numerous benefits over other kinds of bread. It is easier for your body to digest than white bread because it doesn\\u2019t have any gluten in it (gluten can be challenging for people with a sensitivity or intolerance). Sourdough doesn\\u2019t have any added sugars either; just natural sugars from the fermentation process. It also has more protein than standard breads, which means it keeps you feeling fuller for longer.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
