Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast tend to be healthier in general. They have less diabetes, less hypertension, and less obesity than people who don\\u2019t eat breakfast.\nYou should eat breakfast no later than 9 AM.

You should aim to eat at least two servings of vegetables per day. A serving is roughly half a cup of vegetables, or two carrots.\nVegetables can be eaten as a side dish with your meal, a snack, or added to a meal that you are cooking. Vegetables are incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. In fact, some dishes would be incomplete without them. Potatoes, for example, are used in many popular dishes.\nVegetables should ideally be eaten raw, as cooking them will usually diminish their nutritional value.

While it is true that you do need more of certain nutrients, it is also true that an excess of these will cause more harm than good. A good rule of thumb is to follow what your body is telling you. For example, you might be able to eat two or three servings of vegetables a day. You can also use a portion guide to help you.\nYou should also keep in mind that calories will remain calories no matter which nutrients they are made of.

You can add oats to your breakfast cereal, eat some whole wheat bread, or even add some quinoa to your salad.\nYou should also make sure to look out for foods that say \\u201Cmade with whole grains\\u201D on the label.
