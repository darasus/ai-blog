Organic produce is grown with fewer pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and to you and your family. Organic meat is often raised on smaller farms that don’t use antibiotics or hormones to speed up the process. Organic dairy is more nutritious because cows are raised on small farms that allow them to graze on pastures.
