Vegetables are incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. In fact, some dishes would be incomplete without them.

For example, you might be able to eat two or three servings of vegetables a day. You can also use a portion guide to help you.\nYou should also keep in mind that calories will remain calories no matter which nutrients they are made of.

Contestants are asked to make pastry-based dishes that often feature unusual or difficult techniques, and are judged on appearance, taste and originality. In each episode they face two different challenges: a Signature Bake where they must create something using a specific ingredient or theme as inspiration; and a Technical Challenge which might see them making croquembouche or another difficult dish.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
