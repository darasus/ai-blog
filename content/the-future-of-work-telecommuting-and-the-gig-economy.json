  "summary": "Telecommuting is an alternative work arrangement that allows employees to perform their work away from the company’s physical location. It is expected to grow even more in the future as companies look for ways to attract and retain employees who don’t want to commute or relocate for a job. Many telecommuters are self-employed, while others work as employees of large firms. With fewer cars on the road and less energy consumption, the environment will benefit from increased telecommuting.",
