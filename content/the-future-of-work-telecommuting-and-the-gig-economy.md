summary: Telecommuting is an alternative work arrangement that allows employees
  to perform their work away from the company’s physical location. It is
  expected to grow even more in the future as companies look for ways to attract
  and retain employees who don’t want to commute or relocate for a job. Many
  telecommuters are self-employed, while others work as employees of large
  firms. With fewer cars on the road and less energy consumption, the
  environment will benefit from increased telecommuting.
intro: >-
  Telecommuting and the gig economy are two of the most talked about trends
  in the future of work. These are both new ways for people to find work that
  better fits their lifestyle and interests.

  Working from home, also known as telecommuting, has been around for decades but was only adopted by a small group of people because it was not widely accepted or understood. In the gig economy, workers find short-term jobs with different companies instead of working as an employee with one company for a long period.

  Both trends impact how and where we work, who is looking for work, and what skills are needed to succeed in this environment. Are you ready to adapt your career in response to these trends? END

## Telecommuting

A telecommuter is an employee who performs their job remotely using telecommunications technology, usually from home. Telecommuting is an alternative work arrangement that allows employees to perform their work away from the company’s physical location.
Telecommuting has been around for decades but is only now reaching critical mass, as more and more people are interested in working from home. It is expected to grow even more in the future as companies look for ways to attract and retain employees who don’t want to commute or relocate for a job.
Telecommuting also has many benefits for society and the environment. With fewer cars on the road and less energy consumption, the environment will benefit from increased telecommuting.

## What is telecommuting?

Telecommuting is the act of performing one’s job at home, away from the office, by using telecommunications technology such as the Internet. The term was coined in the late 1980s to refer to the concept of working from home using computers to link into the organizational computer network.

Telecommuters often are skilled professionals who earn more money than person who earns the minimum wage, even though they never set foot in an office. Many telecommuters are self-employed, while others work as employees of large firms. Some telecommuters work full time, while others work only part-time. Some telecommute occasionally, while others work from home full time.

## The Gig Economy

A gig economy is an economic model in which people are employed on a short-term basis, often for the delivery of services such as ridesharing, online trading, freelance work or other odd jobs, rather than in regular positions with regular hours at regular rates of pay.
The key factor behind the growth in the gig economy is the rise in technology and access to the Internet. This allows people to find short-term work with different companies through online platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, rather than apply for full-time positions.
Gig workers are often highly skilled and are able to pick and choose the jobs they want and are best suited to. Many people are working in the gig economy while they are between full-time jobs or in between careers.

## Job Skills for the Future of Work

The future of work will bring many changes and new types of jobs. A few of the skills that will be in demand include:
- Computer skills: People who can use computers in new and exciting ways will be in demand in the future of work. Professionals who know how to use artificial intelligence and machine learning will be in high demand. People who can write apps and create great websites will also be in demand.
- Critical thinking and problem solving: As technology advances, the need for people who can solve problems and think critically will increase. This means that people will be needed to solve problems in fields like the environment, healthcare, and other areas. Critical thinkers will be needed to solve problems in new ways and make the world a better place.
- Language skills: Professionals who know a second language will be in demand. This includes people who are fluent in different languages and bilingual people who can translate content into different languages.

## Bottom line

The future of work is upon us, and it’s important for people to adjust their careers to fit the new way of working. The best way to do this is to assess your current skills and how they apply to the future of work and then look for ways to build on those skills.
