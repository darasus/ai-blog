In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings.

After all, it\\u2019s 2018, and smartphones are practically a necessity for anyone who wants to stay connected. But if your partner is glued to their cell 24/7, it can obviously become a source of tension between you two. It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters. Being insecure and accusatory about something as innocent as checking messages isn\\u2019t likely to lead anywhere positive, after all. Here are some tips for dealing with a partner who\\u2019s always on their phone:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
