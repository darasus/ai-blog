However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program.

It\\u2019s ideal for individuals who want an alternative to litigation or other traditional dispute resolution processes. Unlike arbitration, mediation isn\\u2019t binding, which means that if you choose to continue with litigation after mediation, you will not be precluded from doing so. And while it doesn\\u2019t involve a third party making a decision on your case, as in quasi-negotiation, mediation is not a fiasco or popularity contest. Rather than having another person make the final call about what\\u2019s fair, mediation gives each side the opportunity to advocate for themselves and their interests while listening respectfully to the other party\\u2019s concerns as well.

Parties agree to have a neutral third-party called a mediator act as an intermediary, bringing opposing parties together to resolve their dispute and avoid expensive and time-consuming court proceedings.\nIf you are involved in a lawsuit or other legal conflict, mediation can be beneficial in several ways. It can help you resolve your dispute faster and cheaper than going to trial. Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future. Lastly, mediation may give you more control over how your dispute is resolved, as opposed to leaving that up to an unpredictable judge or jury.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
