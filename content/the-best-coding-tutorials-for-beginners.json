This digital skill gives you the power to create websites, apps or video games from scratch without having to pay someone else to do it for you. Not only that, coding can be used in lots of different industries and jobs. It\\u2019s also a great way to make money online as a side project if you have other ambitions. However, if you\\u2019ve never coded before it can seem like an impossible challenge. It isn\\u2019t something you can Google or Netflix your way through \\u2014 it requires dedication and practice. Thankfully, there are plenty of free resources available on the Internet that will help you get started with coding basics and build your skills over time. The following article highlights some of the best tips for beginners who want to learn how to code in 2018 and beyond.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

You can create a database using simple file-based formats or you can use more advanced options such as object-oriented database management systems (ODBMS) or graph database management systems. Depending on what type of database you want to create and your specific needs, there is likely an ideal programming language for you.\nThe Go programming language is one option that is worth exploring if you are looking for a great general-purpose programming language but one with special focus on database programming. Many programmers value Go\\u2019s simple syntax, its special built-in support for strings and its powerful built-in concurrency primitives.
