After all, no one is born a coding expert; that designation is something you must earn by constantly challenging yourself to improve your skills. However, reading and understanding code isn\\u2019t always easy, especially when it\\u2019s written in a foreign language or has certain nuances that are beyond your current understanding.\nReading code like an expert means more than just knowing what words mean and their general significance. It also means being able to dive deeper into the syntax of how those words are put together so that you can understand what they mean in context and intention.

However, not all of them manage to capture hearts and minds like Python has. This dynamic general-purpose programming language has become one of the most commonly used since its release in 1991 and remains so today.

The best network administrators manage to plan for the future by anticipating problems from the present and creating plans to deal with them before they arise. However, this can be difficult when working in a fast-paced industry with so much change happening at once.\nIn response to this challenge, Go\\u2014a simple programming language developed by Google that makes it easier to create software packages\\u2014is gaining traction as an ideal tool for creating programs for operating and managing computer networks. Built from C++, Golang was designed as a simpler alternative that makes it easy to manage performance requirements and reduce the number of potential bugs without sacrificing performance or functionality.\nGo is not just a new tool but also a new way of writing code: It\\u2019s statically typed and uses interfaces rather than inheritance or other OOP techniques. If you\\u2019re interested in using Go to make your career as a network administrator easier or even transition into becoming one, read on for more information about why you should learn Go for Network Administration and the best places to get started with your learning today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
