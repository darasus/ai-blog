intro: >-
  As soon as you start working, you feel like procrastinating. The idea of
  your project seems so fascinating that you can’t wait to get back to it.
  Unfortunately, the time when you least want to work is exactly when you need
  to work. 

  Working feels like a burden and every task seems like an uphill struggle. You hate yourself for putting off something that is so beneficial for your future and your career. You’re also terrified about what will happen if you don’t finish this assignment by tomorrow. You don’t want to fail the course, lose your scholarship and end up homeless somewhere in a strange city where none of your friends live. However, all of this seems much more appealing than getting back to work on the project again; it’s even more appealing than thinking about how difficult life will be without the degree or scholarship at home.

## The Procrastination Equation

There are two sides to every equation, so let’s start with the positive one. TPD or Time Preference refers to the degree to which you value your time. The higher your time preference is, the more you value your time and are willing to spend it on activities that bring you closer to your goals. It also means that you don’t like spending your time on activities that don’t bring you any value.

The other side of the equation is EAP or the Expected Appreciation of Productivity. It refers to the degree to which you appreciate the benefits of your productivity. When EAP is high, you’re motivated to get things done, when it’s low, you just sit and do nothing.

## What Causes Procrastination?

There are many potential causes of procrastination, but they all come down to two things:

- A bad feeling.
- A bad promise.

The bad feeling is a sense of discomfort that you experience while working on a task that you don’t really want to do. The bad promise is the promise you make to yourself that you’ll do something you really don’t want.

The formula for procrastination is pretty simple: the less you want to do something, the more you promise yourself to do it. When the bad feeling of doing something outweighs the bad promise you’re making to yourself, you feel so uncomfortable you just can’t continue working.

## How To Overcome Procrastination?

The first step in overcoming procrastination is to accept that it’s normal and that everybody does it.
The second step is to address the underlying causes of your procrastination.
You can do that by doing the following:

- Identify the problem.
- Find evidence for and against your hypothesis.
- Come up with alternative solutions and test them.
- Implement the solution that works best.
- Stay vigilant and keep track of your progress.

When you follow this process, you’ll not only overcome your procrastination, but you’ll also learn how to identify and address its underlying causes so that it doesn’t happen again. This will help you build better habits and make you more productive in the long run.

## Productivity Tips For Freelancers

- Make A Plan - A big part of being productive is making a plan. You should know what you want to accomplish, when and how. Having a plan gives you something to strive towards and helps you stay focused.
- Write Down Your Goals - It’s important to set goals and write them down so that you can track your progress towards them. If you write down your goals, you’ll be more likely to achieve them.
- Create A Routine - Having a routine is a good way to stay organized and keep focused on the important tasks. Having a routine will make it easier to manage your time and stay organized so you can get everything done.
- Meditate - It may sound silly, but meditation is a great way to relax and get focused. Even a few minutes of meditation a day can help you relax and focus on the task at hand.
- Be Social - While it’s important to be productive, it’s also important to take time for yourself and enjoy your life. Having friends and going out is a great way to let off some steam and relax.

## Conclusion

The secret to overcoming procrastination is to identify and address the causes of your procrastination. You can do that by identifying the problem, gathering evidence for and against your hypothesis, coming up with alternative solutions and testing them, and implementing the solution that works best.

When you follow this process, you’ll not only overcome your procrastination, but you’ll also learn how to identify and address its underlying causes so that it doesn’t happen again. This will help you build better habits and make you more productive in the long run.
