  There’s a lot of mystery and fear around investing your hard-earned
  money. For many people, that means they never get started. But investing your
  money instead of just saving it can have a big impact on your financial
  future. In fact, time is the enemy of your money -- the sooner you begin
  investing for your future, the better off you’ll be. 

  Working with as little as $10 per month or an initial investment of $100 per month, you can begin to invest for your future. While it’s not necessarily easy to become a successful investor (it does take time and effort), there are simple things you can do to get started on the right foot with minimum risk. Below are 10 investing tips for beginners that will help set you on the right path toward achieving great returns on your savings:

## Diversification is key

As a beginner, you may think that by investing only in a few select stocks that you’re more likely to hit it rich. But the opposite is true: you increase your risk of major losses. For example, if you invest all of your money in one company’s stock and they go out of business, you lose everything.
Diversification reduces risk by spreading your money across different types of investments so that if one sector goes down, you don’t lose everything. A good rule of thumb is to put your money into a wide variety of investments, and don’t put more than 10% of your money into any one investment.

## Don’t invest in anything you don’t understand

If you don’t understand how a certain investment works or how it will generate a profit, you probably shouldn’t invest in it. In fact, you should absolutely stay away from any investment you don’t understand.
Investments that you don’t understand are more likely to lose you money than generate a profit. For example, if you invest in penny stocks, you’re likely to lose your money.
Investments like penny stocks are high-risk and aren’t for beginners.
If you don’t understand what you’re investing in, you’re better off investing in low-risk, low-reward options like CDs or savings accounts.

## Owning a home is still the best investment

You’ve probably heard that stocks and bonds are the best investment. While that may be true over the long haul, real estate has always been the best investment in terms of one-time profit.
Owning your home is still one of the best investments you can make. It doesn’t generate cash flow like stocks do, but it will increase in value over time thanks to inflation and demand.
If you buy a home and keep up with your mortgage payments, you have the potential to make a big profit when you go to sell it down the road.

## Know your fees and costs

Most people are completely unaware of the fees associated with investing. For example, most mutual funds charge an upfront fee, and a percentage of the profits you earn from your investment.
Your best bet for low-cost investment is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are low-cost, and you can buy and sell them just like stocks.
Most brokerage accounts charge you a percentage of the total amount of money you have in them. So the more money you have in your account, the more you’ll pay in total fees.
Investing only what you’re comfortable losing is crucial. If something unexpected happens and you can’t make your investment payment, you’re better off not investing in it in the first place.

## Take a small amount of cash to invest and stick to it

As a beginner investor, you’re not going to hit the jackpot right away. You’re going to have to be patient and let your money grow.
Investing a small amount of money each month, starting as soon as you can, is the best way to start growing your investments.
If you can spare $10 per month, start an investment account with a robo-advisor like Wealthsimple. You can open an account with as little as $10 per month.
If you can only spare $50 a month, that’s okay too. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.
That said, don’t go wild investing too much at once. You don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket.

## Stick to your plan, no matter what

As a beginner, it can be tempting to try to time the market and predict when the stock market will rise or fall. But you never know when the next downturn will come around, or how long it will last.
Investing is a long-term game. It may not feel like it as you consistently check your investments and watch the market, but you have to remember that the market will go up over time.
You should always revisit your investment plan. Making regular contributions, investing in low-cost ETFs, and setting aside money in case of an emergency are all great ways to start investing now.

## Bottom line

Investing is a skill that can take time to develop, but it’s one that anyone can learn with practice.
If you start investing early, you can use the power of compound interest to your advantage and grow your money faster.
Don’t be intimidated by investing. With the right tools, it can be easy and accessible for anyone.
All that’s left to do is create a plan and start investing as soon as you can.
