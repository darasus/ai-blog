  "title": "Qtum: The Smart Contract Blockchain",
  "summary": "Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be transferred directly from one user to another on a peer-to-peer network. There are no banks or middlemen involved in these transactions, and the network is decentralized. This means that there is no central authority that governs or controls these networks. The network uses Bitcoin’s blockchain as a trustless and decentralized system for verifying transactions. The Qtum network uses two different proof of stake consensus algorithms for mining new coins and validating transactions. This allows Qtum to combine the best of both worlds, so to speak.",
  "intro": "Qtum is a hybrid of two of the most prominent and promising blockchain projects currently available: Ethereum and Bitcoin. While both may seem like unrelated projects at first glance, they share some commonalities. Both offer different takes on blockchain technology with unique pros and cons—and Qtum manages to combine both while enhancing their benefits.\nWe’ll dive into more details about both of these projects in this article, but let’s start with a brief overview: \nEthereum offers an accessible platform for developers who want to build smart contracts or other applications that run on top of a blockchain network. On the other hand, Bitcoin serves as a digital currency that can be sent through the internet directly from one user to another with no third party or intermediary.",
  "content": "## What is Ethereum?​\n\nEthereum is a blockchain project that provides developers with the tools they need to build decentralized applications. Ethereum is also a programming language that developers can use to build these applications.\nWhat sets Ethereum apart is its flexible functionality. Ethereum’s blockchain can be programmed to complete any type of decentralized functionality. For example, developers can use Ethereum to create entire countries that exist on the blockchain. These countries can run their own governments, create their own currencies, and even send citizens to space.\nEthereum is a bit more complicated than Bitcoin, so we’ll look at it in a bit more detail. Ethereum’s blockchain is built to complete what’s known as a “smart contract.” A smart contract is essentially an agreement that is recorded on the blockchain. Once the contract is written and stored on the blockchain, it can’t be altered or tampered with.\n\n## What is Bitcoin?​\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that can be transferred directly from one user to another on a peer-to-peer network. There are no banks or middlemen involved in these transactions, and the network is decentralized. This means that there is no central authority that governs or controls these networks.\nBecause no one governs the Bitcoin network, it’s also a bit more anonymous than other payment networks like credit cards. However, this also means that the government can’t track the use of Bitcoin the same way they could track a credit card transaction.\nPeople can create “wallets” to store and send Bitcoin. These wallets are accessible through a computer or smartphone and connected to the internet.\n\n## Qtum: The “Best of Both Worlds”​\n\nQtum is a decentralized application platform that combines some of the best aspects of both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Qtum’s network uses Bitcoin’s blockchain as a trustless and decentralized system for verifying transactions.\nThe network uses Ethereum’s virtual machine for executing smart contracts and building decentralized apps. The virtual machine is known as the Qtum Virtual Machine (QVM) and runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nAs a result of this hybrid functionality, Qtum can complete functions that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum can accomplish on their own.\n\n## How Does Qtum Work?​\n\nThe Qtum token is used for staking payments and securing the network. The Qtum blockchain uses two different proof of stake consensus algorithms for mining new coins and validating transactions.\nThis allows Qtum to combine the best of both worlds, so to speak. The network uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm to verify transactions and a proof of work consensus algorithm to complete smart contracts.\n\n## Why Is Qtum Worth Watching?​\n\nQtum is a unique blockchain project that shares several similarities with Ethereum. Both networks feature a virtual machine that allows developers to create smart contracts.\nHowever, Qtum uses Bitcoin’s blockchain to verify transactions. This means that Qtum can combine the best features of both networks and provide a more accessible and cheaper alternative.\nThis could help Qtum expand beyond the Ethereum network and attract new users and developers.\n\n## Who’s Behind Qtum? The Company and Its Founders​\n\nQtum’s team and founders are a mix of veterans and newcomers in the blockchain space. Noam E. Felder, the co-founder and CEO of Qtum, has been in the blockchain space since 2011. He has worked with several notable tokens and projects such as Qtum, Qt, Quantum, and QRL.\nFelder also holds a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington.\nQtum’s other co-founder and president of the network is Patrick Dai. Dai is a former Chinese equity investor who has served as an advisor to several companies in the blockchain space.\n\n## How to Buy and Store Qtum​\n\nIf you’re interested in buying Qtum, the first thing you’ll need to do is create a wallet. You can store Qtum in a hardware wallet like the Trezor or Ledger Nano S or on a software wallet like MyEtherWallet or Trust Wallet.\nBecause Qtum uses Bitcoin’s blockchain, you don’t need to buy BTC as well. You can buy and store Qtum in its own wallet.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nQtum is a hybrid blockchain project that combines Bitcoin and Ethereum’s best features. This unique combination makes Qtum a more accessible and cheaper alternative to the Ethereum network.\n\nQtum is worth keeping an eye on as it continues to grow and expand. It could become a major player in the blockchain space and help propel the industry forward."
