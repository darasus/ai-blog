It appears that it\\u2019s because these companies have found a new and innovative way to leverage technology to their advantage. These companies have been using blockchain technology as part of their growth strategy, and it\\u2019s working for them.\nThe popularity of the word \\u201Cblockchain\\u201D has grown substantially over the last couple of years. For example, you might recall the crypto craze in late 2017 when Bitcoin prices skyrocketed. That\\u2019s because blockchain is what made cryptocurrencies possible in the first place, serving as a trustless digital ledger to track transactions without needing an intermediary like a bank or other third party.\nUnfortunately, many people still don\\u2019t fully understand what blockchain is or why it matters. But regardless of where you stand on this technology, you should know that blockchain isn\\u2019t just useful for cryptocurrency anymore\\u2014it can be used to improve almost any business model.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
