It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an earlier version of the blockchain code named \\u201CC Haskell\\u201D and later changed to \\u201CCardano\\u201D. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
