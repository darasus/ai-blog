There are no banks or middlemen involved in these transactions, and the network is decentralized. This means that there is no central authority that governs or controls these networks. The network uses Bitcoin’s blockchain as a trustless and decentralized system for verifying transactions. The Qtum network uses two different proof of stake consensus algorithms for mining new coins and validating transactions. This allows Qtum to combine the best of both worlds, so to speak.",
