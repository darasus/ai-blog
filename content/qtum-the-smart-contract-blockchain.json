In this post, we\\u2019ll take a look at Stellar, an under-the-radar crypto that could break out in Q2 and beyond.\nWe know it\\u2019s still early days for crypto, but we think there\\u2019s also genius insight locked away in these digital tokens. So much of what makes a coin great doesn\\u2019t come from its technology or usage as much as its real-world potential.\nWhen evaluating a cryptocurrency for long-term investment, we ask ourselves: How does this token solve a real problem? Does it have the potential to be adopted by many users? Is there an opportunity for this coin to appreciate in value? If you can answer yes to all of these questions, you may be interested in investing in Stellar \\u2014 here\\u2019s why:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
