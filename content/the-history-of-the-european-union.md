The European Union is a unique economic and political partnership between 27 European countries that together cover much of the continent. The EU was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries that trade with one another become economically interdependent and are more likely to avoid future conflict. The European Coal and Steel Community was established in 1951, and the Treaty of Rome creating the European Economic Community was signed in 1957.

Since then, the EU has grown to become an important global actor. It has developed a single market – ensuring the free movement of goods, capital, services and people – and has introduced a common currency, the euro, which is now used by 19 of its 27 member states. The EU has also played a leading role in international efforts to promote peace and stability, combat climate change and poverty, and protect human rights.

The EU is built on a unique set of values – respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are enshrined in the EU’s founding treaties and are reflected in all of its actions.

The EU is based on the rule of law. This means that every action taken by the EU is founded on treaties that have been approved by all member states. The treaties are binding and must be respected by all member states.

The European Union is founded on the principles of democracy. Decisions are taken as openly and as closely to citizens as possible. The European Parliament, which is directly elected by citizens, plays a central role in the democratic life of the EU.

The European Union is committed to protecting human rights. These rights are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, which all EU member states have ratified. The EU also works to promote and protect human rights around the world.
