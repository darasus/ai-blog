  The European Union is a unique hybrid of intergovernmental and
  supra-national institutions. Its origins lie in post-war cooperation between
  governments centered on trade and the goal of a more peaceful, prosperous and
  stable Europe. The EU has developed into a dynamic union with its own legal
  personality, institutions and policies covering many areas such as: foreign
  policy, competition policy, education, justice, agriculture and fisheries,
  health services and research. This article explores the history of the
  European Union and its continuing evolution as an ambitious supra-national
  organization with global ambitions to become "a League of Nations."

## Origins of EU Cooperation

The idea of European integration has been around since the early 20th century. It was given fresh impetus with the end of the Second World War and the realization that another war between European nations would be unthinkable. The first intergovernmental organization was the Coal and Steel Community (1951) followed by the European Economic Community (1958), the European Atomic Energy Community (1958), the European Coal and Steel Community (1951), the European Nuclear Research Community (1954), the European Investment Bank (1958), and the European Convention on Human Rights (1950).
The main aim of the European Economic Community (EEC) was to create a common market in which goods, services, people, and capital could move freely, and the signatories to the Treaty of Rome agreed to work towards “ever closer union”.
While the members of the EEC were all democracies, there was an awareness that another war between European countries would be unthinkable.

## The European Economic Community (EEC)

The European Economic Community (EEC) was established with the signing of the Treaty of Rome (1957) by France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The EEC was the first step towards greater European unity, creating a common market in which goods, services, people, and capital could move freely.
The EEC also had a social dimension, introducing an 8-hour working day, paid holidays, and the abolition of child labour.
The EEC was initially all about free trade and economic integration, but the signing of the Treaty of Rome also set a course towards political union.

## The Single European Act

The Single European Act (SEA) was signed in 1986 and came into force two years later. The SEA was the culmination of efforts to push for greater political and economic integration. It aimed to create a single market by 1992 through the removal of barriers to trade and the harmonization of economic and social policies. The SEA also called for the creation of a European Union (EU) with its own currency and a system of majority voting.
The SEA was very controversial and was almost derailed by the French Parliament. But the political will to push ahead prevailed, and the SEA was eventually ratified by all twelve member states, bringing the EU a step closer to becoming a reality.

## The Maastricht Treaty: Establishing the EU We Know Today

The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 was the next major step in European integration. It was the first time that the EU’s member states had agreed to work towards “ever closer union”, a phrase that had been absent from the Treaty of Rome. With the Maastricht Treaty, the EU became the first supranational organization in the world to have its own currency: the euro.
The Maastricht Treaty also created the European Council, a forum for regular meetings of the heads of state and government of EU member states, as well as the European Council, which brings together the heads of state and government of all EU member states (except for the EU member state that holds the Council presidency), the President of the European Commission, and the President of the European Parliament.
The Maastricht Treaty also introduced the “three-legged stool” of EU governance, establishing the European Council, the Council of the EU, and the European Parliament.

## The Amsterdam Treaty and the Introduction of the Euro

The Amsterdam Treaty was signed in 1997 and came into force the following year. The treaty brought about many changes, including the expansion of the EU to include: Austria, Finland, and Sweden; the first-ever EU enlargement; the inclusion of a new chapter on EU foreign and security policy; and a new intergovernmental body, the Western European Union (WEU).
The Amsterdam Treaty also formally introduced the euro as the single currency of the EU. To date, 19 EU member states have adopted the euro.
The Amsterdam Treaty can be seen as the EU’s coming of age. It was the first time that the EU had a single foreign policy, albeit still very limited in its scope. As Anthony Giddens, one of the leading figures in the European integration movement, put it: “The treaty is an attempt by the member states to create a framework in which they can work together even more closely on issues of common concern.”

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: EU Summing-Up

For a long time, Europe was plagued by wars, tensions, and rivalries. After a long process of integration, it has now become a unique international organization that aims for peace and prosperity in a continent where war has been “an endless nightmare”.
The success of the European Union is an example of how countries can work together to solve their problems and promote their common interests. In the EU, we can find examples of the good, the bad, and the ugly. While the EU has promoted peace, prosperity, and democracy, it has also shown how the interests of some nations can trump the interests of others.

## Key Takeaway

The European Union is a unique hybrid of intergovernmental and supra-national institutions. Its origins lie in post-war cooperation between governments centered on trade and the goal of a more peaceful, prosperous and stable Europe. The EU has developed into a dynamic union with its own legal personality, institutions, and policies covering many areas such as: foreign policy, competition policy, education, justice, agriculture, and fisheries, health services and research.
