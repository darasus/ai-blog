Building a Hibernate application is not difficult, but there are a few key steps that you need to take in order to get it up and running correctly. The first step is to download the Hibernate library and add it to your project. Once you have done this, you need to create a hibernate.cfg.xml file and add it to your classpath. This file will contain all of the configuration information for your Hibernate application.

The next step is to create your hibernate.properties file. This file will contain your database connection information, as well as any other properties that you want to set for your Hibernate application. Once you have created this file, you need to add it to your classpath as well.

The next step is to create your SessionFactory. This is done by calling the buildSessionFactory() method of the SessionFactory class. This method takes in a configuration object, which is created by passing in your hibernate.cfg.xml file. Once you have created your SessionFactory, you can then start creating your Hibernate application.
