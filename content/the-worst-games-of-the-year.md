intro: >-
  The video game industry is filled with great games. These are also some
  of the most challenging and difficult ones to make. Cracking the code on how
  to build a well-crafted and engaging video game requires practice, ingenuity,
  skill, and patience. But not every developer is up to the task. Some simply
  fail at creating an entertaining experience for players. This list compiles
  some of the disappointments from 2018 that failed to meet an acceptable
  standard of quality. 

  These are the worst games of 2018, broken down by category and listed in no particular order. Some might have had good intentions or interesting concepts, but fell short in their execution. If you’re looking for something new to play this year, stay away from these titles as they won’t give you your money’s worth or much satisfaction beyond finishing them once (if that).

## Action Games

Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey – This open-world action-adventure game has a lot of content, but that’s where the positives end. The story is forgettable, the combat is clunky, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. In addition, the game comes with serious technical issues, which is surprising given its long development cycle. The new dialogue system, which allows players to choose between multiple options to advance the plot, is particularly bad. There are loads of bugs, and the system is prone to creating strange situations where you can’t proceed further with the game. For example, at one point, I couldn’t progress because someone thought I was in love with them, but I couldn’t figure out how to tell them otherwise. The game is also very buggy and crash-prone, and its visuals are below average.

## Fighting Games

Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition – The latest installment in Capcom’s legendary fighting game series. Sadly, it’s just more of the same with a few superficial changes and no real improvement over its predecessor. Most of the modes are extremely barebones, which is disappointing given the game’s premium price. What’s more, SFV is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that have yet to be addressed. The game’s netcode is also poor; so much so that it’s impossible to take the online mode seriously. Capcom promises that it will address the issues in the coming months, but it’s hard to take them seriously when they let things get this out of control in the first place.

## Racing Games

Forza Horizon 4 – Rare’s latest open-world racing game is fun to play, but it’s marred by microtransactions. The game’s progression system is unfairly stacked in favor of players who are willing to spend money on car parts and mods. It’s especially annoying given that the game itself costs a lot of money. Even if you don’t engage in the game’s pay-to-win economy, you’ll still be at a disadvantage compared to those who do. There’s also the poorly-implemented online racing, which has been marked by numerous disconnects and server issues. What’s more, the developers have been unhelpful in fixing the issues. It’s a shame, too, because the game is otherwise a lot of fun to play.

## Role-playing Games

Fallout 76 – It’s unfortunate that Bethesda’s latest open-world RPG is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches, including visual errors and quest-breaking bugs. These issues are especially evident in the game’s multiplayer mode, where players sometimes get stuck in the environment or suffer from sound and visual desynchronization. Other reports suggest that the game’s server is underpowered, which may explain why it’s struggling to keep up with all the online traffic. Bethesda has said that it will work on fixing the issues, but we’re yet to see any noticeable improvement. Fallout 76 is also marred by an uninteresting story and an underwhelming setting, which makes it feel like a step back for the series.

## Sports Games

FIFA 19 – EA’s annual football game is fun to play, but it has become stale and uninteresting over the years. What’s more, FIFA 19 is plagued by microtransactions. It’s the same old FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) with a few small changes that don’t address the core problem with the system: it’s just too easy to spend real money on virtual items. EA’s promise to change the system hasn’t materialized either; the current iteration is just as bad as its predecessors. There have also been reports of visual bugs and glitches, which is surprising considering how long EA had been in development on FIFA 19.

## Strategy Games

Total War: Three Kingdoms – Creative Assembly’s latest strategy game is a big disappointment, especially after the high bar set by its predecessor. The game’s campaign mode is extremely shallow, and it has a poor user interface. What’s more, the AI is flawed, and the game doesn’t support multiplayer. The game’s visuals and performance are far from stellar as well. All in all, this is a disappointing game from a series that’s known for high quality and challenging gameplay. Hopefully, CA learns from its mistakes and comes up with something better next time.

## Conclusion

2018 has been an interesting year for video games. It has seen the release of several blockbuster titles, such as God of War, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. It has also seen the rise of battle royale games, such as Blackout (Black Ops 4) and Ring of Elysium. It has also seen the fall of several franchises, such as Assassin’s Creed, and the rise of new IPs.

What has also become apparent from this list of the worst games of 2018 is that there is no shortage of bad games. With so many coming out every year, there are some that simply fail to meet even the most basic standards of quality. Some are buggy, poorly made, and poorly designed. Others try too many gimmicks that don’t work out as intended. In short, it pays to be a vigilant gamer and do your research before buying a game.
