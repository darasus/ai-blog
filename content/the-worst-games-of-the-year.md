The worst games of the year are those that are simply not fun to play. They may be buggy, have poor graphics, or just be plain boring. Here are ten games that were released this year that fit this description.

1. "Aliens: Colonial Marines"

This game was hyped up to be the next big thing in the "Alien" franchise, but it turned out to be a buggy mess. The graphics were poor, the AI was terrible, and the overall game was just not fun.

2. "Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel"

The third installment in the "Army of Two" series was also a major disappointment. The game was plagued by technical issues, and the co-op gameplay that was the series' trademark was not well implemented.

3. "Call of Duty: Ghosts"

The latest "Call of Duty" game was also a letdown. The multiplayer was unbalanced, the campaign was short and uninspired, and the overall game just felt like more of the same.

4. "Dark"

This action-RPG from German developer Realmforge Studios was an ambitious but ultimately flawed game. It had some good ideas, but poor execution and a lack of polish held it back from being great.

5. "Defiance"

This MMO shooter from Trion Worlds was a buggy, uninspired mess. The game had technical issues at launch, and the content was thin and uninteresting.

6. "DmC: Devil May Cry"

The reboot of the popular "Devil May Cry" series was a major disappointment. The game was plagued by technical issues, and the combat was not as fluid as it should have been.

7. "Dust 514"

This MMOFPS from CCP Games was a buggy, unpolished mess. The game had technical issues at launch, and the overall experience was just not fun.

8. "Fuse"

This cooperative shooter from Insomniac Games was a major disappointment. The game was buggy, the level design was poor, and the overall experience was just not fun.

9. "God Mode"

This third-person shooter from Old School Games was a buggy, unpolished mess. The game had technical issues at launch, and the overall experience was just not fun.

10. "Star Trek: The Game"

This tie-in to the popular movie franchise was a major disappointment. The game was buggy, the combat was dull, and the overall experience was just not fun.
