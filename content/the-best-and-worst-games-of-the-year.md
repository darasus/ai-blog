The best games of the year are those that manage to be both entertaining and challenging. They're the ones that make us think, "Just one more turn," while also providing enough of a sense of accomplishment that we feel like we've really accomplished something when we finally put them down. The worst games of the year, on the other hand, are those that are either too easy or too frustrating, offering little in the way of either enjoyment or satisfaction.

This year, there were plenty of both good and bad games. For every masterpiece like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there was a dud like Batman: Arkham Knight. Here are our picks for the best and worst games of 2015.

The best games of the year:

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - There's a reason this game has won so many Game of the Year awards. It's simply one of the best RPGs ever made, with a vast open world to explore, hundreds of hours of side quests to complete, and a deeply engaging story that will keep you hooked until the very end.

Bloodborne - From Software's latest game is a tough as nails action RPG that will test even the most hardcore gamers. It's not for the faint of heart, but those who persevere will be rewarded with one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of the year.

Super Mario Maker - One of the most creative and innovative games of the year, Super Mario Maker allows players to create and share their own Mario levels. It's a must-play for any fan of the iconic platforming series.

Fallout 4 - Bethesda's latest open-world RPG is another massive game that will keep you busy for hundreds of hours. It's not without its flaws, but its vast world and wealth of content make it one of the best games of the year.

The worst games of the year:

Batman: Arkham Knight - A disappointing conclusion to Rocksteady's excellent Batman trilogy, Arkham Knight is marred by a number of technical issues and a frustratingly difficult Batmobile sections.

Assassin's Creed: Syndicate - The latest Assassin's Creed game is a step backwards for the series, with a dull setting and uninspired gameplay. It's still worth playing if you're a fan of the franchise, but it's far from the best game in the series.

Mortal Kombat X - A step down from the excellent Mortal Kombat 9, Mortal Kombat X is a disappointingly shallow fighting game that lacks the depth and variety of its predecessor.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 - A complete mess of a game, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is plagued by technical issues, bad level design, and a general feeling of being unfinished. Avoid it at all cost.
