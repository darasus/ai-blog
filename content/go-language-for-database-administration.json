This can be helpful when trying to figure out why a query might be slow, or why a table is full.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"6 Reasons to use Go for DBAs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Go is a statically typed language, which means that the type of data expected in each line of code must be specified.

This makes it a good choice for scaling applications to support large numbers of users.\nIt has built-in support for JSON parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web apps. Go has good support for big data. This is partly because Go makes it easy to distribute data across multiple machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary.\nGo supports interoperability with other languages via its standard library and its C-like syntax.

Finally, unlike other languages, the Go standard library doesn\\u2019t require the use of a database.

Because of this, many developers have turned to web scraping in order to extract the information they need from websites without having to manually search or filter through everything individually. Luckily for you, Python is a perfect language for getting started with web scraping!
