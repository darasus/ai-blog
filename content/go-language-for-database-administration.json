This makes it a good choice for scaling applications to support large numbers of users.\nIt has built-in support for JSON parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web apps. Go has good support for big data. This is partly because Go makes it easy to distribute data across multiple machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary.\nGo supports interoperability with other languages via its standard library and its C-like syntax.

Finally, unlike other languages, the Go standard library doesn\\u2019t require the use of a database.

However, not all of them manage to capture hearts and minds like Python has. This dynamic general-purpose programming language has become one of the most commonly used since its release in 1991 and remains so today.
