This makes it a good choice for scaling applications to support large numbers of users.\nIt has built-in support for JSON parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web apps. Go has good support for big data. This is partly because Go makes it easy to distribute data across multiple machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary.\nGo supports interoperability with other languages via its standard library and its C-like syntax. This makes it easy for DBAs to integrate with other technologies such as Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go has good support for big data\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While all modern programming languages claim to be good for big data, Go actually delivers on this promise. The Go standard library has a suite of tools that make it easy to process large datasets and scale them up to take advantage of distributed processing. The standard library comes with a Hadoop MapReduce implementation that can process data in parallel across a cluster of machines.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The Go standard library also contains critical tools like the Hashing package and the Standard Library package that make it easy to implement common data structures such as a binary tree or a hash table. Finally, unlike other languages, the Go standard library doesn\\u2019t require the use of a database.

Go offers a good choice for integrating with various databases, including those used by other applications. This can be useful if a company wants to make use of data stored in a legacy database, or if it wants to ingest data from another system. Go also makes it easy to access web services. This makes it a good language for building microservices.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go has built-in support for concurrency\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While all modern programming languages offer some support for concurrency, Go makes it particularly easy and efficient to implement. In most programming languages, developers have to manage the way different processes can access and modify data. This can be a complex and error-prone process.

This can significantly reduce the complexity of writing concurrent code.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go has good support for SQL\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Most database management systems support SQL as a standardized way of retrieving and managing data.
