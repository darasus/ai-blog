This makes it a good choice for scaling applications to support large numbers of users.\nIt has built-in support for JSON parsing and using HTTP endpoints, which are both important for modern web apps. Go has good support for big data. This is partly because Go makes it easy to distribute data across multiple machines, as well as scale up to more powerful systems if necessary.\nGo supports interoperability with other languages via its standard library and its C-like syntax. This makes it easy for DBAs to integrate with other technologies such as Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go has good support for big data\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While all modern programming languages claim to be good for big data, Go actually delivers on this promise.

The standard library comes with a Hadoop MapReduce implementation that can process data in parallel across a cluster of machines.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The Go standard library also contains critical tools like the Hashing package and the Standard Library package that make it easy to implement common data structures such as a binary tree or a hash table. Finally, unlike other languages, the Go standard library doesn\\u2019t require the use of a database.

Go offers a good choice for integrating with various databases, including those used by other applications. This can be useful if a company wants to make use of data stored in a legacy database, or if it wants to ingest data from another system. Go also makes it easy to access web services. This makes it a good language for building microservices.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go has built-in support for concurrency\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While all modern programming languages offer some support for concurrency, Go makes it particularly easy and efficient to implement.

Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files. The same concept is true for distributed computation: instead of running an application within individual software running on your operating system (like when you run a program on Word or Excel), it involves breaking down the processes into smaller parts that can each be run independently on different machines at once.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
