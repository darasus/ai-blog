In fact, Python has become the most popular programming language used by scientists today.\nA scientific computing software package called \\u201COrange\\u201D inspired the creation of Python because its creator wanted to make something easier to use. Other programming languages like MATLAB were not user-friendly enough for general-purpose scientific computing so Guido van Rossum created his own version of it.

What started as a niche skill used by software developers is now a marketable and relevant skill for almost every industry. It has become so ubiquitous that even the Department of Labor has highlighted coding as one of the fastest growing skills in demand.\nCoding is most commonly thought of as the ability to create websites, apps and software. However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. The type of coding you choose to learn may have different applications depending on your interests, career trajectory and personal strengths.
