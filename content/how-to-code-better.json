This ability to execute multiple processes simultaneously leads to faster and more efficient results. Applications like artificial intelligence, image recognition, and natural language processing are all fields that can benefit greatly from parallel computing techniques. Because of this demand for parallel computing techniques, there are many programming languages available specifically for this purpose. The Go language is one such example.
