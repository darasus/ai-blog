It\\u2019s one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it\\u2019s a core language used by websites and apps.\nThe popularity of JavaScript comes from the fact that it can be used pretty much anywhere, on any device, and in any programming environment. You can use it to build websites, automate tasks, create apps, and more.\nIn the early days, JavaScript was used primarily for front-end design \\u2013 the visuals and user interface of a website.

Every time you use the variable, it will hold a different piece of information. The next time you use it, the information will be different again.\nYou can use variables to store information that you\\u2019ll use regularly, like a person\\u2019s name or a price.

Or you could use it to store information that never changes, like the title of your project or the name of your company.\nYou can write constants using uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, or a combination of these.
