You can use it to build websites, automate tasks, create apps, and more. JavaScript is a programming language that can be used anywhere, on any device, and in any programming environment.

It\\u2019s one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it\\u2019s a core language used by websites and apps.\nThe popularity of JavaScript comes from the fact that it can be used pretty much anywhere, on any device, and in any programming environment. You can use it to build websites, automate tasks, create apps, and more.\nIn the early days, JavaScript was used primarily for front-end design \\u2013 the visuals and user interface of a website. Now, however, it\\u2019s used for much more than that.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Variables\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`In programming, a variable is a placeholder that stores information that can change over time. This could be a number, a letter, a word, or any combination of symbols.\nIt\\u2019s important to understand that the information stored in a variable will change over time. Every time you use the variable, it will hold a different piece of information. The next time you use it, the information will be different again.\nYou can use variables to store information that you\\u2019ll use regularly, like a person\\u2019s name or a price. You can also use them to store information that will change, like the current date or the amount of sales you make each day.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Constants\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`A constant is very similar to a variable in that you can use it to store information. The difference is that once you\\u2019ve stored data in a constant, that information won\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s like a bookmark that you can use to keep track of important information without having to change the actual text itself.\nYou might use a constant to store a mathematical formula so you can use it over and over again. Or you could use it to store information that never changes, like the title of your project or the name of your company.\nYou can write constants using uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, or a combination of these. Be sure to put each constant on a new line so that it\\u2019s easier to read and understand.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Strings\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`A string is a group of characters that you group together to form a single unit. These characters can be letters, numbers, symbols, and other characters.\nYou might use a string to group together several letters, like your first and last name, to form your full name.\nYou can create strings anywhere in your code and use them to store and display text. Strings are very useful for storing anything that you might want to output later in your code, like a product name or a person\\u2019s name.\nWhen you create a string, it\\u2019s important to remember that you can\\u2019t change the letters inside it. It\\u2019s like a bookmark that you\\u2019ve written on a piece of paper and taped to your computer screen.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Operators\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`An operator is a sign or symbol that tells your computer to perform a specific task.\nFor example, when you add two numbers together, you\\u2019re using the addition operator.\nEqually, when you subtract two numbers, you\\u2019re using the subtraction operator.\nYou can use operators in TypeScript to make your code more efficient. They allow you to perform tasks like mathematical calculations and conditional tests in a single line of code, which means less typing and more time for other tasks.\nOperators are like building blocks for your code. If you understand them, you can use them to create more complex and interesting code.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conditional Statements\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`A conditional statement is a code segment that only runs if a certain condition is true. You can use conditional statements to control the flow of your code, meaning you can make it go in different directions depending on certain outcomes.\nConditional statements can include certain conditions, such as when a number is greater than or less than another number, or whether a specific piece of data exists.\nYou can use conditional statements in TypeScript to make your code run in different ways depending on a certain state of the program. For example, you can use a conditional statement to run a certain piece of code only when a certain condition is true.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Loops\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Loops are a series of instructions that are repeated several times. You can use loops to perform certain tasks over and over again, which is great if you have a large amount of data to process.\nLoops can be either conditional or non-conditional. A conditional loop will only run when a certain condition is true, while a non-conditional loop will run regardless of the situation.\nLooping is a very common programming technique. You can use loops to process large amounts of data, run some code multiple times, and more.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Objects\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`An object is a collection of properties, values, and data that you can store together in one place.\nYou can use objects to store pieces of information that are related to each other, like a person\\u2019s name and their address. You can also use objects to group together pieces of data that you want to perform an action on, like a group of numbers or letters.\nYou can use objects in TypeScript to group data together so that it\\u2019s easier to understand and work with.

It\\u2019s a core language used by websites and apps, and it can be used in just about any programming environment. In addition to that, JavaScript is also used for front-end design, making it even more versatile and useful.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"JavaScript has many helpful features that make it easier to work with, including variables, constants, strings, and operators.
