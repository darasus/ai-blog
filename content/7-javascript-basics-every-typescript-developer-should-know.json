Files are stored as strings or bytes. If you have used other programming languages before, this will be familiar to you. In Java, there are two separate ways of working with files: standard streams and the new \"File\" class introduced in version 1.1 of the language.

These mobile devices are not just used for voice calls or text messaging. They can now be used to capture images, record videos, and listen to music. Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems.

For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further.
