Spring is a popular Java application framework and Enterprise platform. It is used by millions of developers around the world. Spring is a lightweight framework that provides many features for web and enterprise applications.

Spring is an open source framework created by Rod Johnson in 2003. Spring is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and very rapidly.

Spring framework makes the life of developer easier by providing support for various features such as transaction management, security, data access, web services, email, task scheduling, and many other Java EE features.

The Spring framework is based on two design principles - Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming.

Dependency Injection:

The Spring framework implements the Dependency Injection principle which states that an object should not be responsible for creating or managing its dependencies. Instead, this responsibility should be delegated to another object. This object is typically referred to as an "Injector".

Aspect Oriented Programming:

The Spring framework also implements the Aspect Oriented Programming principle which states that an application should be designed in such a way that its functionality can be divided into distinct parts called "aspects". Each aspect should be implemented as a modular unit that can be independently configured and reused.
