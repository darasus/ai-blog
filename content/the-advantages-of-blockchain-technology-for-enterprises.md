## What is blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized and encrypted digital ledger that’s used to track transactions between parties. It’s designed to be a trustworthy source of transaction data due to its decentralized network, meaning that no single person or organization can “own” the database. This makes the blockchain a tamper-proof database that can be shared across companies, industries and geographies where there has been no trust or permission needed.

Each transaction logged on a blockchain is validated by network users who run software to solve complex algorithms that verify the transaction. Once the transaction has been verified, it’s added to the blockchain as a “block,” with each block being linked to other blocks to create a chain. Each block is timestamped and contains transactional data, including transaction amount, parties involved, asset type, and any other relevant details. This makes blockchain technology particularly useful for supply chain management, asset tracking, and digital advertising.

## Supply chain transparency

A recent article on the Harvard Business Review explored how blockchain technology can help businesses become more transparent by leveraging its ability to track and trace goods and services. When applied to supply chain management, blockchain can help companies more accurately document and track assets and transactions that occur along the supply chain. This can be especially useful for industries like food and pharmaceuticals where trust and transparency are imperative to maintaining a healthy customer base. To reduce the risk of product recalls, companies can use blockchain to record and track information about their vendors and distributors, including product expiration dates, batch numbers, and production details. 

Similarly, blockchain can help track and trace assets that are used in business operations, such as company vehicles or computer software. This can provide businesses with an added layer of security by recording vehicle VIN numbers or tracking software licenses to make sure assets are only being used by employees who have permission to use them.

## Blockchain for ad fraud detection

Another example of how blockchain can add transparency to businesses is through its ability to help detect ad fraud. A report from the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) estimated that brands lost $19.8 billion to ad fraud in 2018 and predict that figure will rise to $33 billion in 2019. Blockchain technology can help businesses track ad spend and malicious activity by creating an immutable record of ad spend and impressions across the supply chain, including third-party networks and exchanges. Blockchain also enables advertisers to automate cross-network reconciliations, making it easier to detect fraudulent activity. Blockchain can help ensure that ads are being served as intended, which can help brands avoid fraudulent activity that could damage their reputations.

## Identity and access management

Companies also use blockchain technology to manage customer identity and access across their networks. This can be especially useful for organizations that serve B2B customers, such as travel agencies, healthcare providers, and financial institutions. Blockchain can help these businesses manage access and identity by recording access requests and granting permissions across a decentralized network. This is helpful for organizations that manage employee access and identity across a number of departments and systems. Blockchain can also help businesses securely store customer identity information like social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and passport information for a fee.

## Smart Contracts

Another way blockchain is used for trust and transparency is through its ability to execute “smart contracts.” A smart contract is a computer program that’s designed to execute contractual terms automatically. This means that blockchain can be used to automate business processes and agreements, including revenue sharing, content delivery, arbitration, and other tasks that previously required human intervention. Blockchain can also help businesses avoid costly disputes by creating programmed and self-enforcing contracts that include verifiable terms and conditions that can’t be altered or changed. This ensures that all parties are held to the same standards and that contractual terms can’t be tampered with by humans.

## Asset tracking and verification

Another valuable use for blockchain is for tracking and verifying goods and services. This can be especially helpful for industries like mining and agriculture that rely on third-party verification to ensure that products meet certain standards. Blockchain can be used to track goods from production through transportation, to distribution and eventually to customers. This process can be especially helpful for businesses that source materials or products from remote areas or regions where centralised verification and documentation may not be available.

Similarly, blockchain can be used to verify the identity of employees or contractors who work on behalf of a company, such as construction workers or service providers. This can help businesses reduce fraudulent activity and hold contractors accountable for their work.

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology has the potential to transform how companies operate by adding trust and transparency to business processes. This can be especially useful for B2B companies that rely on trust and verification from suppliers and customers. The ability to track and trace assets, manage customer identity and access, and execute smart contracts make blockchain a powerful technology that businesses can’t afford to ignore.
