In mediation, the neutral third party, the mediator, facilitates conversation between the parties involved in the dispute with active listening and exploration of interests. The mediator will not take sides, but instead will help each party to express their interests and explore the other party\\u2019s interests through a process of questions, observations, and reflections. Through active listening and exploration of interests, the mediator helps the parties to understand one another and find common ground where possible. Mediation is a voluntary process.

This is different from other dispute resolution processes where parties work towards a solution without necessarily understanding one another.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why doesn\\u2019t mediation work for some disputes?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Some disputes don\\u2019t work well with mediation because the parties involved are not able to resolve their own issues. Mediation is not a process for people who are unable to make decisions for themselves. It\\u2019s also not appropriate for people who are unable or unwilling to be honest and authentic with one another. In mediation, the parties involved are expected to be honest and authentic with one another, which may be difficult or impossible for people who are unable to do that. Some people are not able or willing to overcome their own emotional issues or biases to be open, honest, and authentic with others. In mediation, parties are expected to share information with one another that they have not previously shared.

Since the mediator does not make decisions for the parties involved, mediation may not be helpful if one or both parties require a decision from the other party as a prerequisite for participating in the process. If one or both parties are not able or willing to be open, honest, and authentic with one another, mediation may not work.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Future of Mediation\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The future of mediation looks bright. More and more people are recognizing the benefits of mediation over litigation and are demanding that their dispute resolution process include mediation. Many organizations are now offering mediation services. While mediation is effective for many disputes, it does not work for all of them. Mediation is not a one-size-fits-all technique. Different techniques may be more or less appropriate for different types of disputes. The key is to find the technique that is most appropriate for the dispute at hand.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
