summary: The technology is still unproven, and therefore its risks are largely
  unquantifiable. Businesses that use blockchain may find that the technology
  doesn’t meet their needs. This is particularly true for large and established
  businesses that have significant budgets and are risk averse. There are
  currently several different types of blockchain that are in use, such as
  public, permissioned, and private blockchains. Each one of these has their own
  particular use cases and limitations. It is difficult to justify the risk of
  using the technology as it is still in its infancy.

## Blockchain is still in its infancy

The first thing to understand is that blockchain is still in its infancy and is undergoing significant development and evolution. This is important because it means that businesses need to be aware that the technology is still unproven, and therefore its risks are largely unquantifiable.
For example, businesses that use blockchain may find that the technology doesn’t meet their needs. If blockchain isn’t appropriate for your business and you don’t have the flexibility to change course, you could suffer significant losses.
This is particularly true for large and established businesses that have significant budgets and are risk averse. While blockchain is still in its infancy and there’s a lot of hype around it, it’s difficult to justify the risk of using the technology.

## Blockchain is hard to understand and use

As we mentioned above, blockchain is still evolving. This means that there are significant usability issues that will need to be resolved before it’s ready for primetime.
For example, there are currently several different types of blockchain that are in use, such as public, permissioned, and private blockchains. Each one of these has their own particular use cases and limitations. Figuring out which type is best for your business and how to use it can be a significant challenge.
Furthermore, blockchain networks are typically built using open-source software. This means that the code is freely available, but that it also lacks the stability and security that comes with commercially-built software.
Comparatively, traditional software is extremely well understood and has been used in businesses across the world for decades. It has the inherent stability and security that blockchain lacks, making it a less risky option.

## A solid business process isn’t always in place

Many businesses are excited about the promise of blockchain, but don’t understand the limitations of blockchain technology. As a result, they want to jump in and implement blockchain in any situation where it doesn’t make sense. This can lead to significant problems as blockchains aren’t a magic bullet for all problems.
For example, if your business process is faulty, no type of technology will be able to fix it. In fact, it will likely make the problem worse.
For blockchain to be successful, your company needs to have a solid business process in place. This means that all employees understand their roles and the expected workflow.
If there are significant issues with your business process, blockchain won’t be able to resolve them. It will simply exacerbate the problem by creating a system that is even more cumbersome than before.

## Blockchain is a conduit for cybercrime

Another significant risk of blockchain technology is that it is a conduit for cybercrime. This isn’t to say that other technologies don’t also pose a risk. However, as blockchain is relatively new and has a significant level of hype behind it, it is a prime target for cybercriminals.
Indeed, cybercrime has been a problem with cryptocurrencies since they were first developed. The high-profile hacks of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange and Coincheck exchange are just two examples of high-profile blockchain hacks in recent years.
Once again, this isn’t to say that other types of technology don’t have cybercrime issues, but it is something that businesses need to be aware of and take into consideration when making decisions about blockchain.

## Consumer data may be unreliable

In the blockchain, transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger. While this is great for ensuring that businesses are trustworthy and that money isn’t being stolen, it also means that all of the details of the transactions are public. This could mean that sensitive personal data, such as credit card numbers, could be compromised if malicious actors were able to get access to this information.
Indeed, there are currently several decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that are being built on blockchain technology where users will be able to trade cryptocurrencies with each other. This means that there is an inherent risk that someone will be able to access sensitive information.

## Bottom line

Overall, blockchain is an exciting technology that is poised to see significant growth in the coming years. However, it isn’t without its challenges, and businesses need to be aware of the potential risks that are associated with the technology. If you are considering implementing blockchain in your company, it’s important to fully understand the technology and associated risks.
