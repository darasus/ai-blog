  "summary": "Meditation is the act of sitting down with the goal of focusing on one thing only – your breath. The goal is to silence the mind and get it off the constant thinking so you can relax and bring your stress levels down. There are different types of meditation, but they all have the same goal – to bring you peace and calmness inside. There’s no right or wrong way of doing it – you can sit on the floor, in a chair or even lie down if that’�s more comfortable for you.",
