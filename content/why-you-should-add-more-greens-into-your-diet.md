summary: Vegetables are naturally healthy, but many people aren’t consuming
  enough of them. A diet rich in vegetables can lower your risk of obesity,
  heart disease, and certain cancers. A serving of broccoli contains about six
  grams of protein, which is about 10 percent of the recommended daily allowance
  (RDA) for protein. Adding protein to your meal is an easy way to increase the
  amount of protein you’re consuming. Mixing green vegetables with other healthy
  foods is a good way to get more greens into your diet.
intro: "Greens are packed with nutrients and fiber, but we don’t usually think
  of them as being super-healthy. Other foods like kale, spinach, and lettuce
  are often relegated to side dishes or salad toppings, not main courses.
  However, greens are some of the most nutritious foods you can eat. They’re
  high in vitamins K, A, and C as well as iron, potassium, calcium, and
  beta-carotene; they also have an abundance of antioxidants. In addition to all
  this nutrition, greens are also low in calories: one cup only has about 20
  calories. Here are some ways to make your greens even healthier — without
  sacrificing taste!"

## Add more vegetables to your diet

Vegetables are naturally healthy, but many people aren’t consuming enough of them. A diet rich in vegetables can lower your risk of obesity, heart disease, and certain cancers. Vegetables are high in fiber, which is important because fiber has been shown to lower cholesterol levels. Fiber can also help people lose weight by making people feel fuller, so they’re less likely to overeat.

Vegetables also contain vitamins and minerals that are important for a healthy body. For example, broccoli is high in vitamin C, which the body needs to maintain healthy bones and prevent certain types of skin diseases. And green vegetables like broccoli, lettuce, and spinach contain vitamin K, which can prevent bone fractures in older people.

## Add a protein source

Aside from being delicious, broccoli is an excellent source of protein. A serving of broccoli contains about six grams of protein, which is about 10 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein. Adding protein to your meal is an easy way to increase the amount of protein you’re consuming. Pairing a vegetable like broccoli with a protein source like chicken provides a complete protein. This means that the meal contains all the essential amino acids that your body needs but can’t produce on its own.

If you’re eating broccoli as a side dish, you can still add a little protein by sprinkling some toasted nuts or seeds on top. Buckwheat, quinoa, or millet are also great grain choices to add to a broccoli salad. And if you really want to kick the protein up a notch, add some cheese or other dairy product to your broccoli.

## Spice it up

Green vegetables are delicious and nutritious, but they can also be a little bit bland. Adding spices, or even a little bit of salt, can help liven them up. Chili peppers and spices like cumin and turmeric, in particular, are great for balancing out the bitter taste of broccoli.

But spices also contain health benefits, too. Turmeric, for example, has been linked to having anti-inflammatory properties, which can help with chronic conditions like arthritis, joint pain, and digestive disorders like Crohn’s disease. Chili peppers also have health benefits, including helping to maintain a balanced blood sugar level.

## Try using different cooking methods

A lot of people eat their greens raw, but cooking certain kinds of greens can add a lot of flavor and texture that’s missing in a salad. Cooking broccoli, cauliflower, and other leafy greens can help to soften them, making them easier to eat.

If you’re trying to lose weight, you can also steam or boil your greens to reduce their calorie content by about 10 percent. You can also try roasting your greens in the oven. You might be surprised at how delicious they can be when they’re mixed with melted cheese or other flavor-enhancing ingredients.

## Mix it with other healthy foods

There are a lot of ways you can work green vegetables into your diet by themselves, but you can also mix them with other healthy foods. There are endless possibilities for ways to mix vegetables with other foods. Good combinations include broccoli with pasta, spinach with eggs, and lettuce with chicken. A good way to get more vegetables into your diet is to make vegetables the star of the meal. Instead of pasta with a meat sauce, try making pasta with vegetables.

## By adding greens powder

Greens powders are a quick and easy way to add a lot of greens to your diet. There are several brands of greens powders available. They’re a concentrated source of greens and other vegetables such as broccoli and spinach. You can add a spoonful to anything, including water or juice, to get a lot of nutrients in a small amount of food.

Greens powders are a convenient way to get the vitamins and minerals that you’d otherwise be missing out on if you’re not eating enough vegetables. And since they’re concentrated, they’re a good source of natural energy.

## Conclusion

Greens are an excellent source of nutrients and vitamins that your body needs, but they can be tough to get in your daily diet otherwise. There are lots of ways to get more greens into your diet, though. You can start by eating more vegetables, adding a protein source to your meal, and trying new ways to prepare your greens. And if you’re having trouble getting enough greens in your diet, try adding a greens powder to your diet to boost your daily intake.
