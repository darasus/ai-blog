There are no heroes in this period\\u2014just two paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a stark world where there are no easy answers.\nThe 1980s was a peak moment in that tension\\u2014from Reagan\\u2019s \\u201Cevil empire\\u201D speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe. In brief: It was not a good time to be alive if you believed in world peace. Thankfully, Hollywood had spies as intrepid as Tom Hanks ready to leap into action against those dastardly Soviet Commies whenever they needed someone captured or rescued from behind enemy lines.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The book was first published as a serial in an American magazine and then as a book. In fact, it is not an understatement to say that it became one of the most popular books in the United Sates at that time.\nThe Great Depression started in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasted until 1939. This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings. Although fictional, Steinbeck creates characters that are very much human with their fears, hopes and desires \\u2013 struggling against a harsh world that is indifferent to their plights.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s a pleasant listen but might not be what you expect if you only know them from their first two albums. The band took a left turn creatively, covering topics like technology, isolation and death rather than dancing around in your bedroom to this record.\nChvrses has gained more popularity among a different group of fans by releasing this album than they ever did with their first two releases combined. This is partially because they have expanded their audience by collaborating on songs with Haim and Bleachers recently as well as making this change in sound so now they have crossover appeal to radio listeners too!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
