It\\u2019s about an astronaut called Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars after his crewmates think he\\u2019s dead and leave without him. This might seem as just another case of annoying Hollywood over-simplification: after all, we get so many bioengineered super-geniuses with computer uplink implants that they can become trapped in remote locations via their own stupidity. But there\\u2019s more to it than that.\nIn both book and film, the humanity of Watney comes out in everything he does to survive: logical thinking (how can I eat this potato again?), ingenuity (I need water; how do I distill it from our CO2 filters), courage (explore the abandoned outpost), and compassion (contact my family). He also has a lot of fun with his predicament, cracking jokes through his video log and even going disco.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Instead, it gets a free ride from the gravity of the Earth. As the Earth rotates, this gravity pulls the ship off in the direction of the east. If the ship travels fast enough, it can get beyond the Earth\\u2019s orbit. If the ship has enough velocity to overcome the Earth\\u2019s gravity, it will go into a heliocentric orbit. If it travels around the sun and gets far enough away from the Earth, it can then be captured by the gravity of Mars. Once captured by Mars, it will travel in an elliptical orbit around the planet.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why staying on Mars is a terrible idea\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The Martian surface is an extreme environment: the temperature fluctuates wildly, the CO2 in the air is unbreathable, the UV is intense, and there\\u2019s no water.

Astronauts have tried wearing oxygen masks, but they could only survive on the surface for 30 minutes or less. If Watney is breathing oxygen from a tank, he will have to be very careful where he goes and what he does \\u2013 especially with his CO2 filters. He can only get away with these devices because of the low gravity and low CO2 content in the Martian atmosphere.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The sunlight is too dim\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The sunlight on Mars is about 38% as strong as it is on Earth. This is barely enough for plants to synthesize food via photosynthesis. And it\\u2019s not enough to power the solar panels that Watney uses to charge his batteries and run his communications equipment.
