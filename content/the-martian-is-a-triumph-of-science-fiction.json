He\\u2019s also worked with some pretty big names (including one we\\u2019ll get to shortly). Now, he\\u2019s back with another new album, titled \\u201CVoicenotes.\\u201D It\\u2019s a solid effort that shows growth and maturity, as well as keeping Puth\\u2019s fun and lighthearted style.\nAt its core, Voicenotes is an acoustic pop album. However, it goes deeper than just putting electric guitars aside; these songs are stripped right down to the bare bones. There\\u2019s still plenty of production value\\u2014especially on the third track\\u2014but it feels like Puth made a conscious decision not to hide behind anything.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
