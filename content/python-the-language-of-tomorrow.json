  "summary": "Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn and is used in many industries. Python is a very flexible programming language that means that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what you want it to do. Because Python is used to write code for many industries, it means that there are many different job opportunities for you when you graduate. Python developers love to hire Python developers when they need to hire someone new. It has great potential to work in finance, healthcare, technology, education, and science.",

You know that there are many different programming languages out there and that they can be used for different things, but which one is the best one to learn first? Well, you might be surprised to learn that it\\u2019s Python. Why? Because it\\u2019s the language of tomorrow.\nNow you might be thinking: Why does that make it the language of tomorrow? After all, shouldn\\u2019t we be focusing on learning languages like COBOL that will help us in our future career as an accountant or something like that? Well\\u2026 perhaps. But maybe not so much. See, while those other programming languages are great for some things, they aren\\u2019t so great for others. And when we take a look at what other programming languages won\\u2019t be able to do in the future because of their limitations (or maybe just their age), we see why programmers today are saying that Python is going to be the dominant language of tomorrow. Let\\u2019s dive into why by taking a look at several reasons why Python is a fantastic first programming language to learn today!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But the truth is, programming can be tough and many people who try to learn how to code give up because it\\u2019s too hard to understand. You see, the most important thing to look for in a programming language if you are just getting started is that it needs to be easy to learn. If it isn\\u2019t, you risk getting frustrated and quitting before you even get started.\nBut luckily for Python beginners, Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn. In fact, it\\u2019s been used in many high school and college classrooms for ages as the go-to language for people learning to code for the first time because it makes the concepts of programming easy to grasp for beginners.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"It\\u2019s Used In Many Industries\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the best things about Python is that it\\u2019s used in many industries. Why is this important? Well, if you were to learn a programming language like C or C++, you would only be able to use it to write code for certain industries. For example, if you wanted to get a job as a C++ developer, you could only work in the gaming industry. But if you learn Python, you can use it to write code for many different industries like: Finance, healthcare, technology, education, and science.\nBecause Python is used to write code for many industries, it means that there are many different job opportunities for you when you graduate. You might be thinking: If it\\u2019s used for so many industries, why isn\\u2019t it being used for more industries?

But there is another reason why hiring managers love to hire Python developers when they need to hire someone new. The reason is because Python is a very flexible programming language. What that means is that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what you want it to do.\nThis means that you can use the same code in your project to do many different things. For example, let\\u2019s say you are working on a project that uses a website interface to order food to be delivered to your home. You can use the same code you write to do that in your project to then write code to program a self-driving car. It`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
