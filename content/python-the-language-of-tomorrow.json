Python is a very flexible programming language that means that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what you want it to do.

Indeed, it seems as though the market is oversaturated with them.\nBut Go stands apart from all other programming languages because of its simplicity and ease-of-use. It has been adopted by some of the biggest technology firms in the world \\u2013 Google, Digital Ocean, Intuit, Wordpress.com and Heroku \\u2013 for its ease of use, simple syntax and fast performance.\nEven though it\\u2019s one of the newer programming languages around today, Go is steadily growing in popularity among developers and businesses.
