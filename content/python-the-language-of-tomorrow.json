Python is a very flexible programming language that means that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what you want it to do. Because Python is used to write code for many industries, it means that there are many different job opportunities for you when you graduate.

Depending on what type of database you want to create and your specific needs, there is likely an ideal programming language for you.\nThe Go programming language is one option that is worth exploring if you are looking for a great general-purpose programming language but one with special focus on database programming.
