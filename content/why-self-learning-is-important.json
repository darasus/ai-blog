Or perhaps you recall the pressure of being tested and your fear of failing that test. Either way, learning is something that you do at school or work with an instructor monitoring your progress. Self-learning is a different way to get knowledge and skills by putting in the time and effort to research, practice and perfect the material on your own. It involves reading books or online tutorials, practicing skills, watching videos and listening to lectures all by yourself.\nSelf-learning has many advantages over traditional learning methods because it means far more responsibility for your own advancement.

It gives you flexibility in where and when you study, so it fits with your schedule and other commitments. You also have more control over what you learn and how fast you progress. The result is greater confidence in your abilities and an increased ability to tackle challenges.

It involves finding ways to learn more about yourself so that you may improve as a person, understand your strengths and weaknesses, recognize your beliefs, values and goals in life, be constantly aware of what triggers you the most so you can handle those situations better the next time, understand your fears so that you can tackle them head on instead of avoiding them all your life, etc.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
