However, this is only one small part of what it means to work as a scientist \\u2014 and even that part isn\\u2019t exclusive to professionals.\nWhether you want to work in research, education, industry or another science-related field, self-learning can help you reach your goals. It gives you flexibility in where and when you study, so it fits with your schedule and other commitments. You also have more control over what you learn and how fast you progress. The result is greater confidence in your abilities and an increased ability to tackle challenges. Read on for details about why self-learning might be right for you and some examples of how it could be useful if you work as a scientist.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

In fact, it is an ongoing, never-ending process. It is a way of thinking, an approach to learning and a set of strategies that can be used at any point in time. Self-learning is basically learning how to learn, so that we can continue to grow even after finishing school or university.\nEven adults prefer different methods of learning such as reading books on their own instead of listening to lectures or attending group classes. There are numerous ways through which you can tap into your inherent abilities and cater to your specific needs as an adult learner.
