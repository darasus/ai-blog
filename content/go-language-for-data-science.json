  "summary": "Go is an open source programming language that was designed by Google engineers in 2009. It aims to solve the problems of large software projects, such as code maintenance and scalability, that developers faced when working in other languages. Goâ€™s high-level standard libraries, designed for general-purpose programming, are easy to understand and follow standardized conventions. Go has a static type system with no explicit types, making the language less error-prone. Go also has a very fast compilation time, making it a good choice when you need to deploy code often.",

If you want your team to be able to respond immediately and pivot smoothly, you need them to use the same toolkit, share libraries and work on one codebase as much as possible. There are so many different tools for data science, from Python libraries like pandas and NumPy to the Scala programming language for statistical analysis.\nIf your team consists of engineers who are also experienced data scientists, then you can choose any solution that fits both requirements. However, if you have data scientists who are not programmers or engineers who need to get up-to-speed fast, it\\u2019s best to choose a solution that offers multiple benefits at once. Go is an increasingly popular solution that combines the ease of scripting languages with the performance of compiled languages. In this article, we will learn about why you should use Go as a data science language and what its main benefits are.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
