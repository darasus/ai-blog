It was originally developed at Google to solve some of the problems with other programming languages like C and Python that made it difficult to write programs that are fast, small, and correct.\nGo makes it easy to capture the programmer\\u2019s intent in code and generate output directly from source - thanks to its lightweight syntax, concise statement, and built-in support for anonymous functions without the need for temporary variables or auxiliary arguments.\nGo is generally regarded as a modern programming language, which means that it has been designed with performance in mind, comes with support for concurrency, and implements new features introduced by other recent programming languages like Rust and Swift. The factors listed above make Go an excellent choice for software development projects involving medium-to-large sized codebases, performance optimization, or writing compilers.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

You will have to face challenges and difficulties in your work almost every day. In order to overcome these challenges, you need to consistently find ways to improve your coding efficiency and speed.\nWorking efficiently as a software engineer is challenging for most people. Most developers have so many different things on their minds at any given time that it can be hard to keep track of everything simultaneously. As a result, most coders perform slowly because they are thinking too much about what they\\u2019re doing rather than just doing it. However, with practice and dedication, you can learn how to code faster.\nBelow, we will walk you through some tips that will help you become more productive with your coding and accelerate your workflow significantly.
