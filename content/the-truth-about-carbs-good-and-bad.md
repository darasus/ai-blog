summary: Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients essential for human
  life. They’re found in starchy foods like bread, pasta, rice and potatoes. The
  difference between good carbs and bad carbs lies in their chemical
  composition. Good carbs are usually processed and refined, stripped of their
  natural nutrients. Bad carbs are often associated with obesity, type 2
  diabetes and heart disease, as well as bad breath and dental problems. The
  best sources of carbohydrates are fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains,
  legumes, and nuts and seeds.
intro: >-
  High-carb foods such as pasta, potatoes and bread have long had a bad
  reputation for making you fat. That’s because carbohydrates are a source of
  sugars known as “simple carbs” (also called digestible or digestible natural
  sugars). These simple carbs are quickly broken down by the body and raise your
  blood sugar level quickly. 

  If you consume more than 20g of carbohydrate per day, that’s considered high intake. High intake of carbohydrates can lead to an excess production of glycogen in the liver, which is converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue, particularly around the belly. Once these fats reach dangerous levels they trigger the production of stress hormones like cortisol which has been linked to insulin resistance, high cholesterol, obesity and fatty liver disease. 

  However, not all carbs are bad for you – in fact some types are essential for good health. Here’s how to tell the difference...

## Good carbs vs bad carbs

Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients essential for human life, along with protein and fat. They’re found in starchy foods like bread, pasta, rice and potatoes, as well as certain fruits and vegetables. Carbohydrates can also be artificially manufactured and added to processed foods, such as sweets and soft drinks.
The difference between good carbs and bad carbs lies in their chemical composition. In nature, carbohydrates are made up of sugars that are naturally contained in the plants we eat. These are called “complex carbs” or “dietary fibers.”
Bad carbs are usually processed and refined, and stripped of their natural nutrients. These include foods like white bread, pasta, white rice, sugar and soda. They are “simple carbs,” which are easily digested and quickly raise blood sugar levels.
Bad carbs are often used as a quick energy source, but due to their high-glycemic index (GI), they can quickly be turned into fat by your liver and stored in your fat cells.
Bad carbs are often associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as bad breath and dental problems. 
## Why you should eat more carbs

When you consume more carbohydrates, your insulin levels rise and your fat-storing mechanisms are suppressed. This means you’ll have an easier time burning off excess fat, particularly around your midsection.
A high-carb diet has also been linked to a lower risk of depression, improved cognitive function, and lower risk of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer.
A high-carb diet has also been linked to a lower risk of depression, improved cognitive function, and lower risk of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer.

A low-carb diet, on the other hand, is associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as several other serious health risks. 

## Quality matters when it comes to carb intake

Not all carbs are created equal. The best sources of carbohydrates are fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts and seeds. These whole foods are rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, and should be a staple in any healthy diet.
A diet rich in whole-food carbs has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, and may reduce your risk of diseases like heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.
A high-carb diet rich in these “good carbs,” particularly fibre-rich whole grains, has also been linked to lower levels of depression.

## Bottom line: The key is to be mindful of portion sizes

There’s no doubt that a high-carb diet can have positive health benefits, but the key is to be mindful of portion sizes.
A healthy diet should consist of around 50% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 20% fat. However, this will vary depending on your age and activity level.
A person who is very physically active will require more carbohydrates than someone who is sedentary. The same goes for younger people, compared to an older person who has less muscle mass and will require less calories overall.

A healthy diet rich in complex carbohydrates has many health benefits, but it’s important to keep it in moderation. Not only is a low-carb diet bad for you, but it’s also nearly impossible to maintain in the long run.

## How to enjoy carbs without the guilt

You can still enjoy carbs without piling on the pounds.

If you want to enjoy more carbs, make sure you’re eating whole foods that are rich in fibre and nutrients. These include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts and seeds. These foods contain complex carbohydrates, which are broken down more slowly by the body and don’t cause that spike in blood sugar that bad carbs do.

If you want to lose weight, Atkins and other low-carb diets might seem like the way to go. However, these diets can be very difficult to maintain and often result in a serious lack of nutrients.

## Expert Advice ~~~

As we’ve discussed, not all carbs are bad for you, and neither are all low-carb diets. The key is to be mindful of portion sizes and include a variety of whole foods in your diet.

One study found that a low-carb diet rich in whole foods was just as effective as a low-fat diet in improving blood cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of heart disease.

So, if you’re trying to lose weight or improve your health, don’t be afraid to add more carbs to your diet. Just make sure they’re whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.

Keep in mind that if you have certain health conditions, like diabetes or heart disease, you should talk to your doctor before you make any drastic changes to your diet.
