Carbs are one of the most essential nutrients our bodies need to function properly. They’re the main source of energy for our cells, and they help us to absorb and store other important nutrients. But not all carbs are created equal. There are good carbs and bad carbs, and it’s important to know the difference.

Good carbs are typically high in fiber and low in sugar. They’re slowly digested and absorbed, so they don’t cause spikes in blood sugar levels. Good carbs include whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.

Bad carbs are typically high in sugar and low in fiber. They’re quickly digested and absorbed, so they can cause spikes in blood sugar levels. Bad carbs include white bread, white rice, pastries, and sugary drinks.

The bottom line is that we need carbs for energy, but we should focus on eating more good carbs than bad carbs.
