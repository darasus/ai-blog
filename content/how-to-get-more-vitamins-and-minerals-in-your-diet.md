## What are vitamins?

Vitamins are essential nutrients that our bodies need in small amounts for everyday processes. We can only get vitamins from the foods we eat because our bodies can’t make them. Most people associate vitamins with a healthy diet, but they are actually essential nutrients that are crucial for your health. The human body is complex and includes systems that are delicate and require careful upkeep. Vitamins are essential for the body to function properly and to maintain a healthy balance. They are necessary for many processes, such as the production of hormones, tissues, muscles, and the way our cells grow and divide. They also boost the immune system and fight off infections and diseases. In fact, a healthy and balanced diet is the best way to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs to stay healthy and strong.

## What are minerals?

Minerals are inorganic substances that our bodies need in small amounts for everyday processes. We can get minerals from food, water, supplements, and the soil. They help our bodies function properly and maintain a healthy balance by regulating fluids, electrolytes, and pH levels. They also help the body create hormones and enzymes, regulate blood pressure and body temperature, and promote nerve and muscle function. Some of the most important minerals our bodies need include calcium, copper, iron, iodine, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc.

## Why do we need vitamins and minerals?

Vitamins and minerals are crucial for all aspects of health. For example, vitamin C helps the body fight off infections, iron is essential for healthy blood, and magnesium helps with energy and blood pressure regulation. We need vitamins and minerals every day to stay healthy, but there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to daily intake recommendations. Everyone’s needs are different depending on factors like age, health, and gender. It’s also important to keep in mind that we can easily get too much of some vitamins and minerals, which can lead to toxicity and other health problems. It’s best to get your vitamins and minerals from food as much as possible because synthetic vitamins can be harmful if taken in large doses.

## How much should we be getting each day?

Roughly, the recommended daily intake of vitamins and minerals is as follows:

Calcium: 1000mg

Iron: 15mg

Folate: 400mg

Vitamin A: 800 IU

Vitamin B6: 2mg

Vitamin B12: 6mg

Vitamin C: 90mg

Vitamin D: 600 IU

Vitamin E: 15 IU

Zinc: 10mg

Magnesium: 400mg

Potassium: 4700mg

Selenium: 55mg

While these daily intake recommendations are a good starting point, it’s important to tailor vitamin and mineral intake to your individual needs. This is particularly important for seniors and people with special health needs like breastfeeding women. And don’t forget to consider your daily intake of calories when you’re calculating the amount of vitamins and minerals you need.

## Which foods have the most vitamins and minerals?

You can find vitamins and minerals in a wide variety of foods, but some have a lot more than others. When it comes to vitamins and minerals, the best source is fresh fruits and vegetables. Whole grains and legumes are also great sources. Some of the highest-ranking foods when it comes to vitamins and minerals include:

Healthy eating can be challenging, but it’s worth it for your health and well-being.
