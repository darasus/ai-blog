summary: A meatless Monday is a day without meat and/or animal products. Eating

  People who follow a meatless diet may reduce their risk of developing heart

intro: >-
  Millennials and Gen Zers have been driving the demand for plant-based
  foods. More consumers today are adopting a lifestyle that focuses on balanced
  and healthy diets instead of restrictive fad diets. 

  In response to these changing preferences, businesses everywhere have started offering more vegetarian options. In fact, even fast food chains like McDonald’s and Burger King have started adding meatless items to their menus in an effort to cater to this growing market segment. And with good reason. Millennials alone account for nearly one-third of the workforce — a massive presence that will only continue to grow in coming years.

  This rise in popularity of meatless Mondays is not surprising given how many people now choose to eat less meat, fish, or any animal products on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays. 

  If you’re looking for ways to reduce your red meat intake without sacrificing taste or variety in your diet, consider instituting Meatless Mondays at your place of business as well as at home.

## Benefits of having a Meatless Monday

## How to have a successful Meatless Monday?

Before you decide to implement Meatless Mondays in your office or company, you must first understand the various challenges of this initiative.

Managing employee expectations - Ensure that your employees understand that this is not a vegan or vegetarian movement, but rather a dietary choice that anyone can make on Mondays. Also, be sure to let them know that you are not trying to force anyone to do anything. It’s simply an opportunity for people to reduce their meat intake if they so choose.

Managing guest expectations - Ensure that your guests understand that there may be a few meatless options available, but that the restaurant will continue to offer the full menu.

Providing menu options - While you’ll continue to offer your full menu, you’ll also want to provide your employees with a few meatless menu items as well. Be sure to provide a couple of options for each meal type (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).
