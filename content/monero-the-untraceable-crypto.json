We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups.
