intro: >-
  Contemporary internet-connected devices are complex networked systems
  with challenging security requirements. New IoT attack vectors and risks arise
  from the convergence of digital, social, mobile, cloud, sensor, and other new
  Internet services. 

  Security is a top concern for device manufacturers and users alike. Many consumers have reservations about the safety of IoT devices and services due to past experiences with computer viruses, spyware, insecure Wi-Fi connections, breach of personal information from databases and other incidents caused by unsecured systems. Security must be addressed from the beginning of each product lifecycle. Each phase requires an appropriate set of security measures to protect data against theft or sabotage as well as insider threats such as malicious insiders or rogue employees with privileged access. A comprehensive security program should cover several key areas including:

## Development Practices

Developers must follow secure coding practices such as input validation, output encoding and boundary testing. Additionally, access control and authentication methods must be implemented at the application level to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the devices.

Ongoing security testing and vulnerability scans are critical for identifying and addressing any issues that arise during development. Test and staging environments should have real-time monitoring and auditing to identify and address issues before production.

Device manufacturers can also take advantage of open source components to reduce development costs and accelerate time to market. However, security should be a key part of the selection process and due diligence should be conducted to ensure that open source components are secure, legally acceptable, and compatible with other system components.

## Device updating and patching

Embedded devices may not be able to be updated, and in some cases, the manufacturer may no longer support the device. In these cases, communication with the vendor to determine the risks and the feasibility of patching is important. While major vendors will provide patches for critical issues, it may take time for the patches to be released.

Devices with an internet connection should be able to download updates from the vendor’s servers. This allows manufacturers to regularly push updates to address newly discovered flaws or patch known vulnerabilities.

The following list highlights some of the vulnerabilities that are commonly found in IoT devices:

- Authentication / authorization Weaknesses : Lacking robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to devices or data could allow an attacker to tamper with devices or access and steal sensitive data.

- Code injection flaws : Compromised devices can be used as a launching point for attacks against other devices or data storage systems.

- Data transmission eavesdropping : Weak encryption algorithms or poor implementation of TLS / HTTPS could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on network traffic and steal sensitive data.

- Insecure cloud storage : IoT devices often store data in the cloud. Cloud providers should use strong security practices and regularly patch vulnerabilities. Cloud providers should also have a public and verifiable security posture.

- Insecure software updates : Devices should regularly download software updates from the vendor’s servers to address newly discovered flaws or patch known vulnerabilities. If updates are not automatic or there is no way to download updates from a secure server, the device could remain unsecured and vulnerable to attack.

## Network isolation and segmentation

Device manufacturers should segment networks and devices to prevent the spread of malicious code or hacker attacks from one device to another. The internet protocol (IP) address of IoT devices should not be in the same IP range as the server hosting the cloud service. Network segmentation can also help protect sensitive data by keeping IoT devices separated from other data systems.

## User authentication and access control

IoT devices often collect and store sensitive data such as health information and financial data. As a result, it’s critical that access to these devices be restricted to authorized users and that the data be properly encrypted and secured.

Authentication mechanisms such as two-factor authentication (e.g. using a mobile application or a one-time password (OTP) sent via an email) can also be leveraged to provide additional security. Password policies can be used to limit password types, length, and reuse.

Password managers can be used to store and manage passwords across various devices, thereby increasing the overall security posture of the system.

## Data storage and data protection

The data collected by IoT devices should be encrypted to protect against eavesdropping and tampering. Encryption should be deployed at the device level, not just at the network level. Data should be stored in a secure data center that is regularly audited by a third-party security auditor. The security posture of the data center should include physical security, network security, and operational security.

## Conclusion

Security is a top concern for device manufacturers and users alike. Many consumers have reservations about the safety of IoT devices and services due to past experiences with computer viruses, spyware, insecure Wi-Fi connections, breach of personal information from databases, and other incidents caused by unsecured systems.

A comprehensive security program should cover several key areas including development practices, device updating and patching, network isolation and segmentation, user authentication and access control, data storage and data protection, and other core security components.
