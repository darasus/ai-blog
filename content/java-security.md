Java security is a term used to refer to the various measures taken to ensure the safety of Java-based applications. These measures can be divided into two main categories: static measures and dynamic measures. Static measures are those that are taken during the development process, while dynamic measures are those that are taken at runtime.

Static measures include things such as code reviews, code audits, and static analysis tools. Dynamic measures include things such as runtime analysis tools, application firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

The most important thing to remember about Java security is that it is an ongoing process. There is no single silver bullet that will make your applications secure. Instead, it is important to take a layered approach, using multiple static and dynamic measures to ensure the safety of your applications.
