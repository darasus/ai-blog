  "title": "Go Language For System Administration",
  "summary": "Go is a compiled language, which is great for large-scale systems, and portable for distributed systems. It has a flexible type system that makes it easier to write and maintain code. The language’s strict type system forces you to write efficient code. Go has built-in support for unit testing thanks to the go test command, which runs a single test and fails if it fails. System administrators don’t just write code; they also write documentation, create config files, and automate tasks.",
  "intro": "It’s no secret that programmers love programming. But not all of them love similar things. Those who are drawn to computer science for its logic and problem-solving challenges might find coding a drag at times, especially if their work is mostly about wrangling with APIs or other standard software components.\nWe have probably all come across developers who don’t share our passions — those who get caught up in the glamour of the job title instead of its substance. And this kind of people is also drawn to different fields within our profession. For example, some programmers like writing code that controls machines or processes — in short, system administration tasks— rather than creating user interfaces or artificial intelligence algorithms.\nThat’s why we’ll be exploring Go as an excellent language for system administration (or any highly task-oriented role).",
  "content": "## Why Go?\n\nFor starters, it’s a compiled language, which is great for large-scale systems. It’s also portable, which is great for distributed systems. And it’s supported on all major operating systems, which is great for remote system administration.\nThere are lots of other great reasons for choosing Go for system administration. Like the fact that it has a flexible type system that makes it easier to write and maintain code. Or the fact that it has great support for concurrency, which makes it a natural choice for multi-core machines.\nAnd let’s not forget that Go is a relatively new language (it was released in 2009), which means it can be expected to evolve and mature over the next few years.\n\n## Go Is Incredibly Easy To Learn\n\nGiven the diversity of programming languages out there, it’s hard to find one that’s not only suitable for your specific tasks, but also easy enough to learn. Most of the time, it’s not the difficulty of the language that makes it hard to learn—it’s the barrier to entry imposed by the vast range of tutorials, books, and other materials.\nIn the case of Go, the barrier to entry is low enough that you can often find experienced system administrators who learned the language on their own. This is thanks to the fact that Go’s syntax is simple and easy to understand, and most online tutorials use real-world examples that you can relate to.\n\n## Go Is Blazingly Fast\n\nWhile many programming languages encourage developers to write clean code, Go actually forces you to write efficient code. The language’s strict type system is designed to make it impossible to write certain kinds of code, like type conversions that consume unnecessary CPU cycles.\nThis forces you to think about your code in a different way, which can be frustrating at first, but pays off in the long run. Go’s strict type system allows you to write code that’s faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain.\nThe fact that Go’s compiler performs static analysis means it can catch errors that other languages can’t. This makes it easier to maintain code as it grows—you don’t have to worry as much about hidden bugs or other issues.\n\n## Go Has Great Support For Networking\n\nIf you want to create distributed systems, or even just maintain remote servers, you need a language that’s flexible enough to deal with different types of networks. Like most modern languages, Go has a built-in network package for working with TCP-based networks. But it also has support for other network types, including Unix sockets, memory-based networks, and more.\nThis is helpful not just for distributed systems, but for any application that needs to communicate with remote machines, or talk to multiple processes that might be running locally.\nYou can also use Go to create APIs, which is helpful for system administration tasks that involve managing third-party integrations.\n\n## Go Has Great Support For Testing\n\nSystem administrators don’t just write code; they also write documentation, create config files, and automate tasks—all of which is best done with unit tests.\nGo has built-in support for unit testing thanks to the go test command, which runs a single test and fails if it fails. With this, you can be sure that changes to your code don’t break existing functionality.\nWith the help of Go’s built-in testing packages, you can also test your code while it’s running. This is useful not just for testing functionality, but also for finding bugs or other issues that only appear in production.\nThis is important because it allows you to focus on your code’s functionality, rather than its side effects. Whereas if you’re manually testing your code, you have to consider what it does to the rest of the system.\n\n## Go’s Importance In System Administration\n\nSystem administrators do a lot of things, but one of the most important is keeping track of their servers. This means monitoring things like memory, CPU usage, disk space, and network bandwidth. Fortunately, Go has support for a wide range of metrics and monitoring systems, including third-party services like Datadog and New Relic.\nThis is especially important when it comes to distributed systems. Distributed metrics give you insight into how your system is behaving, and help you understand and troubleshoot issues before they affect your users.\nWith distributed metrics, you can track the performance of every server within a distributed system, using a single dashboard. This allows you to spot bottlenecks, latency issues, and other problems before they affect your end users.\n\n## Summing Up\n\nSystem administration is a diverse profession that requires a diverse skill set. It is not just about installing and configuring software, but also about deploying and securing networks, managing databases, and even optimizing server performance.\nThis is why choosing the right programming language is important—it can make or break a system administrator’s career.\nGo is an excellent choice for system administrators. It has a flexible type system, is blazingly fast, and has great support for testing and distributed metrics. You can also use it to create distributed systems, and it’s supported on all major operating systems.\nThis is why we recommend that all system administrators learn Go. It’s an excellent language for any role, and especially system administration."
