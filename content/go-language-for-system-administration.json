Or the fact that it has great support for concurrency, which makes it a natural choice for multi-core machines.\nAnd let\\u2019s not forget that Go is a relatively new language (it was released in 2009), which means it can be expected to evolve and mature over the next few years.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go Is Incredibly Easy To Learn\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Given the diversity of programming languages out there, it\\u2019s hard to find one that\\u2019s not only suitable for your specific tasks, but also easy enough to learn. Most of the time, it\\u2019s not the difficulty of the language that makes it hard to learn\\u2014it\\u2019s the barrier to entry imposed by the vast range of tutorials, books, and other materials.\nIn the case of Go, the barrier to entry is low enough that you can often find experienced system administrators who learned the language on their own.

Go\\u2019s strict type system allows you to write code that\\u2019s faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain.\nThe fact that Go\\u2019s compiler performs static analysis means it can catch errors that other languages can\\u2019t.

Distributed metrics give you insight into how your system is behaving, and help you understand and troubleshoot issues before they affect your users.\nWith distributed metrics, you can track the performance of every server within a distributed system, using a single dashboard.
