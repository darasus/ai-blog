Millions of people around the world play video games every day, and some even make it their career. In 2018 alone, over 200 new video games were released. It\\u2019s important to keep tabs on all the new releases so you don\\u2019t miss out on anything great. That being said, there are a lot of video games that aren\\u2019t receiving the attention they deserve for various reasons.\nDid you know that the average video game player is getting older? According to recent data, the average age of video gamers is now 35 years old! That means most gaming enthusiasts probably won\\u2019t find as many underrated games as they would have when they were younger. However, there are still plenty of underrated gems out there that are well worth checking out this year! Here are the top 5 underrated video games of 2018:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It was a year that saw game developers pushed by streaming services like Twitch and YouTube continue to experiment with new ideas and designs while also returning to their roots with older properties.\nThat being said, not all games are created equal. There are excellent games and then there are... others less so.
