However, it\\u2019s usually either the most awkward party of the year (if you are single) or an excuse to get trashed and make out with someone in a magic hat (if you are coupled-up).\nIf you\\u2019re looking for something more than just that \\u2013 but also want to avoid playing another Frozen drinking game \\u2013 here are some great board games that will allow you and your friends to get in the festive spirit.\nWhether you have a small group or intend on playing with many more guests, there are plenty of games that will be enjoyable even with a large group of players. These board games all make excellent party games and can be played by anyone regardless of age or skill level.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
