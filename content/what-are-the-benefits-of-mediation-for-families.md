summary: Mediation offers an alternative to a court battle and often results in
  an agreement that is more fair and equitable than what might be ordered by a
  judge. Mediation can help preserve the relationship between the spouses as
  they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions.
  Mediation is often cheaper than litigation because there is no legal bill for
  depositions, court reporter fees, or other litigation expenses. It's important
  for divorcing couples to realize that a settlement on these issues is not a
  punishment for one spouse or an award to the other.
intro: >-
  Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process. It’s a way of
  resolving disputes that is less adversarial than litigation and usually
  cheaper, faster, and more private than other methods. Mediation is also
  collaborative as well as neutral. The mediator acts as a neutral party who
  helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable
  manner.

  In mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It’s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It’s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.

## What Are The Implications Of Filing For Divorce?

Filing for divorce is a black and white situation in which one party is clearly right and the other party is clearly wrong. Divorce has a negative connotation because it is associated with the dissolution of a relationship, which is something that is naturally filled with lots of love, hopes, and dreams for the future. It’s a sad and unfortunate situation that usually has no winners in it. When a couple files for divorce, they are ending their relationship. Even though one or both of the spouses may have wanted the divorce and initiated it, they are still very much affected by the emotions and feelings that are associated with ending a relationship, especially if there are children involved. The issues surrounding filing for divorce are far from black and white. There are often multiple sides to each issue that have been debated and discussed by the spouses for months or even years before they decide to file for divorce.

## Why Is Mediation A Good Choice?

Mediation offers an alternative to a court battle and often results in an agreement that is more fair and equitable than what might be ordered by a judge. Mediation often leads to quicker settlements than litigation. Because the mediator’s role is to help the parties find common ground, mediation can lead to settlements that please both sides. In court, one side often wins and the other loses. In mediation, both sides walk away feeling like they have gained something. Mediation is often cheaper than litigation because there is no legal bill for depositions, court reporter fees, or other litigation expenses. Mediation is also more private than litigation. There is a public record of court proceedings, but mediation sessions are confidential. 

## Mediation Can Help Preserve Relationships

Most divorces are not just about dividing property and debts and arranging child custody and visitation. Such legal action is often the last resort in a long process that has gone on for months or even years as the couple struggles to agree on issues concerning their children, finances, and other aspects of their relationship. Mediation may help preserve the relationship between the spouses as they try to settle their differences by reaching mutually agreeable solutions. Mediation encourages spouses to be open-minded and flexible. It encourages them to seek solutions that are fair and equitable to both of them rather than fighting for what they want regardless of the cost to their spouse.

## Mediation Can Help Settle Child Custody And Child Support Issues

Issues concerning the children are often the most difficult for divorcing couples to resolve. However, if the spouses can agree on issues such as who will be the primary residential parent and what financial contribution each parent will make toward the children’s expenses, they can greatly simplify the rest of their divorce. If they reach agreement on these issues during mediation, they can often complete the rest of their divorce in a few weeks rather than many months.

## Mediation Can Help Settle Property Division Issues

Issues concerning property division often lead to difficult and emotion-filled discussions between divorcing spouses. It’s important for divorcing couples to realize that a settlement on these issues is not a punishment for one spouse or an award to the other. It’s simply a way of dividing the couple’s property in a fair and equitable manner so that both spouses leave the marriage with similar economic positions.

## Mediation Can Help Settle Other Issues

Issues such as spousal support (alimony), child support, payment of debts such as mortgages and car loans, payment of attorneys’ fees, and payment of other costs related to the divorce can all be included in the issues that are settled by the spouses during mediation.
