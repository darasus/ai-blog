In the battle of wills that is feeding your child healthy food, parents are often the losers. Kids have an uncanny ability to detect weakness and exploit it mercilessly, using their cuteness as a weapon of mass destruction until they get what they want.\nHowever, being a parent also gives you some advantages. You know your kid better than anyone else \\u2013 probably even better than they know themselves \\u2013 and you won\\u2019t hesitate to use that knowledge to get them eating veggies once and for all.\nWhether they\\u2019re old enough to understand or not, children need to understand that green leaves are not just something funny that vines climb on.
