  "intro": "Raising kids can be tough, especially when it comes to feeding them right.  In the battle of wills that is feeding your child healthy food, parents are often the losers. Kids have an uncanny ability to detect weakness and exploit it mercilessly, using their cuteness as a weapon of mass destruction until they get what they want.\nHowever, being a parent also gives you some advantages. You know your kid better than anyone else – probably even better than they know themselves – and you won’t hesitate to use that knowledge to get them eating veggies once and for all. \nWhether they’re old enough to understand or not, children need to understand that green leaves are not just something funny that vines climb on. They’re also packed with vitamins and minerals which will keep your little one healthy if they eat more of them. Here are some tips on how you can do exactly that...",
  "content": "## Find The Right Veggies\n\nWhen you’re trying to get your kids to eat more vegetables, you might feel like you’ve got two options – either they eat nothing at all or they eat everything in the produce section.\nYou don’t have to give up on veggies completely if your child doesn’t like them – but you shouldn’t push it either.\n\nSome veggies are just easier for kids to accept than others. Even though all veggies are nutritious, some are more nutritious than others.\n\nBroccoli and cauliflower are good examples of this. They’re both healthy – but broccoli is even better for you.\n\nBut broccoli is also a bit of a pain to eat for a small child. It’s not easy to chew, and it’s even harder to swallow. Cauliflower, on the other hand, is much easier to eat. It’s softer and has a much milder flavour.\n\n## Start With Baby Steps\n\nYou can’t expect your child to go from eating nothing but pizza to eating a salad with croutons every night. You’ll just end up frustrated and they’ll end up hungry.\n\nIt’s important to start with baby steps and work your way up. You might want to start with smoothies or fruit snacks that combine some veggies with some fruit. That way, the kids get a bit of everything they need in one go.\n\nYou can also try hiding vegetables in other foods. It might sound sneaky, but it’s a great way to get your kids to start including more vegetables in their diet.\n\nIf you have them on your side, you’ll have made a great start to getting them eating better. Once they’ve got used to eating veggies, they’ll be able to start weeding out the ones they don’t like. At that point, you can encourage them to try new things.\n\n## Sneak It In\n\nAs we’ve said, you shouldn’t try to sneak all the veggies into everything, but it can be a good way to start.\nWhile you can’t just put broccoli in everything, you can add spices and herbs which have a similar effect.\n\nCinnamon, for example, is great for regulating blood sugar levels. It’s also a fantastic antioxidant. If you add cinnamon to your kid’s food, they won’t even know that they’re eating something good for them.\n\nIf you want to add a vegetable to something and make it barely noticeable, try adding spinach or avocado. They’re both very mild and will barely change the flavour of the food you’re adding them to.\n\n## Don't Forget Dessert\n\nIf your kid doesn’t like vegetables, they’re probably not getting a lot of the vitamins and minerals they need.\nIf they’re sick often, or are just feeling really tired at the end of the day, there’s a chance they’re vitamin deficient. If you don’t do something about it, it could lead to bigger problems down the road.\nIf you’re having trouble getting your kid to eat vegetables, don’t forget dessert.\nDark chocolate has lots of antioxidants and will help boost your child’s immune system if you add it to their daily diet.\nBlueberries are another great choice. They’re packed with vitamins and are a delicious dessert that’s easy to sneak into just about anything.\n\n## Try New Foods Together\n\nIf you’re trying to get your kids to eat more veggies, you need to try new things.\nIt’s easy to fall into a rut with dinner and keep eating the same things over and over again. If you do that with veggies, your child is going to get bored and stop eating them. If you want them to keep eating their greens, you need to try a few new things.\nStart with something simple and move up from there.\nIf your child has never eaten a pumpkin before, you don’t want to try baking a pie, but you can make a simple pumpkin soup or stew. They’ll get used to the taste and feel adventurous at the same time.\n\n## Take A Break\n\nKids can be fickle, and they often go through phases where they just don’t want to eat.\nIf your child just isn’t interested in eating vegetables, there’s no point in forcing them.\nIf you force them, they’ll just push them away and resent you for it.\nInstead, take a break and try again later.\nSometimes kids just need to take a break from eating vegetables until they’re ready to come back to them again.\nIf you keep trying to get your kid to eat veggies, it’ll only push them away until they’re completely done with eating anything that isn’t pizza.\nGive them time and you might find that they’re ready to try vegetables again.\n\n## Summing Up\n\nKids are fickle and they don’t always want to eat what’s good for them. If you want them to start getting more vegetables in their diet, though, you need to start working on it early and be patient.\nIf you’re patient, your child will learn to love vegetables and will be grateful for you later on. If they don’t start eating more vegetables when they’re little, though, they might end up having some health issues later on in life.\nIf your child isn’t eating vegetables, don’t worry. You can help them start eating more vegetables in no time by trying different things. Just be patient and keep trying and your child will be eating their greens in no time."
