summary: The best way to make sure you get the most of it is to plan your meals
  for the week and go with root vegetables. Root vegetables contain lots of
  vitamins and minerals, but don’t have as much fiber as leafy greens do. You
  can use root vegetables in soups, stews, and even desserts. Preserve the fresh
  produce you have now and use it to preserve it in winter. Use leftovers to mix
  up your leftovers by incorporating seasonal produce with seasonal produce.
intro: >-
  When you’re eating seasonally, you can take advantage of peak local
  produce to make the most of it and reduce food waste. However, it can also
  feel like a challenge at times: when there’s nothing in your CSA box but
  potatoes for the third week in a row or another arctic blast has come and gone
  without leaving behind any winter squash… What are you supposed to do?

  And truth be told, there are some downsides involved with eating seasonally. For example, it might feel more expensive to buy vegetables only when they’re in season; that may not always be the case, but often the non-seasonal price is lower because they are grown more efficiently with fewer inputs on an industrial scale. 

  However, there are plenty of upsides too! Eating seasonally means that you get to enjoy different flavors throughout the year — which is something many people don’t tend to do.

## Plan your meals for the week.

Before you start browsing recipes to make sure you use up all your veggies, take a few minutes to make a plan for what you’ll cook this week. Do you want to try out a new recipe every day or is there a dish you’d like to master? Maybe you want to use up your leftovers — those are always great opportunities to incorporate seasonal produce!

## Go with root vegetables.

Root vegetables are great in winter, but they can be enjoyed all year round. You can use them in soups, stews, and even desserts! Some good options are carrots, beets, celeriac, fennel, parsnips, potatoes, radishes, rutabaga, and turnips. Potatoes are especially versatile; you can boil, mash, roast, or French fry them.

Root vegetables contain lots of vitamins and minerals, but don’t have as much fiber as leafy greens do. They can also be pretty high in carbs, so keep that in mind if you’re watching your diet.

## Cook up a big batch of grains & beans.

This is a great option if you’re not a big fan of root vegetables; after all, they don’t really taste like anything other than, well, root vegetables! You can try out different recipes and pairings with grains, beans, and legumes.
What’s great about grains and beans is that they’re very cheap, can be bought in bulk, and make a ton of food. They’re also a good source of fiber, protein, and vitamins and minerals.

## Use up canned goods.

Canned goods are very useful in the wintertime, because you can make stews, soups, and casseroles with them. They also usually come in BPA-free cans, so even though they’re not as healthy or good for the environment as fresh produce, they’re definitely better than nothing.
Canned tomatoes, beans, and corn, for example, are good staples to have on hand. If you don’t have any canned goods in your pantry, you can also make a meal out of canned vegetables — like beans, corn, and tomatoes.

## Preserve the fresh produce you have now.

You can save a few veggies by preserving them. For example, you can freeze broccoli, cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower, you can pickle cucumbers and peppers, and you can turn apples, pears, and tomatoes into jam. You can also make your own kimchi, pickles, or fermented vegetables.

If you live in a warm climate, you can make your own water-simmered citric fruits like oranges, lemons, or limes. You can also make your own jam, sauce, and chutney, which you can use in winter when your fresh produce is limited.

## Get creative with leftovers!

Leftovers are awesome, but they can also get boring. Make sure to keep them exciting by putting a creative twist on them. You can try out different recipes and then portion them out to have them for several days in a row.

You can also make sure to mix up your leftovers by incorporating seasonal produce. For example, you can make a quesadilla with tortillas, nacho cheese, and some cooked veggies — or make a stir-fry with seasonal produce, rice, and leftover meat. You can also make lasagna with seasonal produce and pasta or pizza slices with seasonal produce and bread.

## What to do with all that cabbage?

Cabbage is a quintessential seasonal food — but what to do with it when there’s too much of it? You can make kimchi with it, you can make sauerkraut with it, and you can make coleslaw with it.
Cabbage can also be used in soups, stews, and casseroles, or you can fry or roast it. You can use it to make a creamed dish, a pie, or a quiche. You can also use it to make quick and easy desserts — like cabbage pancakes, cabbage cookies, or cabbage cake.

## Summary

As you can see, there are lots of ways to take advantage of seasonal produce. The best way to make sure you get the most out of it is to plan your meals for the week and go with root vegetables. You can use grains and beans to bulk up meals, and you can preserve the fresh produce that’s in season right now. Finally, you can get creative with leftovers, and you can use up all that cabbage!
