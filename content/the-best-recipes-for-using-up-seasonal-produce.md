## Prepare your pantry and fridge

The key to using up seasonal produce is having the right equipment and ingredients on hand to put out creative new dishes. Because you’re likely to find yourself with more produce than you know what to do with, it’s important to be prepared.

Be sure to check the health of your baking supplies. If you bake often, you probably have baking supplies like baking sheets, measuring cups, and spatulas that are in need of a refresh. If these things are starting to look less than clean or are experiencing wear and tear, it’s time to give them a good scrubbing or replace them altogether.

It’s also a good idea to make sure you have a well-stocked pantry. You can never have too many beans, but you can definitely have too little flour. If you don’t already have a systematic and well-managed pantry, now is a great time to start.

## Invest in good storage containers

If you’re lucky enough to have a CSA box, you’ll notice that, while the produce may be awesome, the containers they come in are often not. They’re usually cheap, thin plastic bags that can tear or break easily, leaving your potatoes and carrots sprawled out on the floor.
Most produce will last longest in a container made of paper or cardboard that can breathe. So before you dive in and start transferring veggies, make sure you have a few good paper or cardboard boxes on hand.

When it comes to how long you should keep produce of different types, most vegetables and herbs will keep in your fridge (or outside in a cool, shady place) for a couple of weeks. But there are a few notable exceptions that you should be aware of. Tomatoes, bell peppers, and potatoes are good examples of longer-lasting produce. Lettuce, on the other hand, is highly perishable, so think about eating it sooner rather than later.

## Grow your own sprouts

Sprouts are incredibly easy to grow yourself, and they make for an excellent addition to any meal. You can toss them into a salad, sandwich, or wrap, or use them as the stars of any meal, like in a crunchy and colorful sprout bowl.

All you need are seeds, water, and a little patience. Any kind of seed will work, but look for varieties that are cheap, easy to find, and require little-to-no prep beforehand. Some great options include alfalfa, radish, clover, lentils, and mung beans.

To start your sprout garden, all you need is a container with holes in the bottom, a paper towel, seeds, and some water. Simply put the seeds and paper towel in the container, add water, and put the whole thing in a warm place.

In a few days, they should be ready to eat. Depending on the variety, a single batch of sprouts will last anywhere from a few days and a few weeks. If you notice that they are growing mold, throw them out immediately.

## Cook up a big pot of grains

Most people have rice in their pantry, but it’s easy to forget about other grains like quinoa, barley, and millet. These are some of the easiest ingredients to add to a meal, making them a great solution for boredom and a great option for feeding a group.
When it comes to cooking grains, the rule of thumb is two parts water for every one part grain. So, for every cup of grain you want to prepare, you’ll need two cups of water.

A good way to use up a bunch of grains is to double the recipe and store half in the fridge for later. This way you can quickly throw together a simple meal or snack in no time.

## Don’t be afraid to buy in bulk

Many people avoid buying in bulk because they’re worried they won’t be able to use up all of their produce before it goes bad. This is a valid concern, but it’s important to remember that “bulk” doesn’t mean “inexpensive.”
You can find wholesale produce wholesalers where you can buy produce in bulk and then re-sell it at a profit. You can also look for wholesale produce markets in your area where you can buy fruits and veggies in bulk directly from the growers.

In these scenarios, your produce will be priced according to the volume you buy, not just the weight. This makes it more cost-effective to buy larger amounts of produce that might not last as long but would otherwise be more expensive if bought in smaller portions.

## Don’t forget about root vegetables

Root vegetables like carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and turnips may not be at the top of your list, but they’re a great way to use up a bunch of produce and add variety to your meals.
Baking, roasting, or even simply boiling these veggies is a great way to make sure they don’t go to waste. They’re also fantastic for throwing into salads or simply mashing and serving up as is.

Sweet potatoes are a particularly good option for using up a lot of produce since you can use them in so many different ways. Simply peel the skin, cut them up, and roast them in the oven with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and you have a delicious side dish that goes with just about everything.

## Bottom line

Using up your seasonal produce can feel like a daunting task, but with the right preparation and approach, it’s not as hard as it might seem.

First, make sure your kitchen is stocked with the essentials and you have plenty of space to store your produce. Next, create a plan that allows you to use all your produce while also keeping it fresh. Finally, put your plan into action and enjoy delicious and fresh meals all season long.
