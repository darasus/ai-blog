  "summary": "The choice of language for your cloud application must be carefully considered. Certain languages might be a better fit for certain types of applications, but you should always choose the language that best solves your business problem. There are several factors to consider when evaluating languages for use in the cloud. These include the ability of the language to handle sudden increases in demand for your application as well as issues with availability. The cost of development, training, maintenance, and support can also be considered. The speed and performance of a language can be measured by the speed of your application and overall performance.",

In fact, IDC estimates that worldwide public cloud services will grow from $206 billion in revenue in 2017 to $345 billion by 2021. New types of cloud services are also emerging every day.\nA majority of organizations now use cloud services as part of their IT strategy. From handling peak demand to reducing costs and improving availability, cloud-based services have proven their worth for many businesses. Even so, making the move can be challenging for IT professionals and software developers.
