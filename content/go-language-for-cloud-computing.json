There are so many programming languages available in the market that it might seem confusing for programmers to select the one that best suits their needs and also caters to future needs.\nProgramming is not as simple as it seems, especially when you consider all the different aspects involved with it. It is not just about learning code, but also understanding which types of projects you want to take up and what kind of structure your career will take from here on. So when choosing a programming language, there are certain aspects you need to keep in mind before making your final decision.
