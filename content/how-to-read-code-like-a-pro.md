When it comes to reading code, there are a few things you can do to make sure you understand it like a pro. First, take the time to read through the code line by line. This will help you get a better understanding of what the code is doing and how it works. If you come across something you don't understand, don't be afraid to ask for help from someone who does.

Another great way to understand code is to run it through a debugger. This will help you see what the code is doing step by step and can be very helpful in understanding how it works. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment with the code. If you change something and it doesn't work, you can always revert back to the original code. By experimenting, you'll learn more about how the code works and what you can do with it.
