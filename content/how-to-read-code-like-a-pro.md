summary: The first thing you want to do when reading code is open up the
  declaration and read the code like you’re reading a book. The declaration
  section contains all the information you need to know about how the code is
  written and what it actually does. If you see a line of code that has a lot of
  abbreviations, acronyms, or words you aren’t familiar with, try to read it as
  though you were reading a sentence in English. Keep track of the terms that
  you see most often while reading code by keeping a dictionary beside you.
intro: >-
  The way you understand code today will determine the speed with which you
  can read and comprehend code tomorrow. After all, no one is born a coding
  expert; that designation is something you must earn by constantly challenging
  yourself to improve your skills. However, reading and understanding code isn’t
  always easy, especially when it’s written in a foreign language or has certain
  nuances that are beyond your current understanding. 

  Reading code like an expert means more than just knowing what words mean and their general significance. It also means being able to dive deeper into the syntax of how those words are put together so that you can understand what they mean in context and intention. Read on to discover some tips for reading code like a pro!

## Don’t Be Disappointed By What You See

When you open up a file and find a bunch of lines of code that seem to make no sense whatsoever, remember that you’re reading the code from the inside out. When a programmer writes a piece of code, they’re writing it for themselves first and foremost. They’re using their own shorthand and abbreviations to keep things tidy and easy to understand for themselves. This is especially true in languages like JavaScript that are more forgiving than other programming languages. Code that looks like absolute gibberish up front is often a sign that the programmer has been keeping things tidy for themselves. It’s also a sign that you need to keep reading to understand what’s happening.

## Read the Declaration (The Header)

The first thing you want to do when reading code is open up the declaration and read the code like you’re reading a book. The declaration section will typically contain all the information you need to know about how the code is written and what it actually does. It’s the equivalent of reading the “about” or “summary” section of a book. If there’s something you don’t understand, you can be sure it will be explained in this first section. It’s often where you’ll be able to find the name of the programmer who wrote the code, what language it was written in, and a general overview of what the code is intended to do. While you’re reading the declaration, be sure to keep an eye out for words that you don’t understand. If there’s a word you don’t know, be sure to look it up and write it down. This will help you remember what each word means and how it’s being used in the code.

## Don’t Be Scared of Vocab

One of the biggest things that can trip up a beginner coder trying to read code is getting scared of certain words or terms. If you see a line of code that has a lot of abbreviations, acronyms, or words you aren’t familiar with, don’t shy away from it. Instead, try to read that line of code as though you were reading a sentence in English. Break it down into its components and try to understand what each part means. You’ll often find that the scary, mysterious lines of code are actually tame when you break them down. They’re just words that convey a slightly different meaning than the words you’re used to.

## Don’t Be Shy About Skimming

We’re all busy, and sometimes you just can’t sit down and read a file from start to finish. If that’s the case, don’t feel bad about skimming the file for the information you need. If you know you’ll need to understand a function or module, don’t feel bad about just reading the parts of the code that pertain to that function. Especially when you’re first starting out, it’s normal to just want to know the things that directly relate to your work. Reading the entire file isn’t always necessary, and you shouldn’t feel bad about skimming if you don’t have the time to read it in its entirety.

## Keep Track of Key Words

Coding languages are often full of abbreviations and acronyms, so you’ll definitely want to keep track of the terms that you see most often while reading code. You can do this by keeping a dictionary of code terms or abbreviations beside you while you’re reading. This will help you remember what each word means so that you don’t have to keep flipping back to the dictionary every few seconds. It will also make it much easier for you to understand what each line of code is doing.

Keeping track of the most common words in your language of choice will make it much easier for you to understand what’s happening in other people’s code. It’s never fun to be reading someone else’s code and not understand what it’s doing. This is particularly true if you’re a beginner coder and you’re trying to understand code written by an expert. Keeping a dictionary by your side will help you avoid that issue and will allow you to read the code as easily as if it was written for you.

## Read the Code

Once you’ve gotten through the declaration and you’ve understood the abbreviations and terms being used, you can actually read the code. However, this doesn’t mean reading the code from top to bottom. Instead, you should be reading the code from the inside out.

When you read from the inside out, you’re reading the code as a whole instead of reading each line in sequence. This will help you understand the entire flow and purpose of the code so that you can better understand how it works. This is particularly important when reading code written by an expert. When you read the code from the inside out, you can see everything that’s happening in one fell swoop. This will help you understand what the code is doing as a whole, as well as where each line of code fits into the overall picture.

## Take Breaks and Help Your Brain

While reading code can be overwhelming and difficult at times, it’s important not to give up. If you’re feeling like you’re just not getting it, take a break and come back to the code later when you’re feeling fresh. It’s also important to remember that you’re not expected to read and understand code perfectly on the first try. Even if you’re reading code that was written by an expert, don’t expect to understand it perfectly the first time you read it. Instead, approach reading code with a patient and humble attitude. You’re not expected to understand everything immediately, but you are expected to try your best and keep trying until you understand.
