This is primarily due to the rise of social media and the prevalence of user-generated content. As a result, there are now a plethora of video editing apps that allow users to add filters to their videos, create green-screen effects, and more. Given this opportunity, businesses in this space have begun to thrive. However, for all of its current successes and future potential, the video processing industry could be even more successful with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIf you\\u2019re currently looking for opportunities in video processing or AI and want to learn about some specific Go programming examples that can be used in this industry, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we\\u2019ll go over exactly what the video processing industry is and why it needs AI. Additionally, we\\u2019ll explore some common applications of Go for AI and video processing as well as provide examples of programs written in Go that can be used by you if you want to get started sooner rather than later!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
