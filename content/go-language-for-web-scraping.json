Do you want to expose your child to STEM-related fields without sacrificing their creativity and imagination? If so, coding might be the perfect opportunity for both of you.\nCoding is an excellent skill to introduce your child to at an early age. It challenges them creatively and forces them to think critically. Additionally, it opens up a multitude of potential career opportunities in some of the fastest-growing fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.\nCoding falls within the scope of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) because it involves working with codes or sets of instructions that computers can read and understand.\nIf you\\u2019re ready to learn more about how coding can help your kid grow as a person and as a future adult\\u2014as well as why it\\u2019s important for kids\\u2014read on!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

They demand that it must be fast, secure, and scalable to support current and future users. They also need deployment to be convenient, efficient, and fully automated.\nWith all of the modern application development tools and frameworks available today, deploying Java applications should be straightforward. Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don\\u2019t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

From handling peak demand to reducing costs and improving availability, cloud-based services have proven their worth for many businesses. Even so, making the move can be challenging for IT professionals and software developers.
