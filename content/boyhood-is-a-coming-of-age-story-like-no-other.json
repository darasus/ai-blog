This resulted in about 15 million people losing their jobs and having no income or access to food or shelter. It also led to bankruptcy for many farmers as crop prices fell significantly. As a result, many people had no choice but to leave their homes, towns, and cities to look for work elsewhere.\nThis book describes this period through the Joad family \\u2013 impoverished tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced by circumstances to travel westward in search of new opportunities along with thousands of other displaced persons also seeking new beginnings.

It has proven to be a way for people from different cultures and backgrounds to come together and express themselves. From its humble beginnings in New York City, hip hop has grown into a worldwide sensation, with local scenes spawning in cities across the globe. This article explores the history of hip-hop music, from its roots as an underground movement in the early 1980s to its predominance as one of the most popular genres today.\nFans of rap music are undoubtedly aware that this style of music has origins in New York City during the 1970s and 1980s, but there is much more to know about how exactly it came about and how it evolved over time. From breakdancing to rapping, we\\u2019ll explore all of the elements that blended together to form what we now call \\u201Chip-hop\\u201D today.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Monsters, ghosts and psychotic killers are no longer frightening, so viewers instead get the same story with a different setting, characters and victim every time. The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days.

In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.
