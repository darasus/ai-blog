What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives.

However, the film doesn\\u2019t make the mistake of framing this moment as the most important event in Mason\\u2019s life. Instead, it allows the moment to be what it is: a painful but ultimately normal part of growing up.\nWhile the timing of the divorce is important, Mason\\u2019s feelings about the event are as well. He feels sad for his parents, but also relieved because he knows that he can\\u2019t control their decisions.

We see him move from a boy into a young man.\nThis is the heart of what it means to be a teenager: growing up too quickly and experiencing more emotions and bodily changes than you can handle. While the divorce does mark the moment when Mason becomes an adult, the film also captures the feeling of rushing through adolescence too quickly. Each moment captures a specific emotion or feeling that Mason experiences along the way, even if it precedes the divorce. The film is careful to not ignore the smaller moments of Mason\\u2019s life, even if they aren\\u2019t as significant as the divorce.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,'\"Boyhood\" is a coming-of-age story like no other.

It is a narrative that is careful not to frame any one event as the most important. It is a story that sometimes moves too fast and sometimes feels like it stops completely.

It is also a somewhat odd one, in that it has some dissonant notes which are not quite what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.\nA critical darling and an audience-pleaser on its original release, it was soon eclipsed by the #MeToo moment when a few unfortunate and probably inadvertent misogynistic undertones came to light.\nSince then, The Hateful Eight has been rediscovered as a fascinating film, almost certainly a deliberate commentary on the time we now view as its setting \\u2013 post-Civil War America, somewhere in the middle of Reconstruction, with simmering tensions between the North and South still unresolved. The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
