  "summary": "The narrative of \"Boyhood\" is unusual because it is told from the inside out. Instead of following a protagonist from birth to adulthood, viewers experience the ups and downs of Masonâ€™s life as a series of discrete moments. The movie follows Mason and his family exclusively, allowing for an extremely detailed look at the lives of a single family over a relatively long time period. The film is extremely detailed, allowing viewers to see the seemingly unimportant moments that add up to form a childhood.",

What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives.

We see Mason struggle with his parents\\u2019 divorce and the death of his grandfather. We see his sister grow up and his mother struggle with depression.

However, the film doesn\\u2019t make the mistake of framing this moment as the most important event in Mason\\u2019s life. Instead, it allows the moment to be what it is: a painful but ultimately normal part of growing up.\nWhile the timing of the divorce is important, Mason\\u2019s feelings about the event are as well. He feels sad for his parents, but also relieved because he knows that he can\\u2019t control their decisions.

We see him move from a boy into a young man.\nThis is the heart of what it means to be a teenager: growing up too quickly and experiencing more emotions and bodily changes than you can handle. While the divorce does mark the moment when Mason becomes an adult, the film also captures the feeling of rushing through adolescence too quickly. Each moment captures a specific emotion or feeling that Mason experiences along the way, even if it precedes the divorce.

It is a narrative that is careful not to frame any one event as the most important. It is a story that sometimes moves too fast and sometimes feels like it stops completely.
