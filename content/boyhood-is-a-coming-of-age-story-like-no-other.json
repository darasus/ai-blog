The album is a mix of upbeat pop tracks and slower ballads that showcase the sisters\\u2019 harmony and vocals. Even if you aren't a fan of pop music, it's worth giving this album a listen.\nThe trio had been working on this album for some time before releasing it. In September 2016, they released three singles; \\u201CRight Now,\\u201D \\u201CNew York Excuse\\u201D and \\u201CSentimentality.\\u201D\nAnd after a year-long hiatus following the release of these songs, HAIM announced via Instagram in June 2017 that they would finally be releasing their second studio album (and first extended play) later that year.\nLuckily for us, they stuck to their word and released the nine-track EP on Sept. 14, just in time for our listening pleasure. Here are some of our favorite tracks from HAIM's 'Something To Tell You' Album:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The Babadook is a fantastic example of how to shake things up again. Released in 2014 and limited to only a few theaters in its native Australia, this wonderfully creepy film went under the radar until it became an Internet sensation years later as one of the most original horror movies in recent memory.\nThe monster movie sub-genre is especially thin on fresh ideas these days.

In addition to those staples we\\u2019ve also seen zombie apocalypse stories (that often include some variation of vampirism), ghostly apparitions, hillbillies with cannibalistic tendencies, possessed dolls, insane asylum inmates and even extraterrestrial parasites that take over human hosts as their source of food on earth.\nWith all those elements combined into one production you have something like \\u201CThem\\u201D from 2013 or any number of other films where monsters are revealed to be aliens or humans who were exposed to some sort of virus that turned them into beasts.
