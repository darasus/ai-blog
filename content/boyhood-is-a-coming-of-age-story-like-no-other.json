The title track opens the record with a mock-operatic explosion of strings and piano that is as grandiose and sarcastic as anything this singer-songwriter has released to date. It\\u2019s as if Father John Misty (aka Josh Tillman) is speaking directly to us, the listener, right from the beginning: pure comedy indeed.\nIt\\u2019s a brilliant move on Tillman\\u2019s part to open an album with such a statement piece, because it sets the tone for what is to follow. Pure Comedy continues with a theatrical bombast that feels more inspired by Broadway than indie rock; there are even snippets of voiceover scattered throughout to help drive home Tillman\\u2019s point. But what exactly is his point? That human existence is absurd? Yes, that too. And also something about being terrified of artificial intelligence taking over the world (and rightfully so).\nThis might all sound like some heavy stuff for a Father John Misty record, but trust us \\u2013 it only gets heavier from here.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The plot itself is somewhat secondary to those elements; that\\u2019s why rather than summarise the plot of The Hateful Eight once more (if you want that, see my original review below), we\\u2019re going to focus instead on what makes this such an intriguing and unusual movie.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
