Instead, it allows the moment to be what it is: a painful but ultimately normal part of growing up.\nWhile the timing of the divorce is important, Mason\\u2019s feelings about the event are as well. He feels sad for his parents, but also relieved because he knows that he can\\u2019t control their decisions.

We see him move from a boy into a young man.\nThis is the heart of what it means to be a teenager: growing up too quickly and experiencing more emotions and bodily changes than you can handle. While the divorce does mark the moment when Mason becomes an adult, the film also captures the feeling of rushing through adolescence too quickly. Each moment captures a specific emotion or feeling that Mason experiences along the way, even if it precedes the divorce.

It is a narrative that is careful not to frame any one event as the most important. It is a story that sometimes moves too fast and sometimes feels like it stops completely.

Films like \\u201CSelma\\u201D are necessary to remind viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black residents. The town was also home to Selma\\u2019s most famous resident at the time: Collin W. Lewis, also known as \\u201Cthe Lion of Selma\\u201D \\u2013 a prominent civil rights leader who had grown up there after his family fled Greenwood as part of the Great Migration from 1916-1921. In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 \\u2013 known today as Bloody Sunday because those marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized (Voting Rights Timeline).\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is both an ecstatic celebration of this most challenging art form and a cautionary tale that is as much about breaking down our heroes as it is lifting them up on pedestals.\nAnd yet, Whiplash is neither of those things if you don't have ears to hear and eyes to see what director Damien Chazelle so expertly puts right in front of us.
