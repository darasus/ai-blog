  "title": "\"Boyhood\" is a coming-of-age story like no other",
  "summary": "The narrative of \"Boyhood\" is unusual because it is told from the inside out. Instead of following a protagonist from birth to adulthood, viewers experience the ups and downs of Mason’s life as a series of discrete moments. The movie follows Mason and his family exclusively, allowing for an extremely detailed look at the lives of a single family over a relatively long time period. The film is extremely detailed, allowing viewers to see the seemingly unimportant moments that add up to form a childhood.",
  "intro": "The coming-of-age trope is one of the most frequently used narrative devices in modern film. From \"Stand by Me\" to \"Superbad,\" there are countless stories about adolescents transitioning from innocent children into independent adults. However, it is almost unheard of for a film to capture the nuances and absurdities of growing up as effectively as Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood.” The movie documents 12 years in the life of Mason (played by Ellar Coltrane) and his family through a series of carefully crafted vignettes that document the everyday minutiae of life without being cliché or cloying.\nLike so many movies about kids growing up, \"Boyhood\" begins with young Mason being uprooted from his home in Texas and forced to migrate to new cities as he grows older. What makes this movie unique, however, is that all these major events occur over an 11-year period while Linklater was filming with the same actors at different points in their lives. The result is something like a documentary on human development — funny, sad, awkward, and everything in between — presented through the lens of an intimate cinematic experience.",
  "content": "## A coming-of-age story told from the inside out\n\nThe narrative of \"Boyhood\" is unusual because it is told from the inside out. Instead of following a protagonist from birth to adulthood, viewers experience the ups and downs of Mason’s life as a series of discrete moments. This allows viewers to see how small experiences add up over time, informing and shaping the person that Mason becomes. Furthermore, the movie follows Mason and his family exclusively, allowing for an extremely detailed look at the lives of a single family over a relatively long time period. This allows viewers to gain a greater understanding of how childhood experiences shape the formation of an individual from the inside out. On a larger scale, this also allows viewers to gain a greater understanding of how childhood experiences shape families as a whole through the formation of individual relationships.\n\n## The benefit of a long-form narrative\n\nThe benefit of a long-form narrative is that it allows viewers to gain a greater appreciation for the seemingly small events that add up to form the person they become. \"Boyhood\" allows viewers to see how small events — like being forced to move to a new school — can have a dramatic impact on one’s life. This can be compared to a standard narrative in which the protagonist’s change-of-school event would be a dramatic turning point, but in \"Boyhood,\" it is merely a fact in the timeline of Mason’s life. Longer narratives allow viewers to see how small events can contribute to forming the person they are, even if they don’t have an obvious impact. They allow the viewer to gain a greater appreciation for everyday life by providing them with a larger frame of reference.\n\n## An intimate snapshot of growing up\n\nOne of the most important qualities of \"Boyhood\" is its intimacy. This is due to a combination of factors, including the decade-long span of the narrative and its focus on a single family. The film is extremely detailed, allowing viewers to see the seemingly unimportant moments that add up to make up a childhood. In the same way, it is also very personal. We see Mason struggle with his parents’ divorce and the death of his grandfather. We see his sister grow up and his mother struggle with depression. It is this combination of factors that make \"Boyhood\" a truly intimate snapshot of growing up. It allows viewers to see how growing up is not just about big events, but also the seemingly unimportant moments that add up to form a childhood.\n\n## Sometimes it feels like time just stops\n\nThe most important moment in Mason’s childhood occurs when his parents decide to get a divorce. This is a major event for anyone, but it is also something that most viewers have experienced firsthand. However, the film doesn’t make the mistake of framing this moment as the most important event in Mason’s life. Instead, it allows the moment to be what it is: a painful but ultimately normal part of growing up.\nWhile the timing of the divorce is important, Mason’s feelings about the event are as well. He feels sad for his parents, but also relieved because he knows that he can’t control their decisions. When Mason expresses regret that he wasn’t a better son, we see how growing up doesn’t just involve experiencing the big events of life but also feeling the emotions that accompany those events.\n\n## Sometimes it moves too fast\n\nAgain, the divorce is a significant moment in Mason’s childhood, but the film doesn’t ignore the events that came before it. Throughout the film, we see Mason experience the awkwardness of going through puberty. We see him crush on girls and feel his confidence grow only to be dashed by rejection. We see him move from a boy into a young man.\nThis is the heart of what it means to be a teenager: growing up too quickly and experiencing more emotions and bodily changes than you can handle. While the divorce does mark the moment when Mason becomes an adult, the film also captures the feeling of rushing through adolescence too quickly. Each moment captures a specific emotion or feeling that Mason experiences along the way, even if it precedes the divorce. The film is careful to not ignore the smaller moments of Mason’s life, even if they aren’t as significant as the divorce.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\"Boyhood\" is a coming-of-age story like no other. It is an intimate snapshot of growing up through the everyday minutiae of life. It is told from the inside out, allowing viewers to see how small experiences add up to form the person they become. It is a long-form narrative that allows viewers to gain a greater appreciation for the seemingly small events that make up a childhood. It is a narrative that is careful not to frame any one event as the most important. It is a story that sometimes moves too fast and sometimes feels like it stops completely. In short, \"Boyhood\" is a coming-of-age movie that captures the absurdity and magic of growing up in a way that no other film has ever managed."
