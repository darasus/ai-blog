## What Causes Dogs To Bark Excessively?

There are many reasons why dogs bark, but one thing is certain – excessive barking can be annoying and stressful for both dogs and their owners. Fortunately, there are ways to train your dog not to bark so frequently and effectively. Read on to discover how you can curb your dog’s excessive barking quickly and easily!

Dogs will often bark when they sense danger or feel threatened in some way. This is a survival instinct that can be traced back to their wild roots when barking would alert other pack members to potential danger. Dogs will also bark when they lack stimulation and attention, so excessive barking can often be a sign that your dog needs more exercise and mental stimulation. An understimulated dog is more likely to become bored and anxious, which in turn can lead to excessive barking. Dogs will also bark when owners engage in excessive barking, so if you frequently bark at your dog, they might pick up on this behavior and begin barking excessively whenever they want something.

## Barking By Instinct

Dogs will often bark when they sense danger or feel threatened in some way. This is a survival instinct that can be traced back to their wild roots when barking would alert other pack members to potential danger. As domesticated dogs, barking is no longer necessary for survival, but it can still be very instinctive.

While you may want to train your dog not to bark when they sense danger, you should also try to understand why they are doing it. If your dog is barking at a passing car or neighbor, there is likely no malice or threat. They may just be barking at the noise and commotion.

Try to gently shush them back to silence, offering them reassurance and comfort if needed. If your dog barks excessively when there is no reason for it, you might want to consult with a veterinarian to determine if there is a medical condition that causes excessive barking.

## Excessive Barking Due To Boredom

Dogs will often bark when they lack stimulation and attention, so excessive barking can often be a sign that your dog needs more exercise and mental stimulation. An understimulated dog is more likely to become bored and anxious, which in turn can lead to excessive barking.

If you frequently leave your dog alone for long periods of time, they may become bored and begin barking excessively as a way to pass the time and relieve their anxiety. If you notice that your dog begins barking more when you leave them alone, you may want to start paying closer attention to their daily activities. Are they getting enough exercise? Do they have sufficient mental stimulation? You may need to adjust their schedule to ensure they have enough attention and stimulation while you’re away.

## Excessive Barking Due To Anxiety Or Fear

Dogs will often bark when they sense danger or feel threatened in some way. This is a survival instinct that can be traced back to their wild roots when barking would alert other pack members to potential danger. While you may want to train your dog not to bark when they sense danger, you should also try to understand why they are doing it. If your dog is barking at a passing car or neighbor, there is likely no malice or threat. They may just be barking at the noise and commotion.

If you notice that your dog barks excessively whenever they see someone they don’t know, are in unfamiliar surroundings, or hear loud noises, they may be experiencing anxiety. Dogs may also bark when they feel threatened, as a way to alert owners that they need help. If you notice that your dog barks excessively in certain situations and seems anxious, you may need to seek medical attention. Your veterinarian may be able to prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication to help calm your dog and curb excessive barking.

## Excessive Barking Due To Possession And Dominance

Dogs will often bark when they sense danger or feel threatened in some way. This is a survival instinct that can be traced back to their wild roots when barking would alert other pack members to potential danger. While you may want to train your dog not to bark when they sense danger, you should also try to understand why they are doing it. If your dog is barking at a passing car or neighbor, there is likely no malice or threat. They may just be barking at the noise and commotion.

If you notice that your dog barks excessively at other dogs while they are on a walk, they may be trying to mark their territory and establish themselves as dominant. This is particularly common in male dogs, and it’s best to seek help from a veterinarian before it escalates into a dangerous situation. Your veterinarian may be able to recommend a behavior specialist who can help you train your dog to stop barking due to possession.

## Tips For Curbing Excessive Dog Behavior

- Provide ample exercise and mental stimulation. When dogs are bored and have nothing to do, they are more likely to become anxious and begin barking excessively. Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to help curb excessive barking.
