The different factors that impact performance, and how you can measure them. In this article, we\\u2019ll go over the specific strategies for tuning your Java applications to get better performance. There are many moving parts in a Java virtual machine and a variety of things that can negatively impact performance.\nWe\\u2019ll discuss a few specific techniques and configurations you can use to tune your JVM for improved performance. This includes heap size, code caching, compiler options, code usage, and interpreter mode. Read on to learn more about these concepts and their implications on your application\\u2019s performance.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
