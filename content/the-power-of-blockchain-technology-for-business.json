This is because the processes of shipping and logistics have many touchpoints where trust is important. When one player in the supply chain breaks the rules, it can slow down the whole chain. This can result in manufactured goods being stuck in port or in warehouses, shortages at retailers, and late shipments of services. A blockchain-based solution can help companies manage their supply chain more effectively and create more transparency in the process. Many companies have already implemented blockchain technology to improve their supply chain. Danish shipping giant Maersk has partnered with IBM to use blockchain technology to manage their supply chain more effectively.

Blockchain technology can be used to create smart contracts, manage KYC (know your customer) data, or facilitate cross-border payments.
