A blockchain-based solution can help companies manage their supply chain more effectively and create more transparency in the process. Many companies have already implemented blockchain technology to improve their supply chain. Danish shipping giant Maersk has partnered with IBM to use blockchain technology to manage their supply chain more effectively.

Blockchain technology can be used to create smart contracts, manage KYC (know your customer) data, or facilitate cross-border payments.
