  "summary": "A leash is long enough to give you enough room to walk comfortably but short enough so that it doesn’t drag on the ground when you’re not holding it. A crate can be a great place for your dog to rest, especially when you're training them to walk on a leash. The best way to train your dog is to use a “heel” command to keep them closer to you and prevent them from becoming a nuisance around other people and dogs.",
