Mediation isn\\u2019t just for couples who are breaking up or divorcing; it can be useful in resolving disputes with co-workers, business partners, friends or family members.\nMediation is cost-effective and time-efficient, reducing the potential for long legal battles and the financial and emotional costs that go with them. In mediation, an impartial third party called a mediator meets separately with each person involved in the dispute. The mediator does not take sides but helps each person understand the other person\\u2019s point of view and find solutions they can agree on.\nAdditionally, mediation allows you to keep control over your situation by avoiding court and practically ending your dispute faster than going to trial. If you\\u2019re interested in learning more about this resolution process as a way to manage your own conflict or as an advisor if you are working with someone who needs help resolving their dispute, read on.

It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.
