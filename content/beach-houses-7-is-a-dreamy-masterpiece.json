  "summary": "Elizabeth sings about reminiscing about that special moment when it all began with lines like “Reminding you of something you forgot.” “Dark Spring” is the perfect blend of the Beach House we know and love and the change we saw on their last two albums. “Lemon Glow” carries some of the melodies from “Bloom”, Beach House’s first album released in 2008. The sixth track on the album is a beautiful love song that feels like the perfect end to the first half of the album.",

Not every song on the album is as brilliant as its title track (see below), but it all creates an intriguing listen as a whole.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Beach House, they're an indie rock duo from Baltimore, Maryland that have released six albums and numerous EPs since their debut in 2006. Their sound has evolved quite a bit over their last two records, 2015's \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and 2018's \"6\". Both experimental pop albums with heavy electronic influences.\nOn \"7\", they go back to the basics of guitar-driven songs with Elizabeth and Alexis playing almost all instruments themselves once again (with help from some friends). This gives us a fresh take on their usual dreamy sound - intimate, raw and personal.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This is track number one and the title track, a perfect introduction to Beach House\\u2019s take on dream pop on this record. It\\u2019s a song about the start of a relationship. Elizabeth sings about reminiscing about that special moment when it all began with lines like \\u201CReminding you of something you forgot.\\u201D \\u201CDark Spring\\u201D is the perfect blend of the Beach House we know and love and the change we saw on their last two albums.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The second track on the album is \\u201CDive.\\u201D This is the first single from the album released back in October of 2018. \\u201CDive\\u201D is one of the more upbeat songs on the album and one of the best as well. It\\u2019s a song about falling in love, with lyrics like \\u201CYou fell in love with the sound of the ocean.\\u201D This song is a great example of how this album is both nostalgic and fresh at the same time. Something Beach House do so well.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The third track on the album is the second single released, \\u201CLemon Glow\\u201D. This is one of the more electronic-sounding songs on the album and the first instance of Beach House\\u2019s trademark layered harmonies coming through. This is also the first hint of nostalgia that comes from this album, as \\u201CLemon Glow\\u201D carries some of the melodies from \\u201CBloom\\u201D, Beach House\\u2019s first album released in 2008.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The fourth track on the album is \\u201CSkipping\\u201D. This is another one of the more upbeat songs and a return to the Beach House we know and love. This song isn\\u2019t about falling in love like others on the album, it\\u2019s about staying in love.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The fifth track on the album is \\u201CGirl of the Year\\u201D. This is one of the more interesting choices of song order on the album. It\\u2019s one of the slower songs but it has a lot of energy. It\\u2019s about the anxiety of being in a relationship and feeling like you\\u2019re being held back by the girl you love.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The sixth track on the album is \\u201CDrinking Coffee\\u201D. This is a beautiful love song that feels like the perfect end to the first half of the album.

It\\u2019s a beautiful song with a catchy chorus, great guitar riffs and a simple yet effective drum beat.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The seventh track on the album is \\u201CLurking\\u201D.
