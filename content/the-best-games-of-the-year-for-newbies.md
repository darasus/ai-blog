summary: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the definitive version of the game that some
  people have been playing for over 25 years. Outlast 2 is a survival horror
  game about a journalist investigating an asylum for the criminally insane.
  Mario Kart is a game that you can play for hours and never get bored of. It’s
  easy to pick up and play, but it has enough depth that you don’t feel like
  you’ve mastered everything. You can play it for just a few minutes at a few
  hours at a time for all skill levels at a point-and-click adventure.
intro: >-
  Like any other hobby, gaming can have some intimidating barriers to
  entry. There’s a bewildering number of video games out there, and as with any
  entertainment medium it comes with its own jargon and slang. If you’re new to
  gaming, it can be hard to figure out where to start.

  This may not come as a surprise if you’ve read even a single article about the current state of the video game industry, but 2018 was a rough year for gamers — especially those who are just dipping their toes into this whole “video games” thing. Many big-name titles such as Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed were so filled with microtransactions and other unfair business practices that they were met with widespread criticism and even government intervention in some cases.

  We had so many great games this year that choosing our top 10 was incredibly difficult. But we managed it! Here are the best games for newbies in 2019:

## Sea of Thieves

This might seem like an odd choice for a list of the best games for newbies, but hear us out.
This charming multiplayer pirate adventure was created by Rare, the same team that brought the world Banjo-Kazooie, Conker’s Bad Fur Day, and GoldenEye 007. And Sea of Thieves is every bit as goofy and fun as those classics.
Sea of Thieves is all about teamwork and communication. Players are randomly assigned to one of three ships and asked to do their best Captain Sparrow impression. The goal is to track down and steal treasure from other players.
You’ll have to decide how to approach the task as a team. If you’re all above deck, you’re an easy target. If you’re all below, you might not be able to hear your fellow pirates. If you’re scattered across the ship, you won’t be able to work together to steer.

## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

Another Nintendo entry? We know, we know. We’re as surprised as you are.
But Mario Kart is so much more than a casual racing game for kids. It’s a sport that brings people together, no matter what their age or skill level.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the definitive version of the game that some people have been playing for over 25 years. You’re not going to find better graphics or more features anywhere else. This is your one-stop shop for everything Mario Kart.

You might think that a game with a reputation for being overly simplistic would bore someone who’s been playing video games for years, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.
Mario Kart is a game that you can play for hours and never get bored of. It’s perfect to play with friends, family members, and even strangers online — so long as they’re of the kid-friendly variety.

## Rocket League

You may have heard of Rocket League. They’ve been screaming “sports-action” at us for years now.
And they’re right — this game is a great way to get a taste of the sports genre without all of the overly complicated rules and regulations.
And it’s not just a terrible pun: Rocket League is a great game for folks new to video games. It’s easy to pick up and play, but it has enough depth that you can put hundreds of hours into it without feeling like you’ve mastered everything.

This is one of the best cooperative games for newbies. You’ll have to work together with your teammates to score goals and win. If you’re the type of gamer who likes to shoot first and ask questions never, this one probably isn’t for you. But if you want to play a fun, lighthearted game with friends and family members, Rocket League is perfect.

## Outlast 2

This one is for the horror fans. If you’re new to video games, you may not have heard of Outlast. It’s a survival horror game about a journalist investigating an asylum for the criminally insane.
In other words, it’s perfect for folks looking to jump into scary games.
As a survival horror game, Outlast 2 is all about making you feel tense. Your character has no special powers — you can’t run incredibly fast or wield supernatural powers like a certain Jedi. You have no weapons, either. You’re just stuck with your wits and a camcorder.

If you’re new to horror games, they can be intimidating. But a lot of the scarier titles out there are also notoriously bad. Outlast 2 is a great example of how to do genuinely terrifying well. It’s got some flaws, but as far as horror games go it’s one of the best.

## What are your favourite games for newbies?

Dragon Ball FighterZ: This is a fighting game that’s easy to pick up but has a ton of depth. You don’t need to know the entire Dragon Ball Z story arc to enjoy this game.

Hollow Knight: This is an incredibly challenging platformer that has a surprising amount of depth and replayability. You can play it as many times as you like without getting bored.

Blue Toad Murder Files: This is a point-and-click adventure game that lets you solve a murder mystery with a cute blue toad detective. It’s an easy game to play, but it’s also got some depth.

Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze: This is a great platformer for folks of all skill levels. You can play it for just a few minutes at a time or for hours at a time.

## Summing up

Newbies to gaming don’t need to wade through reams of release dates and review scores to find the right game. All they have to do is follow one simple rule: find a game that’s easy to get into.
You’re not going to be able to jump into Call of Duty or Destiny right off the bat. They’re too complicated, too obtuse. Start with a game that’s simple and straightforward.
Play the game in its default setting. If you see a bunch of sliders or options, don’t play around with them. Simplicity is key when you’re first starting out.
