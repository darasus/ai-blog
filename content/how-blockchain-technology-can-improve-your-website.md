summary: A blockchain is a distributed ledger that enables people and
  organizations to collaborate and transact with each other in new ways. It’s a
  technology that can be applied and used in many different industries such as
  healthcare, financial services, transportation, logistics, supply chain and
  more. Blockchains are designed to be transparent and unchangeable, so that
  individuals can trust each other even if they don't know each other. The
  decentralized nature of the system means that no single entity controls the
  system. The system can’t be altered or hacked because each block is linked to
  the previous block.
intro: >-
  Today, businesses are struggling to keep up with the pace of digital
  transformation and the growing expectations of their customers. There is a
  general feeling that something big is about to happen. The Internet as we know
  it is changing, and new ways to use data are being invented every day. In this
  rapidly shifting landscape, blockchain technology stands out as one of the
  most disruptive innovations. 

  But what exactly is blockchain technology? In a nutshell, it’s a decentralized ledger that stores information in places called blocks. Whenever someone wants to add information or a transaction to the ledger, they first need to verify themselves by supplying proof of identity. Each block also has its own unique identifier known as a hash. These identifiers help track information easily without having to store an entire copy of each block, which reduces space significantly and speeds up data transfer speeds significantly.

## What is blockchain technology and why should you care?

A blockchain is a decentralized database that keeps track of records and digital events. This technology enables people to interact and transact directly with one another, without the need for a middleman. These ledgers are designed to be transparent and unchangeable, so that individuals can trust each other even if they don't know each other. Blockchain technology represents a new way of conducting transactions and a new way of thinking about economic interactions. As such, it will have a significant impact on the future of work, the future of business, and the future of the economy.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger that enables people and organizations to collaborate and transact with each other in new ways. It’s a technology that can be applied and used in many different industries such as healthcare, financial services, transportation, logistics, supply chain and more. What makes it so special is that it’s decentralized, autonomous, secure and transparent.

## How Blockchain Technology Works

A blockchain is a secure, decentralized, and transparent digital ledger that records transactions between two parties. It’s a type of database that allows all parties to interact, transact, and share data from anywhere in the world. Blockchain’s distributed network lets people who don’t know each other exchange value through secure digital contracts, with no need for a third party to validate or enforce the terms of the agreement.

Blockchain technology uses a consensus mechanism to validate transactions, which makes it very transparent. The system can’t be altered or hacked because each block is linked to the previous block, and changing one block would change the rest of the chain. However, the system can be amended if the parties involved decide to alter the terms of their agreement. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that no single entity controls the system. This means that participants don’t need to trust their data to a third party, and they maintain control of their assets.

## Blockchains in Advertising

Advertisers are under pressure to ensure that their ad spend is as efficient as possible. At the same time, consumers are increasingly distrustful of the advertising they see. It’s important that marketers find ways to overcome these challenges while also meeting their contractual obligations with publishers. Blockchain technology can help by providing a more secure and transparent way to manage ad spend.

For example, you can use blockchain technology to store the terms and conditions that govern your advertising spend. The data can be stored in a single, unchangeable location and be easily verified by the parties involved. Advertisers can use the same system to show conclusively that they’ve met their contractual obligations. Publishers can access the same data to verify that they’ve been paid correctly.

## Blockchain-based identification verification

Blockchain technology can also be used to verify identity. If you consider the current systems used to validate identity, they’re relatively slow and lack transparency. Blockchain can speed up the process while also increasing the level of transparency involved. Data stored on a blockchain can be verified quickly and easily. You can also use blockchain to store sensitive data without the need for an intermediary. This lets you create an identity validation system that’s encrypted and secure.

You can use blockchain to verify any type of identity, whether it’s medical, financial, or civic. It’s also possible to create a system that lets different entities interact and share data. For example, you could use blockchain to let health insurance providers exchange data with doctors. It’s important to note that different blockchains have different levels of security. If you’re interested in identity validation, you should use the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Smart Contracts

Another way that blockchain technology can improve the digital advertising landscape is through the use of smart contracts. These digital contracts can automate payment based on the results of an analysis. For example, you can create a smart contract that pays a publisher after your ad network verifies that a certain number of people have clicked on your ad. This is an excellent way to mitigate risk in a very manual industry.

Blockchain networks can also be used to create smart contracts that can be seen by everyone involved. This can help to ensure that all parties are abiding by their contractual obligations. You can also use blockchain to create a system that lets participants exchange funds before a contract is verified. Imagine that you’re a researcher who wants to collect data from a large number of respondents. With blockchain, you can create a secure, automated system that lets people contribute before they know whether they’ve been selected.

## Supply Chain Verification

The demand for transparency is high in all industries. Consumers want to know that the products they’re purchasing are high quality and ethically sourced. Blockchain technology can help brands to improve their supply chain management to provide transparency for their customers. This is especially helpful for companies with complex and wide-reaching supply chains.

Let’s say that you manufacture tennis shoes and sell them worldwide. With a blockchain-based supply chain, you can trace each pair of shoes from the factory where it was manufactured all the way to the store where it was sold. By leveraging blockchain technology, you can record your raw materials, the components that go into each pair of shoes, and the people involved in the creation process. You can also track the shoes once they’re sold to identify which distributor purchased them and where they were shipped. This is a great way to increase trust among customers.

## Consumer trading verification

Finally, blockchain technology can be used to verify consumer trading behavior. This type of verification is becoming increasingly important as the sharing economy grows more popular. For example, blockchain can be used to track the rate at which people exchange goods and services through platforms like Airbnb and Uber. It can also be used to track payments for goods and services. This type of analysis can help to identify fraud and manage risk.

By leveraging blockchain technology, you can create a decentralized ledger that tracks the rate at which goods and services are exchanged. This is a great way to increase transparency and ensure that consumers are abiding by the rules. You can use the same system to track payments to ensure that each party is making their fair contribution. 

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology is a relatively new concept that is expected to revolutionize digital transactions and data storage. When compared to traditional databases, blockchain technology is decentralized, encrypted, and transparent. Furthermore, data can be verified, and records cannot be altered retroactively. If you’re interested in leveraging blockchain technology to improve your digital operations, it’s important to identify the best use cases for your business.
