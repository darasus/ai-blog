As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually. Let\\u2019s take a look at some of the best coding tools that every developer should know about!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s easy to read and understand and has a much simpler syntax than other programming languages such as C or Java. Its simple syntax, readability, and general ease of use have made Python an extremely popular choice for new programmers. According to the census of programming languages from PYPL, Python is the third most widely used programming language globally with a usage of about 20%. Furthermore, Python was also identified as one of the top 10 fastest growing computer languages. This post will explain why you should learn Python, teach you everything you need to know about this wonderful coding language, and provide some resources for getting started.
