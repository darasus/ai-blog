It involves investing a fixed amount of money at different times\\u2014not just once. This way, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. As a result, your average cost per share is lower than if you had invested the entire amount at once.\nAs an example, let\\u2019s assume an investor has $10,000 to invest in stocks and has been debating between two companies: ABC stock and XYZ stock. If they put all $10,000 into XYZ stock today, it will be worth $9,900 tomorrow because XYZ stock will likely fall that much in value by then. In contrast, investing all $10,000 in ABc today will mean that it will be worth $11,100 tomorrow because ABC stock is likely to rise that much by then. Hence the investor decides to dollar cost average by investing $5,000 today and another $5,000 10 days from now in order to invest the final $5,000 30 days from now \\u2013 spending an equal dollar amount each time ($2,500 per investment).
