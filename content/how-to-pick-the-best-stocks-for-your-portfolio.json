Risk tolerance is your ability to withstand fluctuations in the market. It will greatly impact your ability to make successful investments, as well as the type of stocks you choose to buy. If you\\u2019re a high-risk investor, you might choose to invest only in the stocks of large, established companies that you think will have lots of staying power. These stocks are less likely to experience major swings in the market because their value is well-known. They are more likely to be a safe bet for your portfolio.\nIf you\\u2019re a low-risk investor, you may choose to invest in startup companies with relatively low valuations that have a high growth potential.

If an industry suffers a significant loss, you can rest easy knowing that your portfolio is well diversified.\nDiversification can be done a few different ways. You can choose to spread your money across multiple industries, or you can choose to spread it across different types of stocks within a particular industry. If you pick multiple industries, you may want to invest in stocks of companies that produce different types of products or provide different services.
