However, the word \\u2018processed\\u2019 can be misleading.\nProcessed foods almost always have a shorter shelf life than their unprocessed counterparts. This is because they have been altered in some way to make them last longer and to make them more convenient to consume. Processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy and unprocessed foods aren\\u2019t always healthy.\nProcessing can take many forms. Some examples of processed foods include canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, oils that have been refined or hydrogenated (as in Crisco), salt, sugar and starch that has been extracted from its original source (as in corn syrup or white sugar), spices that have been ground up, protein that has had artificial flavors or preservatives added to it (as in MSG), or food that has had artificial colors added to it (such as Red 40).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

If so, you\\u2019re right! Eating fish has many health benefits, including reducing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Eating fish is also one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fats, which your body can\\u2019t produce on its own and must get from food. These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. However, not all types of fish have the same benefits. Here are some reasons why salmon should be a staple part of your diet.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
