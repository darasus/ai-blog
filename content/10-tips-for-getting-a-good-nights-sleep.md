intro: >-
  Getting enough sleep is one of the most important things you can do to
  take care of yourself. Sleep is when your body and mind repair themselves from
  the stresses of the day. It’s also when memories are consolidated and mental
  performance improves. 

  If you aren’t getting enough sleep, you might feel stressed or anxious, find it hard to concentrate or solve problems, and be more prone to memory lapses and minor cognitive errors. Not getting enough sleep can also increase your risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and obesity. The National Institute of Health reports that adults should get about 7-9 hours of sleep each night for optimum health. 

  Getting a good night’s sleep isn’t always easy. But if you implement these ten tips into your routine you will be on your way to feeling rested and rejuvenated come morning time:

## Turn off the screens an hour before bedtime.

One thing that can seriously affect your sleep is the blue light emitted from electronic devices. Blue light is a wavelength found in natural sunlight and is needed to synchronize your circadian rhythm. However, staring at electronic devices, like your phone and tablet, will emit blue light that will confuse your body and trick it into thinking it’s still daylight. This can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it almost impossible to fall asleep.

## Make your bedroom dark and cool.

The key to a good night’s sleep is to create a soothing and relaxing atmosphere in your bedroom. To do this, make sure the area is dark and cool. Being in a dark and cool environment will help your body relax and fall into a restful sleep. You can also try using a white noise machine to drown out any distracting noises that might be keeping you awake.

## Create a ritual to help you relax before bed.

If you’re someone who has trouble falling asleep, keeping a bedtime ritual in place might help. Having a calming and relaxing routine right before bedtime can be a great way to induce sleepiness and get your head in the right place for a good night’s sleep. Try reading a book, meditating, taking a bath, or listening to relaxing music.

## Exercise during the day — not just at night.

Exercising during the day will help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and sleep better. Exercise is beneficial in many ways but one of the most important is that it helps regulate your sleeping pattern. People who exercise regularly fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer than those who don’t exercise.

## Don’t drink alcohol to help you fall asleep.

Alcohol is a depressant, which means it will actually make it harder for you to fall asleep. Once you’ve had that drink, your body will have to work extra hard to try and process and flush out the alcohol from your system, which will leave you tossing and turning in bed.

## Don’t eat a big dinner late at night either.

While eating a large dinner before bed is generally a good idea, you don’t want to do so right before going to sleep. Eating a large meal close to bedtime will prompt your body to release high levels of insulin, which can make you feel restless and disrupt your sleep.

## Maintain a healthy diet all through the day.

Eating a balanced and healthy diet is important for your health in general, but it’s also critical for getting enough sleep. Foods rich in tryptophan such as eggs, dairy, fish, and poultry are excellent for inducing sleep. Avoid caffeine and sugary foods as much as possible during the day.

## Don’t skimp on the quality of your mattress or pillow.

Scientists from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that the average person should spend about a third of their lives sleeping. A good quality mattress and pillow can go a long way in helping you rest and relax while sleeping. If you find that you don’t sleep well, you might want to consider investing in a better mattress.

## Try meditating or practicing breathing exercises before bedtime.

Meditation and breathing exercises are great ways to help you unwind and get in the right headspace to fall asleep. Many people find that practicing a few minutes of relaxation exercises before bed can be a great way to relax their muscles, clear their minds, and get to sleep quicker.

## Conclusion

Getting enough sleep is a crucial part of staying healthy. Getting enough sleep helps maintain your energy levels, weight, mental health, and more. Make sure to get enough sleep by using these tips to help you fall asleep.

If you follow these tips and make sleep a priority, you will feel more energized, creative, and productive. You will likely feel less stressed and anxious, find it easier to concentrate or solve problems, and be less prone to memory lapses and minor cognitive errors. You might even lose a few pounds or inches from your waistline. Getting a good night’s sleep doesn’t always come easily, but it is absolutely worth it.
