Eminem's "Revival" is a mess. The album is disjointed, unfocused, and often feels like it's trying too hard to be something it's not. It's not a bad album, but it's not a good one either. The best thing that can be said about it is that it's a step up from "Relapse," but that's not saying much.

The biggest problem with "Revival" is that it feels like Eminem is trying to force himself to be something he's not. He's clearly not comfortable rapping about his personal life, but he tries to do it anyway. The result is an album that feels phony and inauthentic.

Eminem is at his best when he's rapping about what he knows best: himself. "Revival" would have been a much better album if he had just stuck to that. As it is, the album feels like a missed opportunity.
