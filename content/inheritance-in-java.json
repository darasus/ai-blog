This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another.

In fact, IDC estimates that worldwide public cloud services will grow from $206 billion in revenue in 2017 to $345 billion by 2021. New types of cloud services are also emerging every day.\nA majority of organizations now use cloud services as part of their IT strategy. From handling peak demand to reducing costs and improving availability, cloud-based services have proven their worth for many businesses. Even so, making the move can be challenging for IT professionals and software developers. There are several considerations when choosing which programming language is best for creating software applications for the cloud, including the following:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s simple, fast, and predictable with no unnecessary syntax and a lightweight syntax that leads to programs that are easy to read and understand.\nGo has several built-in features that let it stand out from other general programming languages. For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
