This leads us to ask a very logical question \\u2013 can we reuse code even further? The answer is yes! We can take one class and make it so that it extends the functionality of another.

These little tricks make life easier for anyone who is just getting started with coding and doesn\\u2019t have time to invest in learning every last bit of it before they can start creating useful programs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually.
