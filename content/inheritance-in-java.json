  "summary": "Inheritance is the process of taking one class and making it so that it extends the functionality of another. This means that the code that was implemented in the parent class can be used in the child class. This way, youâ€™ll have a single point of code where that functionality is defined and you can reuse it as many times as you want. If you want to reuse code that has been implemented in a different class, then you should use inheritance. This is just one of the reasons why you might want to take advantage of inheritance.",
