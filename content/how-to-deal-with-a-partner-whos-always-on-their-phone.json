It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters. Being insecure and accusatory about something as innocent as checking messages isn\\u2019t likely to lead anywhere positive, after all.

If they\\u2019re simply being social on their phone, it\\u2019s important to understand that.

You may not like the fact that they\\u2019re always on their phone, but once you understand that there is a reason for it, it can become a lot easier to let it go.\nOne way of doing this is by setting boundaries together. Rather than just complaining about your partner being on the phone all the time, you can negotiate with them to set aside certain periods of time when they have to put the cell down.

If you and your partner are both frequently on your phones, it\\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that you could simply be talking to the same person.\nDon\\u2019t use the fact that your partner is always on their phone as an excuse to start an affair of your own.

It\\u2019s a way of resolving disputes that is less adversarial than litigation and usually cheaper, faster, and more private than other methods. Mediation is also collaborative as well as neutral. The mediator acts as a neutral party who helps the parties attempt to resolve their dispute in a fair and equitable manner.\nIn mediation, both parties together with their respective attorneys choose from various options to settle the case outside of court. The goal of mediation is to find solutions that are agreeable to both parties. It\\u2019s about finding win-win solutions instead of win-lose outcomes. It\\u2019s about exploring solutions that may not have been considered had the parties not been under the guidance of a mediator who has no stake in either outcome of the dispute other than seeing it resolved amicably and fairly so that everyone walks away feeling like they have gained something from it rather than having given up something they would rather have kept.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The answer is: quite a lot. A single photograph has the power to change opinions, shape perceptions, and even alter the course of history.\nLet\\u2019s take for example, the most iconic cat photos of all time; whether you love them or hate them, their fame cannot be denied. These are images that have been shared on social media sites and printed on t-shirts and posters across the globe. And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there\\u2019s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
