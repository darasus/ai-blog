After all, it\\u2019s 2018, and smartphones are practically a necessity for anyone who wants to stay connected. But if your partner is glued to their cell 24/7, it can obviously become a source of tension between you two. It\\u2019s natural to feel a little jealous when someone you care about spends more time texting than talking with you, after all. And this is especially true if they seem to be ignoring you while they do so.\nIf your partner always seems to be on their phone, there could be several explanations \\u2014 from an online affair to simply being an avid social media user. Regardless of the reasons why your partner might spend so much time on their phone, though, the way that you react definitely matters.

If they\\u2019re simply being social on their phone, it\\u2019s important to understand that.

You may not like the fact that they\\u2019re always on their phone, but once you understand that there is a reason for it, it can become a lot easier to let it go.\nOne way of doing this is by setting boundaries together. Rather than just complaining about your partner being on the phone all the time, you can negotiate with them to set aside certain periods of time when they have to put the cell down.
