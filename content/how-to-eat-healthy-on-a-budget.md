  How much does buying healthy food cost? For some it might be a small
  splurge, for others, a luxury they can’t afford. Either way, eating healthy on
  a budget isn’t easy. Eating less processed and pre-packaged foods is one way
  to cut costs and stay healthy at the same time. Another way is to get creative
  and buy things when they are on special or use cheaper alternatives like
  frozen or canned versions of fruits and veggies instead of the fresh ones.
  There are many ways to do this that won’t leave you feeling deprived while
  still giving your body what it needs to be healthy. 

  For those who eat a lot of fast food or find themselves eating unhealthy because it’s cheaper than buying wholesome foods, these tips will help you make healthier choices while saving money at the same time.

## Plan Your Meals

Before you even head to the grocery store, have a game plan for what meals you are going to make. Having a list of dishes you want to make will help you avoid making impulse purchases at the store since you will already have the things you need. If you have a meal plan, you can use sales and coupons to your advantage and buy ingredients for your meals. Try cooking once per week and portioning out different meals for the following days so you have food ready for you to quickly heat up when you don’t have time to cook or feel like going out.

You can also use meal planning apps like MealMap or Food planning services like HelloFresh to help you stay on track when trying to eat healthy on a budget.

## Grow Your Own Food

Growing your own food is one of the best ways to save money, and it can also help you eat healthier. If you live in a place where you can grow your own food, you can save money while getting more fresh produce than you could ever buy. Growing your own food doesn’t have to be an expensive hobby either. There are many organic gardening methods you can use without spending a fortune, and there are many places where you can get organic seeds for a low price. Growing your own food can be a fun way to get your kids involved and eating healthier, but remember that it’s a lot of work, so don’t get into it if you don’t have the time. Growing your own food can be time consuming, but it’s still a great way to save money while eating healthier if you have the time.

## Shop The Perimeter

The best way to save money and eat healthier is to shop the perimeter of the grocery store. This means that you should avoid the center aisles of the store where the processed foods and sugary snacks are located. Instead, you should shop the perimeter of the store where you will find fresh produce, healthy snacks, and whole grain items. This way, you will be less likely to buy unhealthy processed foods that are not only expensive but don’t provide your body with the nutrients it needs for optimum health.

If you are used to buying processed foods and snacks, it may be hard to get into the habit of shopping the perimeter of the store. It may help to keep a shopping list, so you don’t forget something you need while shopping.

## Buy Frozen And Canned Produce

While fresh produce is a better choice, frozen and canned produce is still better than none at all. Frozen produce can be just as nutritious as fresh produce, and it’s cheaper. Canned produce isn’t as good as the fresh variety, but it’s still better than nothing. Frozen and canned produce go on sale often enough that you can stock up when they are cheaper, and even freeze them so you have them on hand for a quick meal. Frozen and canned produce are great for quick meals such as stir fries and casseroles, or for adding to a meal you’ve already made to increase the amount of vegetables you’re eating. Frozen and canned produce may not be as nutritious as fresh, but it’s still better for you than no vegetables at all.

## Bagged Leafy Greens

Bagged leafy greens are a lot cheaper than the fresh variety and taste just as good. If you want to eat more greens, but they are too expensive, try buying the bagged variety instead. Bagged greens are also better for you than most of the junk foods most people buy when they are trying to save money. You can use the bags of greens in just about any way you would fresh greens. They can be used in salads, sandwiches, and soups. They are also great to have on hand when you need to quickly eat a healthy meal since they can be microwaved and eaten in only a few minutes.

## Beans and Lentils

Although they are high in protein, beans and lentils are also very cheap. They are also full of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They can be used in many different recipes, and you can even cook them in bulk and freeze them for quick meals. Beans and lentils are so cheap and nutritious, many people call them poor man’s meat. They are great additions to soups and stews, and they are also great in tacos and burritos. Beans and lentils are perfect for anyone trying to save money while eating healthier since they are cheap and full of vitamins and minerals that your body needs.

## Conclusion

Regardless of how much you have to spend, you can still eat healthy. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be expensive, but it does take a little bit of effort. Eating healthy on a budget requires some planning and creativity, but it’s not impossible. From growing your own food to buying canned produce and buying frozen produce, there are many ways to eat healthy on a budget.
