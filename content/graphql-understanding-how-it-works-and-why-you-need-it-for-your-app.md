summary: With GraphQL, you can build a single API that can be accessed from a
  variety of clients. This means that, if your app uses a GraphQL API and
  another app has the same requirements, then you can reuse the same API. This
  cuts down development time, reduces costs, and improves the overall quality of
  your app. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and it's easier for developers
  to document their code and standardize their documentation. You can use the
  Apollo GraphQL client to build GraphQL server in Android, Swift, Java, and
  React Native.
intro: >-
  Google has introduced a variety of tools and frameworks for mobile app
  developers to make their lives easier and the users experience better. 

  One such tool is GraphQL, which is now becoming increasingly popular among mobile app developers. Why? Because it offers a lot of benefits over other JSON APIs. Developers no longer need to hardcode endpoints or query data directly from an API; GraphQL abstracts that logic away, letting developers focus on their code instead of the data access layer.

  Let’s see what makes GraphQL so useful in the world of mobile apps.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It allows you to fetch data from a single endpoint, which makes it easy to build applications. With GraphQL, you can build a single API which can be accessed from a variety of clients, whether that’s a web application, another mobile app, or even an internal business system.

Let’s say your company opens up a new internal app that employees can use to track their time and billable hours. You decide to use GraphQL as the data layer to power this new app. Since GraphQL is a single API, you don’t have to create a new endpoint or change the existing one. Instead, your existing backend can simply respond to the same request with a different payload based on the new client that’s making the request.

## Build a Single API with GraphQL

As we said before, one of the biggest advantages of GraphQL is the ability to build a single API that can be accessed from a variety of clients. This means that, if your app uses a GraphQL API and another app has the same requirements, then you can reuse the same API. This cuts down development time, reduces costs, and improves the overall quality of your app.

Suppose you’re building a mobile app for a hotel chain. The app lets guests book rooms, check out their reservations, and manage their account. In addition, the app allows guests to view their upcoming reservations and make changes to the booking if necessary. To build this app, you first create a GraphQL server that can handle the data requests. The GraphQL server then returns a response containing the information necessary for the app to run.

## The Problems with JSON APIs

However, as useful as JSON APIs can be, they do have a few drawbacks. Once you decide on a JSON API, you have to build all your data access logic around it. In other words, you have to hardcode the data access layer by querying the API directly.
This approach has the potential to create a few issues.

- You can’t Scale - If you hardcode your app’s data access logic, it’s difficult to adjust to growing or declining user demand. If you have millions of users, querying your API directly can be a costly and time-consuming process.

- You Can’t Change the API - Another downside of querying the API directly is that you can’t change the API’s endpoints without making changes to your data layer. This can spell disaster if you decide to change the API without realizing the consequences.

- Your Data Access Logic is Hard to Maintain - It can be difficult to maintain the data access logic in your app. If the logic is complex, or if you have multiple developers working on the app, then everyone will have to refer back to the original API documentation.

## GraphQL Benefits

Besides being able to build a single API that can be accessed by a variety of clients, GraphQL offers a few other advantages as well.

- Stronger Communication - When your app developers use GraphQL, they can easily communicate their data requirements to the API team. This cuts down on miscommunication and uncovers potential issues before they can become major problems.

- Better Documentation - Since GraphQL works as a single API, it’s easier for developers to document their code. This means you can build reusable components and standardize your documentation.

- Stronger Architecture - The single API that GraphQL offers means that your data architecture is stronger and more consistent. This makes it easier to add new features and scale your architecture as your app grows.

## How to Implement a GraphQL API in Android

With the benefits of using GraphQL in mind, let’s see how you can set up your GraphQL server in Android. To create a GraphQL server, you’ll need to use a GraphQL client and a GraphQL server.

You can use the Apollo GraphQL client to build the GraphQL server in Android. Apollo is a popular GraphQL client that supports Java, Android, JavaScript, and Swift. You can also use the GraphQL server that’s built into the React Native framework. If you’re using Java, then you can use the GraphQL Java library. You can also use the GraphQL server that’s built into the Spring framework.

## Conclusion

At this point, you should have a strong understanding of what GraphQL is, why it is useful, and how it works.

Once you implement a GraphQL API in your app, you can focus on building better features and improving your user experience, knowing that you’re using a strong architecture.

Combined with the best practices for using GraphQL, these benefits make using GraphQL in your app a no-brainer.
