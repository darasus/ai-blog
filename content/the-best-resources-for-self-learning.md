## Audible

There are lots of different ways to get audiobooks these days, but audiobooks are excellent for self-learning.
While you’re driving, cleaning, or doing other activities where it isn’t convenient to be reading from a book or on a screen, audiobooks can easily keep your brain engaged and trained.
Audiobooks are particularly useful for learning subjects like public speaking, sales, and marketing, which involve skills that can be easier to learn from an audio format.
Try Audible for 30 days and get two audiobooks for free, so you can see for yourself how useful audiobooks can be for self-learning.

## Course Repositories

Courses are a great way to get a comprehensive overview of a topic, and then later dig in to more specific subtopics once you’ve covered the basics.
Courses like those offered by Coursera and edX are typically free, and often offered by top universities around the world.
Courses on platforms like these are usually broken down into modules with accompanying reading material, video lectures, and other interactive components.
Courses and MOOCs (massive open online courses) are a great way to get a quick overview of a new topic, and can really help you narrow down what you want to learn more about.

## eBooks and Kindle

If you want to learn more about a specific subject, there are probably eBooks available on the topic. Plus, you can read them just about anywhere.
If you’re interested in learning more about something like art history, economics, or psychology, chances are there’s an eBook (or multiple) on the subject you can download and start reading right away.
Ebooks are usually written by authors and experts in their fields, and are a great way to delve into more specific topics that interest you.
Some e-readers, like the Kindle, allow you to highlight and bookmark important passages as you read, so that you can easily come back to them later.

## Google and YouTube

If you’re interested in learning more about a specific skill or subject, Google is your best friend. Type in the topic, followed by the word “lessons” or “tutorials.” You’ll be surprised at the kinds of results that will pop up.
You’ll find a host of different websites that offer tutorials on everything from coding to gardening.
You can also use YouTube as a resource for self-learning. Many YouTube channels are devoted to teaching different skills, from how to do make-up, to learning a new language.

## iBooks

If you’re interested in learning more about a specific topic, but have yet to decide exactly where to start, iBooks’ What to Read feature can help.
This feature allows you to select topics that interest you, and then iBooks will suggest books that might interest you based on those topics.
You can also look through the iBooks Store to see what books are currently trending, and what books are most popular with other readers.

## iTunes U

iTunes U offers free audio and video content related to a variety of subjects.
You can learn about everything from business and marketing, to history, language arts, philosophy, religion, and science.
iTunes U is a great resource if you’d like to learn more about a specific topic but don’t know where to start. You can browse by category or what’s trending to find something that interests you.

## Learning Games

If you’re interested in learning a new skill or expanding your horizons, but aren’t exactly sure what you’d like to learn, you can browse through some of the games that are designed to teach you new things.
For example, you can learn how to code by playing a game like Code Hero, or you can learn a new language by playing a game like Duolingo.
You can get a casual introduction to a lot of different subjects, and if you find a game or two that interests you, you can go from there and explore more.

## Library

If you’re looking for something a bit more in-depth, or want to read about specific topics in-depth, the library is another great resource for self-learning.
You can find books on just about any topic, and many public libraries have online resources that make it easy to find the specific books you’re looking for.
If you have a specific subject that you’d like to learn more about, you can also request an article or book recommendation from your librarian.

## Screenwriting Software

If you’re interested in learning more about the art of screenwriting, you can try screenwriting software.
This software allows you to write scripts just like you would on paper, but with the added benefit of being able to see the progress you’ve made (scores and graphs), and being able to easily edit and revise your work.
You can also submit your scripts to a community of other screenwriters, so that you can receive feedback and make your work even better.

## Summing up

Self-learning can be a great way to advance your career and explore topics you're passionate about.
There are lots of different ways to get started, and once you're engaged in your new learning, it can be easy to stay motivated.

There are tons of ways to learn, but it's important to select the right ones that work for you. You should be choosing resources that keep you engaged and actively pursuing new knowledge.
