  "summary": "A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that uses tokens to represent people and assets that have been verified and placed onto a ledger. This allows for a new form of trust and transparency that is not currently possible with existing systems. The blockchain technology has solved a variety of issues involving data sharing and security, transparency, validation, and data availability across industries. It has the potential to create an entirely new digital ecosystem where businesses and individuals can trade and interact without the need for intermediaries.
