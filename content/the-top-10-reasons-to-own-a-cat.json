However, owning a cat is fast becoming one of the most common household pets in the world. Almost a third of all households now own at least one cat, with many seeing them as more than just an independent pet but also a friend.Now let\\u2019s get this out of the way: Most people who own cats would tell you they do so because they love them. But why? What is it about these often aloof creatures that prompts so many people to give up their time, attention and money to keep one as a pet?

Most cats will take care of their waste outside of the home and not inside, for this reason many people choose cats as a more hygienic pet over dogs. Cats also don\\u2019t need to be bathed as often as other pets like dogs do, so they can save you money on grooming products and trips to the vet. Cats are also very good at keeping themselves groomed, so they rarely shed as much as other animals do making them a good indoor pet for people with allergies.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"They Help You Deal With Stress And Depression\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re suffering from stress or depression, owning a cat might just be the answer. There have been a number of studies done to measure the effects a cat has on its owner, and most of them show that owning a cat can actually help reduce your stress and improve your mood. Cats are often seen as a companion who is there for you in your happiest of times and your darkest moments, and owning one can make a huge difference in your mental health.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"They Can Be Good Training For Children Or Dogs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats are great for training children how to behave around animals, especially if the child has allergies. Cats also like being around children and can be very affectionate and loving to them, something that dogs are less likely to be. Cats are very easy to train with positive reinforcement, so if you decide to train your cat to do tricks or certain behaviors they will be a lot easier than training a dog. If you have a young child and are thinking of getting a pet, a cat will be a better option as they are less likely to knock things over, damage furniture, or accidentally hurt a child like a dog might.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cats Are Independent, So You Don\\u2019t Have To Always Be There\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the most common traits of cats is their independence. Unlike dogs who are always happy to be around their owner and be pet or played with, cats are happy to do their own thing. There are also many benefits to a cat being independent. For example, they don\\u2019t need to be walked or taken outside to go to the bathroom, and they don\\u2019t need to be taken for vaccinations either. They are also self-sufficient in the sense that they don\\u2019t need to be fed at certain times. This is all down to how cats are designed; they generally eat once a day at night when their owners are asleep.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cats Are Good Manners Trainers For Dogs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you own both a dog and a cat, you might find that your dog is more mellow and well-behaved when around the cat. Cats are a good training companion for dogs in the same way they are for children. Dogs can be very excitable and jumpy around cats, especially if they\\u2019re used to living with just a dog. However, if you have a cat and a dog together, you might find that the cat can help combat this behavior. Cats are generally very relaxed and calm animals, so if a dog is excited and barking aggressively around them, a cat won\\u2019t react and can help settle dogs that are hyper.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cats Are Great Fitness Guides\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats are often known as the ultimate couch potato, but this isn\\u2019t always the case. Many cats are naturally athletic and love to climb and play with toys. If you have a cat who loves to climb and jump, they can make great playmates for children or adults who want to stay active. Cats can also be great guides for people who want to start running as they are natural hunters and will often challenge their owner to be more active. There are even events that happen called cat marathons, where people run with a cat on their back.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Cats Are Incredible Hunters And After-Dark Guardians\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats are known as being fierce predators, and they are very adaptable hunters. They can hunt at any time of day and many cats prefer to hunt at night when you are in bed sleeping. Cats make excellent after-dark guardians, as they are very territorial and will attack any animals coming close to their home. Cats are also great for keeping rodents away from your home, as they are natural hunters that feed on small mammals. Many people who live in areas with rodents will put out cat food to encourage cats to come into their garden and keep the rodents away.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Final Words\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats are often seen as aloof and independent creatures, but there are many reasons why owning a cat can be a rewarding experience. Cats can be great for people who want to keep active, as they love to play, explore and climb. They are also excellent hunters, keeping a home free of rodents and other pests. Cats are also great pets for people with allergies, as they are self-cleaning, don\\u2019t need to be bathed and rarely shed.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Cats are also good companions in times of stress or depression and are great for training children or dogs.
