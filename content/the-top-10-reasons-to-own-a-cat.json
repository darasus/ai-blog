Most cats will take care of their waste outside of the home and not inside, for this reason many people choose cats as a more hygienic pet over dogs. Cats also don\\u2019t need to be bathed as often as other pets like dogs do, so they can save you money on grooming products and trips to the vet.

Unlike dogs who are always happy to be around their owner and be pet or played with, cats are happy to do their own thing. There are also many benefits to a cat being independent. For example, they don\\u2019t need to be walked or taken outside to go to the bathroom, and they don\\u2019t need to be taken for vaccinations either.

However, if you have a cat and a dog together, you might find that the cat can help combat this behavior.
