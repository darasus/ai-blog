## Understanding Food Trends

Food trends are the latest culinary fads that capture the imaginations of customers. Trends often stem from a single source, like a celebrity chef or a new type of cuisine, and then spread across the culinary landscape as customers adopt the trend.

Trends are not just limited to what people eat. They can also include how they eat, like trendy new ways of serving food or eating occasions. Food and beverage companies will typically follow trends closely as a way to better understand consumer tastes and preferences.

Following food trends can be a great way to keep your business fresh by bringing new customers through your doors. At the same time, there is a risk in getting caught up in trends. If you jump on a food trend bandwagon that fizzles out quickly, you could end up alienating your core customers and damaging your business’s reputation.

## How to Track Food Trends

There are several ways you can keep track of food trends, including reading industry blogs, magazines, and websites. There are also trend tracking services that are specifically geared towards restaurants. These types of services can help you collect and organize information on food trends so that you can quickly respond to any new developments.

If you’re looking to simply stay on top of current trends, you can also keep an eye on what’s being talked about on social media outlets like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. These platforms are great ways to see what types of foods are trending right now.

If you have customers coming in regularly, you can also ask them what they’re seeing other people eating that they’d like to try.

## When to Jump on the Food Trend Bandwagon

There is no hard and fast rule for when to jump on a food trend bandwagon. That being said, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on what types of foods and recipes are trending at the moment. And if you’re looking for ways to boost your bottom line, it’s a great idea to jump on a bandwagon when it makes sense for your business.

For example, if you operate a chain of sandwich shops, it might not make sense for you to get on the ramen bandwagon. Sure, the trend of serving ramen as a trendy alternative to pasta is definitely growing. But you wouldn’t be capitalizing on that trend if you’ve got pasta on the menu.

## When to Hold the Bag (or basket, or couscous…)

Sometimes it might seem like every other food trend is blowing up, then suddenly, a whole new set of foods are topping the charts. If you’re following food trends, you might find yourself adding a couple of new menu items every month or so. But there’s a point at which a business can get spread too thinly by trying to keep up with trends.

The best way to know when you should hold the bag on a trend is to look at how customers respond to it. If your customers are excited about the new items you added to your menu, that’s great. If, on the other hand, customers aren’t ordering those items, it might be time to put the brakes on any other food trends you might be considering.

## What to look for when deciding whether to follow a food trend.

When you’re trying to decide whether a food trend is worth following, it can be helpful to look at the data behind that trend. You can see, for example, whether the overall trend is growing or shrinking, which can provide insight into how long it might last.

You can also look at which specific elements of the trend are growing. For example, in the ramen trend example above, customers loved the idea of eating rich, hearty ramen noodles. But they were less thrilled about the fact that ramen is usually served in a broth. If you were thinking about following the ramen trend, you might want to wait for the next wave of the trend to come around.

## Bottom line

Food trends can be a great way to bring new customers into your business. At the same time, following food trends can also be risky. If you get caught up in fads that don’t have staying power, you could end up damaging your reputation and hurting your bottom line.

To follow food trends successfully, you’ll want to keep an eye on what people are eating now. You can also ask your customers what they’re seeing other people eating that they’d like to try.
