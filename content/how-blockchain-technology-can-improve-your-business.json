Because the nodes are decentralized, no single entity controls the blockchain. Each node is also an administrator of the ledger and verifies each transaction\\u2019s validity before adding a new block to the chain. This means that any changes made to any block will show up as a discrepancy in the other ledgers, triggering those nodes to re-validate the chain. In addition to the nodes, a blockchain also consists of two more components: a network and a token. The network is the group of nodes that make up the blockchain and enable its functionality.

When applied to supply chain management, blockchain technology can be used to track the movement of goods from suppliers, through the production process, to the final customer. When applied to escrow services, blockchain technology can be used to verify the legitimacy of both the supplier and the customers by keeping track of digital assets like money in an account. Customers can then verify that the funds have been deposited in the account before the supplier can release the items they\\u2019ve purchased.

You can keep track of each part as it travels through the supply chain, recording shipping information like the dates and times, the names of the people involved and any other relevant data.

It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an earlier version of the blockchain code named \\u201CC Haskell\\u201D and later changed to \\u201CCardano\\u201D. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Both EOS and TRON are often referred to as \\u201Cthe Chinese Ethereum\\u201D due to the similarities in their functionality as well as their focus on becoming the primary blockchain for dApps.

In the world of computer programs and coding, it isn\\u2019t uncommon for someone to make a modified version of another person's code with the intention of adding some new feature or fixing problems with the original. For example, one might see an error in another programmer\\u2019s code and fix it to prevent other coders from encountering that problem as well. This is essentially what a fork in programming terms is: Take an old piece of code and make changes to improve it. A fork can happen when developers disagree about how to deal with an issue (which is not uncommon) or if there\\u2019s some other reason that makes them want to branch off from the original source code and go their own separate way.  Moreover, there are many different types of forks beyond just software!
