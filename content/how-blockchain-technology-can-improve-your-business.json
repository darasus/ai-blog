It\\u2019s a secure database because it isn\\u2019t kept in one place but instead shared across networks of computers that don\\u2019t belong to any central entity and can therefore\\u2019t be tampered with. A blockchain is made up of a series of \\u201Cblocks\\u201D that contain information about the transaction, including a time stamp, the type of asset being transferred, the amount of money or units being given and the account numbers of the parties involved. Each block is then connected to the previous block, and the blocks are also secured using cryptography.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Does Blockchain Work?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A blockchain is a decentralized database that\\u2019s made up of many different nodes, each of which has a full copy of the ledger and keeps track of validating the digital transactions, or blocks, that are added to the chain. Because the nodes are decentralized, no single entity controls the blockchain. Each node is also an administrator of the ledger and verifies each transaction\\u2019s validity before adding a new block to the chain. This means that any changes made to any block will show up as a discrepancy in the other ledgers, triggering those nodes to re-validate the chain. In addition to the nodes, a blockchain also consists of two more components: a network and a token. The network is the group of nodes that make up the blockchain and enable its functionality.

When applied to supply chain management, blockchain technology can be used to track the movement of goods from suppliers, through the production process, to the final customer. When applied to escrow services, blockchain technology can be used to verify the legitimacy of both the supplier and the customers by keeping track of digital assets like money in an account. Customers can then verify that the funds have been deposited in the account before the supplier can release the items they\\u2019ve purchased.

Blockchain technology can be used to track your supply chain using a distributed ledger that verifies each transaction. You can keep track of each part as it travels through the supply chain, recording shipping information like the dates and times, the names of the people involved and any other relevant data.
