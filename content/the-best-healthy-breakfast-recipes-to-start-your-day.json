Plus, they\\u2019re cheap and easy to prepare. The only potential downside to eating eggs is that they contain a decent amount of cholesterol, so if you\\u2019re at high risk for heart disease, you may want to avoid them.

Chia seeds have a fluffy texture and add a nutty flavor to many dishes. Flaxseeds are a bit crunchy and have an earthy flavor. Both can be added to a variety of dishes and are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Oatmeal\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Oatmeal is another great source of protein and fiber, making it a very healthy breakfast option. Plus, it\\u2019s very easy to make and can be eaten cold or hot. One downside to eating oatmeal is the high level of sugar found in many brands. To avoid this, try stirring in some natural sweeteners, like honey or maple syrup, to taste.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Be sure to use steel-cut oats as opposed to rolled oats, which are often processed and less nutritious. Steel-cut oats are a whole grain food that take longer to cook, but they\\u2019re well worth the wait. Unlike rolled oats, steel-cut oats are minimally processed, so they retain most of their fiber and nutrition.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Whole grain cereal\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Many people think of cereal as a quick and easy breakfast, but most brands aren\\u2019t very nutritious. To avoid the sugar-laden varieties, choose whole grain cereal, which contains more fiber and less sugar than its grain-based counterparts. If you\\u2019re worried about adding more fiber to your diet, drink a glass of milk with your cereal. Studies show that the calcium in milk helps moderate the blood-sugar-regulating effects of fiber.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re trying to lose weight, be sure to read the nutrition label.
