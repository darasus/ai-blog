To help you out with this, we have outlined some of the main pros and cons associated with using Go for embedded programming in this article:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Each has its pros and cons when it comes to the various tasks involved in database management such as creating views and stored procedures, monitoring performance, creating indexes, and auditing user access privileges.\nDBAs should have broad knowledge of different database management systems (DBMS) so they can identify which one is most suitable for each scenario. In general, there are three main types of DBMSs: Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), Document-oriented Database Management Systems (DDMS), and Hybrid Database Management Systems (HDBMS).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
