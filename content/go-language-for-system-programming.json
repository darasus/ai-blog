  "intro": "Even though software engineers may not think about it, almost every app on your phone, tablet, or laptop runs on an operating system. Everything from your camera to the apps you use to chat with friends requires software code that’s specifically designed for the operating system and its particular hardware architecture. These operating systems are often called “system programming languages” because they have a singular focus on the underlying system rather than end user applications. \nIf you look at any list of popular programming languages, you’ll see that Go is pretty uncommon - especially as a primary language used by system programmers and developers. However, there’s also been a lot of talk recently about how Go has become an excellent choice for projects that require intensive performance and tight memory usage. If you're interested in learning more about why this might be the case, read on to learn why Go is a good fit for system programming projects.",
  "content": "## Why is Go good for system programming?\n\nSystem programming languages are designed to be highly efficient and optimized for hardware as opposed to being designed to be easy to read, easy to write, or easy to maintain.\nGo was designed from the ground up to be great for system programming because it was designed to optimize for efficiency.\nPart of what makes Go a great choice for system programming projects is that it’s compiled and statically typed. This means that the language is less likely to produce runtime errors, which is extremely important for system programming. For example, if you’re writing a cryptography implementation, you want to make sure that there aren’t any bugs that could lead to someone breaking the cryptography and seeing the contents of your data.\nThe focus on optimization means that Go is also relatively easy to scale up, which is another important factor for system programming. You may need to optimize your software to run on a large server or scale it up to support thousands of users.\n\n## Memory Management Is Key For System Programming\n\nMemory management is one of the most important aspects of system programming, and highlights why Go is a good fit for such projects.\nGo is a garbage collected language, which means that it will automatically reclaim the memory that your software is not actively using.\nDepending on the project, you may need to use a specific memory management technology to handle sensitive data. For example, if you’re writing a cryptography implementation, you’ll want to make sure that you’re using a memory management technology that doesn’t leave behind a trail of data that could be used to break your cryptography.\nFor many projects, Go’s garbage collection is a good fit because it’s easy to set up and doesn’t require a lot of extra work on your end.\nHowever, for projects that require extremely sensitive data such as cryptography, a garbage collected language may not be the best choice because it leaves behind a trail of data that someone could potentially use to break the cryptography. For example, Go’s garbage collection leaves behind traces that contain information about how long it took to process different parts of the code, which could be used to help break the cryptography.\n\n## Go Has A Robust Package Management\n\nOne of the most important features of any programming language is its package management system. A robust package management system makes it easy to find and utilize third party packages written by other developers. This is especially true if you’re working on a team and need to use the tools your co-workers have chosen to use.\nGo’s package management system is called “Gorgoroh” and makes it easy to find and use packages by other developers.\nFor example, if you’re working on a project that uses machine learning, you’ll likely need to use a third party package to implement the ML algorithms. Since Go has a robust package management system, it’s easy to find the package you need and start using it.\nGo’s package management system is built into the language itself, which means that it’s easy to use no matter what sort of application you’re building.\n\n## Go Has Great Tooling\n\nGood tooling is important for any programming language, but it’s especially important for system programming languages.\nSystem programming languages are optimized to be efficient and run quickly, which is great if you’re writing a simple app but makes it difficult to debug errors.\nHowever, Go has robust debugging and profiling tools that make it easy to optimize your code and make sure it runs quickly.\nThe Go debugger is built into the Go language, which means that it’s easy to use and doesn’t require any additional software.\nGo’s debugging tool is lightweight, straightforward, and easy to use even for programmers that aren’t super familiar with the language.\n\n## Go’s Focus On High Performance AND Limiting RAM Usage\n\nGo’s focus on high performance is a major reason why it’s a good fit for system programming. However, this focus also makes it ideal for projects that need to minimize the amount of RAM used by the program.\nHowever, if your project requires highly efficient code execution but also needs to minimize RAM usage, you may need to use a specific version of the language.\nThis is because Google, the company that created and maintains Go, regularly releases new versions of the language with optimizations for speed and performance.\n\n## Go’s Language Specification And Standard Libraries\n\nMany programming languages are designed for general purpose use, but Go was designed to be used for system programming and thus has a very specific purpose.\nThis means that the language is designed to be extremely efficient and suited for specific tasks, which saves you time because you don’t have to learn a general purpose language that’s likely to be inefficient for your needs.\nFor example, if you’re writing a cryptography implementation, you’ll likely only use a few features of a language. This means that you don’t need to learn a general purpose language, which saves time and makes your code more efficient.\n\n## Summing Up\n\nGo is a great language for system programming because it was designed to optimize for efficiency and be easy to scale up. System programming languages are optimized to run quickly, efficiently, and use as little memory as possible.\nGo’s focus on performance and efficiency also makes it ideal for projects that require minimal RAM usage. Additionally, Go’s language specification and standardized libraries make it easy to get started without having to learn multiple languages."
