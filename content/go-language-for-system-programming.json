This means that the language is less likely to produce runtime errors, which is extremely important for system programming. For example, if you\\u2019re writing a cryptography implementation, you want to make sure that there aren\\u2019t any bugs that could lead to someone breaking the cryptography and seeing the contents of your data.\nThe focus on optimization means that Go is also relatively easy to scale up, which is another important factor for system programming.

For example, if you\\u2019re writing a cryptography implementation, you\\u2019ll want to make sure that you\\u2019re using a memory management technology that doesn\\u2019t leave behind a trail of data that could be used to break your cryptography.\nFor many projects, Go\\u2019s garbage collection is a good fit because it\\u2019s easy to set up and doesn\\u2019t require a lot of extra work on your end.\nHowever, for projects that require extremely sensitive data such as cryptography, a garbage collected language may not be the best choice because it leaves behind a trail of data that someone could potentially use to break the cryptography.
