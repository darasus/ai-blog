This means that the language is less likely to produce runtime errors, which is extremely important for system programming. For example, if you\\u2019re writing a cryptography implementation, you want to make sure that there aren\\u2019t any bugs that could lead to someone breaking the cryptography and seeing the contents of your data.\nThe focus on optimization means that Go is also relatively easy to scale up, which is another important factor for system programming.
