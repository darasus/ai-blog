Everything from your camera to the apps you use to chat with friends requires software code that\\u2019s specifically designed for the operating system and its particular hardware architecture. These operating systems are often called \\u201Csystem programming languages\\u201D because they have a singular focus on the underlying system rather than end user applications.\nIf you look at any list of popular programming languages, you\\u2019ll see that Go is pretty uncommon - especially as a primary language used by system programmers and developers. However, there\\u2019s also been a lot of talk recently about how Go has become an excellent choice for projects that require intensive performance and tight memory usage.

This means that the language is less likely to produce runtime errors, which is extremely important for system programming. For example, if you\\u2019re writing a cryptography implementation, you want to make sure that there aren\\u2019t any bugs that could lead to someone breaking the cryptography and seeing the contents of your data.\nThe focus on optimization means that Go is also relatively easy to scale up, which is another important factor for system programming. You may need to optimize your software to run on a large server or scale it up to support thousands of users.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Memory Management Is Key For System Programming\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Memory management is one of the most important aspects of system programming, and highlights why Go is a good fit for such projects.\nGo is a garbage collected language, which means that it will automatically reclaim the memory that your software is not actively using.\nDepending on the project, you may need to use a specific memory management technology to handle sensitive data. For example, if you\\u2019re writing a cryptography implementation, you\\u2019ll want to make sure that you\\u2019re using a memory management technology that doesn\\u2019t leave behind a trail of data that could be used to break your cryptography.\nFor many projects, Go\\u2019s garbage collection is a good fit because it\\u2019s easy to set up and doesn\\u2019t require a lot of extra work on your end.\nHowever, for projects that require extremely sensitive data such as cryptography, a garbage collected language may not be the best choice because it leaves behind a trail of data that someone could potentially use to break the cryptography. For example, Go\\u2019s garbage collection leaves behind traces that contain information about how long it took to process different parts of the code, which could be used to help break the cryptography.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go Has A Robust Package Management\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`One of the most important features of any programming language is its package management system.
