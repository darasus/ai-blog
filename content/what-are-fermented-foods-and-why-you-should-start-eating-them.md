Fermented foods are foods that have been through a process of fermentation. Fermentation is a process of allowing microorganisms to break down the carbohydrates in food. This process results in the production of lactic acid, which gives fermented foods their sour taste.

Fermented foods are rich in probiotics, which are live microorganisms that offer health benefits when consumed. Probiotics are thought to improve gut health by helping to maintain the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. They may also help to improve immune function and reduce inflammation.

There are many fermented foods available, including yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles. Fermented foods can be added to the diet by including them in meals or snacks, or by taking probiotic supplements.
