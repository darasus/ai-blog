## What are fermented foods?

Fermented foods are foods that have been through a fermentation process – a process which produces beneficial organic acids, such as lactic acid, that promote good health in humans. Perhaps the most well-known fermented foods are cultured dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir. Fermented vegetables, such as kimchi and sauerkraut, are also extremely common. Fermented food is a natural process that’s been happening since the beginning of time. It’s how people preserved food before fridges and freezers were invented. If you’ve ever left a piece of bread on a windowsill, it’s likely that you’ve also witnessed the fermentation process at work. When left in a warm, moist environment, bread naturally ferments, with the help of bacteria.

Fermented food has been eaten for thousands of years, and it’s a staple in many cultures. Traditional fermented foods include miso, tempeh, natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, kefir, apple cider vinegar, and pickles. Note that not all traditional fermented foods are created equally; they may differ in their nutrient content and processing. The fermentation process has been linked to positive health outcomes thanks to the production of organic acids. And fermentation isn’t just a great way to preserve food – it also increases the amount of nutrients in the food, making it more nutritious and easier for your body to absorb.

## Why are fermented foods so good for us?

Fermented foods are incredibly good for us because they’re rich in probiotics. Probiotics are friendly bacteria that live in our digestive systems and help to keep us healthy by promoting a healthy gut environment. As fermented foods are rich in probiotics, they can improve your digestive health, boost your immune system and help to regulate your blood sugar levels. If you’re struggling with any of these conditions, eating more fermented food may help to ease your symptoms. Many people also believe that fermented foods can help with weight loss, as they can reduce your appetite and help you to feel fuller for longer. Fermented foods are also rich in vitamin B, which can help to boost your mood. As fermented foods are also rich in vitamin C, they can boost your immunity and protect you from illnesses like the common cold and flu. Fermented vegetables also contain calcium, which can help to strengthen your bones and prevent osteoporosis. Fermented foods also contain minerals, such as iron, magnesium and selenium, as well as beneficial amounts of dietary fibre. There’s also evidence that fermented foods could help to prevent cancer, as they have been shown to kill off cancer cells in vitro studies. 


## How to start eating more fermented foods

If you’re keen to start eating more fermented foods, there are plenty of options that are easy to incorporate into your diet. You can start by making sure that you’re consuming probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt, kefir and kombucha. Fermented vegetables are also a great choice, and they’re especially easy to incorporate into your diet if you’re a vegan or vegetarian. You can add fermented vegetables to salads, sandwiches or soups, or you can use them as toppings on pizza. You can also make your own fermented vegetables at home, which is much cheaper than buying them from supermarkets and comes with the added benefit of being able to control what goes into them. You can also try fermenting your own vegetables and fruits. If you’re new to the world of fermented foods, it might take a little while to get used to the taste. Fermented foods have a very distinct flavor, so it’s worth bearing in mind that you might not like them the first time that you try them. Just like with any other food, it can take a while to get used to a new taste.

Eating more fermented foods can help to improve your digestive health and immune system, regulate your blood sugar levels, and make it easier to lose weight. It can also help to reduce the risk of developing cancer. The best thing about fermented foods is that they’re easy to integrate into your diet.
