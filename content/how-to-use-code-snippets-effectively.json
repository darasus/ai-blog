There is a huge demand for coders right now, and it is only going to continue growing in the future. Some of the most successful people today got there because they mastered a coding language and used it to their advantage. Whether you are looking for a new career opportunity or something you can use on a personal level, learning to code is something that will not only expand your mind but also open up so many doors for you.\nCoding languages might seem intimidating at first glance, but once you get past the initial weirdness of reading something that seems like a foreign language, they are actually fairly straightforward. Even if you have no programming experience whatsoever, this article will give you all the information you need to begin your coder journey and find the perfect coding language for your needs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

What started as a niche skill used by software developers is now a marketable and relevant skill for almost every industry. It has become so ubiquitous that even the Department of Labor has highlighted coding as one of the fastest growing skills in demand.\nCoding is most commonly thought of as the ability to create websites, apps and software. However, there are actually many different types of coding. Computer programming (or coding) involves writing instructions for computers so they perform certain actions or functions. The type of coding you choose to learn may have different applications depending on your interests, career trajectory and personal strengths.
