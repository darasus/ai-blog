Java has always been at the forefront of new technology adoption, thanks to its portability, consistency across various implementations, and large codebase. If you think that Java is just good for business applications and websites, then you need to think again. With the advent of Java 8 and Android apps based on this version of the language, there is a renewed focus on mobile development using Java. This has led to several innovations in the area of embedded devices with IoT-enabled edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) based artificial intelligence systems.
