There are a lot of resources out there, but they can be overwhelming. Which ones are worth your time? How do you find the best ones? The coding space is constantly growing and changing. There are new tools, sites, and concepts popping up every day. Navigating this landscape as a beginner can be difficult.\nCoding is an in-demand skill that has been growing rapidly in demand over the last few years. More and more people want to learn how to code, but there isn\\u2019t always an easy resource for beginners looking to get started. With so many options out there, it can be difficult to know where to start learning the basics of coding.

An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so. Let us explore how we can leverage interfaces in our code to make it more modular, reusable, testable and readable.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
