  MacBooks are the best laptops in the world. They’re light, compact, and
  durable. You can use your MacBook for work, school, or play. You can also pair
  it with an Apple monitor for a dual-monitor setup. However, there is a
  downside to MacBooks: they’re not as powerful as Macbook Pros. 

  If you want to get more from your laptop — especially if you plan on using it for intensive tasks such as photo editing or video editing — you need a Macbook Pro. The difference between the two models isn’t large enough to be noticeable unless you really dig into their specs. The Macbook is better suited for casual users because of its lower price tag and reduced weight. But if you’re considering buying a new laptop anytime soon, read these 5 reasons why You Need A Macbook Pro instead of the standard one.

## Macbook Pro laptop is more powerful

We’ve established that you can’t really tell a difference between the two laptops on the surface. However, the Macbook Pro has a more powerful processor that allows it to run multiple tasks at once without slowing down. The standard processor on the Macbook is 2.2GHz, while the Macbook Pro has a 2.9Ghz processor. The Macbook Pro also has 16GB of RAM, while the Macbook has 8GB. More memory means less lag while you’re working, scrolling through your social media feeds, or playing games. The Macbook Pro has a more powerful graphics card as well. The standard model has an integrated Intel UHD Graphics card, while the Macbook Pro has a dedicated graphics card that’s 50% more powerful.

## Macbook Pro has a better screen

The standard Macbook has a 13-inch screen, while the Macbook Pro has a 15-inch screen. Larger screens are better for photo editing and other intensive tasks. You can also connect an external monitor to the Macbook Pro if you want to create a dual-monitor setup. The standard Macbook has a maximum screen resolution of 2560 x 1600, while the Macbook Pro has a screen resolution of 2880 x 1800. The Macbook Pro also has a Retina display, which means the pixels are so small that you can’t see them. This makes text easier to read, and images look more realistic. It also means that you can connect your laptop to a 4K-resolution monitor without experiencing any lag.

## Macbook Pro offers more storage space

Although you can also expand the amount of storage on the standard Macbook by using an external hard drive, the Macbook Pro has more internal storage space to begin with. The standard Macbook has 128GB of internal storage, while the Macbook Pro has 256GB of storage. If you’re a professional photographer, video editor, or graphic designer, you probably have a ton of files. The standard Macbook isn’t built for such intensive work, and you might run out of space quickly. If you have a Macbook Pro, you won’t have to worry about this as much. This is especially true if you’re using external hard drives to store your files.

## You can connect more devices to a Macbook Pro

The standard Macbook only has two USB ports, but the Macbook Pro has four. This gives you the option to connect more devices, such as a mouse, a monitor, and a printer. You can also connect devices such as an external hard drive to expand your storage capacity. And, of course, you can use all of these devices to charge your phone at the same time. The Macbook Pro has an SD card slot as well, so you can quickly transfer files and use your camera’s cards to store your images. It has an Ethernet port as well, so if you have a reliable Internet connection, you can plug in your laptop and work offline.

## The keyboard on a Macbook Pro is superior

The standard Macbook has a backlit keyboard, but the Macbook Pro has a brighter keyboard with a richer red colour. Both models have the same key travel distance and quiet sound, but the Macbook Pro has a more responsive feeling. This is due to its slightly better design. The keyboard on the Macbook Pro is also non-waterproof, but it’s sturdier and less likely to break.

## Summary

The Macbook Pro is a better choice for power users who need a laptop for intensive tasks, such as photo editing or video editing. It has a more powerful processor and graphics card, a brighter keyboard, and a larger screen. The standard Macbook is better suited for casual users who want a lightweight laptop with a lower price tag.

If you want to get more from your laptop, especially if you plan on using it for intensive tasks such as photo editing or video editing, you need a Macbook Pro. The difference between the two models isn’t large enough to be noticeable unless you really dig into their specs.
