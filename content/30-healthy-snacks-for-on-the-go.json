Unfortunately, those decisions too often lead to less than healthy snack options like potato chips or sweets. However, there are plenty of great ways to get your recommended daily intake of fruits and veggies even when you\\u2019re on the go. These 30 healthy snacks for on-the-go are perfect for keeping in your purse, desk drawer, locker, or anywhere else you might find yourself hungry and without access to a full meal.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
