intro: >-
  Have you ever sat and wondered how much influence a single photo can
  have? The answer is: quite a lot. A single photograph has the power to change
  opinions, shape perceptions, and even alter the course of history. 

  Let’s take for example, the most iconic cat photos of all time; whether you love them or hate them, their fame cannot be denied. These are images that have been shared on social media sites and printed on t-shirts and posters across the globe. And we think they’re pretty iconic!

  Any cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there’s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.

## With that being said, we wanted to take a moment today to pay homage to the kitty-world by taking a look back at some of the most iconic cat photos in history.

## Meet Smashing, The Photo Shaking Cat

We kick off the list with this classic image of the famous Smashing photographer, Yves St. Laurent. This feline photo-bomb has been making a splash for decades, and is still shared on social media today. It’s amazing how a simple photo can loom so large in the minds of so many!

## A Small Step For Man…But A Giant Leap For Cats

This image, which was taken aboard the USS Hornet ship during the launch of the Gemini 2 mission, has been the subject of wild speculation and conspiracy theories since it was first published in 1972. While it is now widely accepted that the photographer was taking a picture of his shipmate in a spacesuit, many have suggested that the suited figure is actually a cat. Why? Well, it’s probably because the cat is more popular than the spacesuit! It’s a great photograph, and it has left a lasting impression on the world.

## Will The Real Mr. Bigglesworth Please Stand Up?

This photo, which was taken outside the home of the actor John Cleese, is often accompanied by a caption asking the reader to guess the name of the famous feline depicted in the photo. It’s a great photo, and it features Mr. Bigglesworth, the feline companion of the iconic cartoon cat, Garfield. In fact, the photograph was taken during a time when Mr. Bigglesworth was still a kitten.

## When Puss N’ Boots Took Over The World

This whimsical black-and-white image may look like it was taken from the pages of a children’s book, but it was actually taken during the production of the first ever James Bond film, Dr. No. The photograph shows a stray tomcat named Tinker who was brought on set as a companion for Sean Connery’s Bond character. While the cat’s fur was shaved off so that he could be painted with blue paint to resemble a black panther, Puss N’ Boots went on to leave a very paw-print on the world!

## Think Pink: Kitty Shakes Its Tail Feathers In Celebration

This iconic photograph is often used as a symbol for the LGBTQI community, and it was taken during a celebration held in San Francisco’s Castro district after the announcement that the AIDS virus could not be spread through casual contact. It’s a fantastic image that has been reprinted on posters and T-shirts around the world. It’s definitely a great example of how a single photograph can be used to make a statement.

## Garfield Is Everywhere (and That’s A Good Thing)

This image depicts the moment when the cartoon character Garfield’s eyes were first drawn. While the photo is nothing more than a scribbled outline of a cat’s face, it is still one of the most famous cat photos in history. We love Garfield as much as anyone, but this photograph does raise an interesting point. Cats are such mysterious creatures that a photograph of a scribble can become an iconic image!

## Kitten On Fire: You Can Never Forget Your First Burn

This image has been shared across the internet many times over, and for good reason. It shows a kitten who is blissfully unaware of the smoke surrounding him as he lies on a piece of smoldering fabric. While it is cute to look at this kitten, it is important to remember that the fabric could cause severe burns. Many have been inspired to learn first aid techniques as a result of this photo.

## Meow-chy Baby: Hello Kitty Grows Up

This image shows the iconic Hello Kitty with a newly mature appearance. It was taken at a special Hello Kitty event in Japan that featured many of the franchise’s characters as they appeared in the past, present, and future. It’s a huge photo that shows the power of Hello Kitty, and it goes to show that a single image can have a massive impact on the world!
