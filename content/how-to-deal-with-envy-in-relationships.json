From concerns over online safety to the amount of time kids spend looking at screens, digital parenting presents its own unique set of challenges.\nAs technology continues to advance, so do the ways in which our kids can interact with it. From tablets and smart TVs to smartphones and video games, it seems as though there are more screens than ever before. This is especially true for younger children who have grown up with these devices as a normal part of their everyday life.\nThe pros and cons of screen time for kids can be debated endlessly but at the end of the day, your child will likely spend a lot of their time consuming some form of media in one way or another. As their parent, it\\u2019s important that you understand the benefits and risks associated with screen time so that you can make informed decisions about how much exposure they receive on a regular basis.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But it also brings its fair share of stressors, from spending time with extended relatives that you only see once a year to buying gifts for all those people and throwing together an elaborate party that your guests will talk about for years to come.\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to make the season less stressful. Stress is a natural response when we feel like our safety is threatened or our personal space has been invaded. When it comes to the holiday season, however, just about everything invokes stress as a response.
