  Unless you’re independently wealthy or have an unlimited supply of
  personal financial resources, funding is one of the biggest obstacles for
  founders launching a startup. How do you find money to fund your startup when
  banks and financial institutions are so risk-averse? Thankfully, there are
  several different funding sources available to entrepreneurs that are looking
  to get their ventures off the ground. 

  However, finding the right type of funding for your startup – and in the appropriate amount – can be tricky. There are many things to consider before committing equity to someone else’s idea or launching a crowdfunding campaign. Making the right decision upfront can make all the difference later on, which is why we’ve outlined some helpful information on how to get funding for your startup.

## What Is the Right Way to Get Funding for a Startup?

If you’re a startup founder looking to get funding, you’ll need to find the right investor or funding source. The ideal funding type will depend on the type of business you’re starting, your growth strategy, the amount of funding you’ll need, and your exit strategy.

For example, if you’re launching an ecommerce business, you might want to find investors who are experienced with retail businesses. On the other hand, if you’re starting an augmented reality company, you’ll want to find investors who specialize in AR startups.

You should also take a look at the success rate of each investor. There are several ways to find the right funding for your startup.

First, you can ask friends, family, and other people you know for investment. While not everyone will be able to put money into your company, this is a great way to get started.

Next, you can get in touch with angel investors and venture capital firms. You can find these investors by attending industry events, joining startup groups, and pitching your business through online platforms.

## Angel Investors

Angel investors provide seed funding to startup founders in exchange for a percentage of the company’s equity. These types of investors typically invest between $100,000 and $1 million in early-stage companies. Investors will usually look to make a profit by selling their stake in the company at a higher price at a future time.

Angel investors are typically experienced business owners and investors who are interested in helping young companies get off the ground. In return for their investment, you’ll have to give them a chunk of the company’s equity. This will make it more difficult to sell your company later on, but it can help you bridge the funding gap in the short term.

## VCs and Venture Capital

Venture capital firms invest in startups for the long term, meaning they fund companies that aim to bring in revenue over the next three to five years. Venture capital firms are actively investing in startups in order to resell their equity at a higher price in the future. As they’re looking to make a big profit, they’re more likely to fund high-growth startups.

To get funding from a venture capitalist, you’ll need to pitch your business plan and show that you have what it takes to succeed and grow. You’ll likely have to provide the venture capitalist with a part of your company’s equity in return for funding. Once you’ve built up your business, you can sell your company and pay off the venture capitalist.

## Co-Founder Fundings

If you have a co-founder, you can approach potential investors by offering them to take a stake in your co-founder’s stake. This way, the investor gets a percentage of your company’s equity without having to take a slice out of your pie. There are two different ways to go about this. You can either give the investor a convertible note or issue them a warrant. A convertible note is a loan that converts into equity once your company generates a certain amount of revenue. A warrant is an agreement that gives the investor the option to buy a specific amount of equity at a fixed price.

Co-founder fundings are great because they don’t cost you any equity. However, you’ll have to pay the investor a certain amount of money. Make sure to find an investor who is interested in your company’s success and has a good track record.

## Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is when you launch a startup without any external funding. You can try launching your business without outside investment by using your own money, getting a personal loan, and reducing your expenses as much as possible. This is a great option for people who want to keep their ownership of the company high. However, it’s important to keep in mind that it will take a long time to build a profitable business without outside assistance.

The best way to bootstrap your startup is by creating a low-cost business model. Focus on creating a product or service that doesn’t require a large amount of funding to get off the ground and is easy to scale.

To reduce expenses, try living below your means and cutting back on unnecessary expenses. You can also try crowdfunding to see if your business has enough support to get off the ground.

## Crowdfunding Platforms

If you’ve run out of options and don’t have the funds to get your business off the ground, you can try crowdfunding. Crowdfunding platforms let individuals donate money to different campaigns. You can try raising money for your startup by creating a crowdfunding campaign.

Before you launch a campaign, make sure to create a clear funding goal and write an interesting pitch that is relevant to your audience. Hosting your campaign on a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo will cost you a certain percentage of the funds you raise. However, this might be your best bet if you don’t have the cash to get your business going.

## Summing up

Getting funding for your startup is no easy task. You’ll have to pitch your business idea to investors, find the right type of funding, and pitch your company in a way that makes it attractive to investors. Before you do this, you’ll want to make sure that your business is ready to receive funding. This means that you’ve built a solid business plan, found the right type of funding, and pitched your company in a compelling way.
