Or perhaps you just don\\u2019t want your dog jumping up on people. Whatever the case, teaching your dog to not jump up on people is an essential skill.

Will they creep towards you first or wait for you to move closer first? The answer may be different every time and that\\u2019s why it can feel like a constant guessing game. However, with persistence and patience, you can train your dog to not jump on people.\nIf your dog is prone to jumping, it\\u2019s important to manage that behavior before moving onto this training program. Dogs commonly jump for one of three reasons: They are excited and overstimulated; they want something from you such as food or attention; or they see it as a way of getting nearer to something else (this could be either the person you don\\u2019t want them leaping at or something else nearby).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019t also less expensive than going to court and doesn\\u2019t give your opponent any negative information that could be used against you in the future. The only potential drawback to mediation is that it requires both parties to agree on an outcome they are happy with. If one party feels like they have no other options, they may not be willing to mediate. However, this should not stop you from exploring this option further.\nMediation has many benefits over other methods of dispute resolution, such as negotiation and arbitration. However, every type of settlement has its drawbacks. Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of mediation as a dispute resolution technique:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It is a process that brings people together to resolve conflict and find mutually satisfying solutions. In mediation, an impartial third party assists the disputing parties in identifying the issues, exploring their own role in it and accessing their core needs to come up with a solution that works for all parties involved.\nMediation is a confidential process and there are many types of mediation depending on the nature of conflict. For example, dispute resolution could be focusing on specific issues such as environmental concerns or human resources issues; it could be between two parties such as divorce mediation or landlord-tenant mediation; it could be on a particular topic like civil rights mediation or criminal mediation; or it could be based on certain factors like age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability.
