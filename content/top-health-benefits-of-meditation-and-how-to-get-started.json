This helps to train your brain to be less reactive and more in control of your emotions.\nMeditation has also been proven to increase your levels of serotonin and GABA, two chemicals in the brain that are associated with feeling calm and relaxed.

You may also find that you are able to fall asleep faster than before and are less likely to wake up during the night.\nWhen you meditate, you actively bring your mind and body into balance.
