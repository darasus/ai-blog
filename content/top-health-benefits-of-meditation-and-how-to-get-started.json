This helps to train your brain to be less reactive and more in control of your emotions.\nMeditation has also been proven to increase your levels of serotonin and GABA, two chemicals in the brain that are associated with feeling calm and relaxed.

You may also find that you are able to fall asleep faster than before and are less likely to wake up during the night.\nWhen you meditate, you actively bring your mind and body into balance.

By reducing your levels of cortisol, as well as increasing your levels of oxytocin (a \\u201Clove hormone\\u201D), you will be better equipped to handle stress and its negative effects on your immune system.\nMeditation can also help you to get more sleep, which is another important factor when it comes to boosting your immune system.
