Meditation has been proven to be as effective as medication when it comes to reducing stress and anxiety. This is especially true for people who have had anxiety disorders in the past, as meditation has been found to be even more effective than medication for these individuals.\nWhen you meditate, you actively practice being present in the moment and letting go of negative thoughts and feelings. This helps to train your brain to be less reactive and more in control of your emotions.\nMeditation has also been proven to increase your levels of serotonin and GABA, two chemicals in the brain that are associated with feeling calm and relaxed. When your brain is flooded with these chemicals, they will help to reduce anxiety and stress, as well as increase your ability to fall and stay asleep.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Improve Focus And Concentration\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`If you\\u2019re looking to improve your focus and concentration, then meditation is the perfect choice for you.

As you continue to practice this ancient art, your ability to focus will continue to increase.\nMeditation has been proven to increase activity in the areas of the brain associated with focus and attention. It can also reduce activity in the areas of the brain linked to distractions and self-criticism. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience found that after just eight hours of meditation, participants experienced a decrease in the activity of the \\u201Cdefault mode network\\u201D (DMN). This network is linked to daydreaming, being distracted and self-criticism.\nAnd while it might sound clich\\xE9, meditation has also been proven to improve your attention span.

This is the hormone that is released when you experience stress and anxiety. High levels of cortisol can prevent the brain from producing enough melatonin, the hormone that regulates your sleep cycle. As a result, you may experience poor sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep.\nMeditation actively works to lower your cortisol levels and as a result, you will experience better sleep quality. You may also find that you are able to fall asleep faster than before and are less likely to wake up during the night.\nWhen you meditate, you actively bring your mind and body into balance.

One study found that after just eight weekly meditation sessions, participants experienced a greater than 400 percent increase in levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA is an antibody found in saliva and tears that has been proven to be an effective way to fight off colds and the flu.\nMeditation has also been proven to help you cope with stress, which is one of the biggest contributors to lowered immunity. By reducing your levels of cortisol, as well as increasing your levels of oxytocin (a \\u201Clove hormone\\u201D), you will be better equipped to handle stress and its negative effects on your immune system.\nMeditation can also help you to get more sleep, which is another important factor when it comes to boosting your immune system. Getting enough sleep at least seven hours each night has been proven to help your body fight off illness.

When you meditate, you actively work to let go of negative thoughts and feelings, and focus instead on being present in the moment. This will help to lower your stress levels and make you healthier as a result.\nMeditation can also help you to sleep better, which can also reduce your blood pressure.
