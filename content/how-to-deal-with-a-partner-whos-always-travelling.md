summary: You have to be able to talk honestly and openly with your partner.
  Communication is important when dating someone who travels frequently. Don’t
  assume the worst about your partner, but it only leads to trouble. Ask your
  partner what makes them feel loved while they’re away. Plan discreet dates in
  a way that both of you can be discreet about it. Only a very small number of
  people in long-distance relationships cheat on their partners. If you want to
  make it work, you have to accept that it will be a big part of their life.
intro: >-
  Do you long for the days when your partner would snuggle up next to you
  and watch Netflix instead of travelling for work? If you’re dating someone who
  travels frequently, those days might be over. But don’t worry — it’s not over
  forever. These types of relationships are special in their own way. 

  We all have different priorities in a relationship, but sometimes those differences can put strain on your partnership. When one partner is always traveling for work, there will be some challenges. You have to figure out ways to keep the romance alive, even in difficult circumstances. 

  There are many things you should know about being with someone who travels a lot for work. Here are some tips to help you get past the difficulties and stay positive about your relationship as a whole.

## Communicate Often

One of the most important things when dating someone who frequently travels is communication. You have to be able to talk honestly and openly with your partner — otherwise, you’ll have no idea how they feel or what they need from you.

If you’re not comfortable having these types of conversations with your partner, you might be in for a difficult time. It can be tempting to avoid talking about the issue entirely, but it’s ultimately the best way to make things more difficult.

Communicate how you feel about their travel and ask how they feel about it. You might be surprised to find that your partner has been feeling just as frustrated as you have about it.

## Focus On What You Have, Not What You Don’t

When you’re in a committed relationship, it’s easy to get caught up in what you don’t have. You might think about how your partner isn’t around to do things with you or how you don’t get to spend as much time with them as you’d like.
When you start to focus on what you don’t have, it can make you feel a lot of resentment towards your partner. It can be easy to blame your partner for being gone so often, but it only leads to trouble.
Instead of dwelling on what you don’t have, focus on what you do have. Think about the good times you’ve had with your partner or the things that make your relationship strong. You might even want to write down a list of gratitude to help you focus on what you do have.

## Plan Discreet Dates

When you’re dating someone who travels often, you don’t get to spend as much time with them as you’d like. It can be hard to feel like you have time to get to know each other properly, let alone have any kind of romance.
If you want to keep your relationship strong through those periods of time when you don’t get to see each other, you have to plan discreet dates. Make sure you plan them in a way that both of you can be discreet about it. Otherwise, your partner might get teased by their coworkers.

## Don’t Assume The Worst

For some people, dating someone who travels frequently will feel like you’re always waiting for them to leave. You might think that your partner is always on the verge of leaving you for another job — or for another person.
Don’t assume the worst about your partner. Only a very small number of people in long-distance relationships cheat on their partners.
It’s important to keep in mind that your partner isn’t leaving you for someone else. They’re just trying to make a living for both of you.

## Ask Your Partner What Makes Them Feel Loved

You know your partner better than anyone else. But you also need to remember that your partner knows you better than anyone else, too. If you’re wondering how to make your partner feel loved while they’re away, ask them.
Try to put yourself in your partner’s shoes. Think about what they might need from you while they’re away that you could provide.
If you want to make your partner feel loved while they’re away, you have to ask them what they need.

## Bottom Line

There are some challenges to dating someone who travels frequently. They’re usually far outweighed by the benefits of being with them, though.
If you want to be with someone who travels for work, you have to be willing to accept that it will be a big part of their life. You can’t expect your partner to completely stop travelling just because you want them to.
If you can accept that, you can find a way to make it work and have a stronger, more meaningful relationship when your partner comes home.
