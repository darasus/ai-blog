summary: Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn and is used
  in many industries. Python is a very flexible programming language that means
  that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what
  you want it to do. Because Python is used to write code for many industries,
  it means that there are many different job opportunities for you when you
  graduate. Python developers love to hire Python developers when they need to
  hire someone new. It has great potential to work in finance, healthcare,
  technology, education, and science.
intro: >-
  So you want to get into programming but you aren’t sure where to start.
  You know that there are many different programming languages out there and
  that they can be used for different things, but which one is the best one to
  learn first? Well, you might be surprised to learn that it’s Python. Why?
  Because it’s the language of tomorrow. 

  Now you might be thinking: Why does that make it the language of tomorrow? After all, shouldn’t we be focusing on learning languages like COBOL that will help us in our future career as an accountant or something like that? Well… perhaps. But maybe not so much. See, while those other programming languages are great for some things, they aren’t so great for others. And when we take a look at what other programming languages won’t be able to do in the future because of their limitations (or maybe just their age), we see why programmers today are saying that Python is going to be the dominant language of tomorrow. Let’s dive into why by taking a look at several reasons why Python is a fantastic first programming language to learn today!

## Python Is Easy To Learn

If you are brand new to programming and don’t know how difficult it can be to grasp the concepts behind it. But the truth is, programming can be tough and many people who try to learn how to code give up because it’s too hard to understand. You see, the most important thing to look for in a programming language if you are just getting started is that it needs to be easy to learn. If it isn’t, you risk getting frustrated and quitting before you even get started.
But luckily for Python beginners, Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn. In fact, it’s been used in many high school and college classrooms for ages as the go-to language for people learning to code for the first time because it makes the concepts of programming easy to grasp for beginners.

## It’s Used In Many Industries

One of the best things about Python is that it’s used in many industries. Why is this important? Well, if you were to learn a programming language like C or C++, you would only be able to use it to write code for certain industries. For example, if you wanted to get a job as a C++ developer, you could only work in the gaming industry. But if you learn Python, you can use it to write code for many different industries like: Finance, healthcare, technology, education, and science.
Because Python is used to write code for many industries, it means that there are many different job opportunities for you when you graduate. You might be thinking: If it’s used for so many industries, why isn’t it being used for more industries? Well, that leads us to our next reason why Python is the best programming language to learn today.

## It Has Great Hiring Potential

As we just mentioned, Python is used in many industries and is a programming language that is easy to learn. But there is another reason why hiring managers love to hire Python developers when they need to hire someone new. The reason is because Python is a very flexible programming language. What that means is that the code you write in Python is very easy to modify and adjust to do what you want it to do.
This means that you can use the same code in your project to do many different things. For example, let’s say you are working on a project that uses a website interface to order food to be delivered to your home. You can use the same code you write to do that in your project to then write code to program a self-driving car. It
