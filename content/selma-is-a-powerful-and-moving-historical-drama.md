intro: "It’s been more than a century since the fight for voting rights was so
  prominent in American society. Films like “Selma” are necessary to remind
  viewers of this period in our history and the crucial role that certain people
  played in ensuring voting rights are protected. Before many others, Dr. Martin
  Luther King, Jr., along with other civil rights leaders, attempted to register
  African-Americans to vote in Selma, Alabama. It was here where police
  brutality and attacks on protesters were prevalent and where media attention
  centered around televised trials of two men accused of murdering local Black
  residents. The town was also home to Selma’s most famous resident at the time:
  Collin W. Lewis, also known as “the Lion of Selma” – a prominent civil rights
  leader who had grown up there after his family fled Greenwood as part of the
  Great Migration from 1916-1921. In 1965, Lewis recruited Dr. King to come
  speak at Selma High School about voting rights. It was here where their
  partnership began and culminated in the historic march across the Edmund
  Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965 – known today as Bloody Sunday because those
  marching were violently attacked by law enforcement officers (including tear
  gas, billy clubs, and bull whips), leaving many injured and 26 hospitalized

## Synopsis

After Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is arrested in Selma, Alabama for marching without a permit, activists begin being arrested and fined for organizing and protesting at the local courthouse. King’s organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, organizes a march from Selma to the capital of Montgomery to demand voting rights for African-Americans. The march begins on February 7th, 1965 with just a handful of people and grows to over a thousand within a week. On February 17, the marchers arrive in Montgomery and the following day the State of Alabama agrees to comply with the National Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits discrimination at the polls.

## The Film’s Characters

- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. - The leader of the march, civil rights activist and Baptist minister Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a man on a mission. Having already been arrested several times, Dr. King is determined to march 50 miles across Alabama to the state’s capital, Montgomery. Dr. King’s goal is to secure the right to vote for all African-Americans – a right that was guaranteed by the 15th Amendment but often unfulfilled.
- Collin W. Lewis - The Lion of Selma was a civil rights leader whose reputation was well-known throughout the state. Lewis was also a member of the NAACP and helped organize the first voter registration drives in Selma. His most famous speech, “To Crush the Serpent’s Head,” was given at Friendship Baptist Church in Selma. Lewis was also the one who invited Dr. King to Selma to speak at Selma High School, where the two men met.
- Sheriff Jim Clark - Selma’s white sheriff who arrests Dr. King for marching without a permit, is known for his violent mistreatment of protesters and his hatred of the civil rights movement.
- George Wallace - The governor of Alabama who orders law enforcement to prevent the marchers from reaching Montgomery. Wallace also interrupts a speech given by Dr. King in order to mock him.
- Viola Liuzzo - A White woman who traveled from Detroit to Selma to participate in the march. Liuzzo was shot and killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan while transporting marchers.
- Unnamed Men and Women - Activists who were brutally beaten and/or arrested while marching and/or organizing protests in Selma.

## Positive Elements

Civil rights films are important because they allow viewers to witness how not so long ago, people of color in the U.S. weren’t able to enjoy basic civil rights and were often treated as less than human. While films like “Selma” are devastating to watch, they’re important because they remind viewers of where we’ve been and where we need to go. In “Selma,” we witness brutal police brutality, the sexual assault of a female protester and her subsequent shaming, and the abuse of power. Instead of denying the events that took place at Selma, the film invites viewers to confront them and grapple with the dark periods of our history.

## Recommendation

“Selma” is a powerful and moving historical drama that is as relevant today as it was in the 1960s. The film highlights the importance of standing up for what you believe in and fighting for equality. It’s clear that the film’s director, Ava DuVernay, has a deep respect and admiration for the African-American activists who paved the way for future generations. The film is recommended for viewers 13 years and older due to scenes of violence (including brutal police mistreatment, assault, and sexual assault) and some sexual content (including a scene where a protester is groped by a law enforcement officer). “Selma” will leave viewers feeling hopeful and inspired. It’s a must-see for all.

## Warning: Contains Violence and Discussions of Police Brutality and Sexual Assault

Depending on your child’s level of maturity and ability to understand what’s happening in the film, “Selma” may be too dark for some viewers. The film does not shy away from depicting the brutal treatment of Selma’s Black residents at the hands of the police or the Ku Klux Klan. The film also discusses sexual assault and may be too mature for viewers who are under the age of 13.
