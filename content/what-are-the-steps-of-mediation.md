summary: The parties can discuss the issues and concerns they have with each
  other, and the mediator can help guide the discussion and suggest ways the two
  sides might be able to settle on amicable terms that are mutually beneficial.
  Mediation sessions usually take place in a neutral location such as a
  mediation center. The mediator will then work with each party to structure the
  mediation session(s) in a way that helps both sides work together productively
  to reach an agreement. At the end of the session, the parties will usually
  agree on a written mediation agreement that will usually help the parties work
  together.
intro: >-
  Mediation is a type of alternative dispute resolution that utilizes a
  neutral third party to help parties in a conflict reach an agreement. These
  agreements are known as mediation agreements, and they are not legally
  binding. However, if the parties choose to enter into such an agreement, it
  can help them move past their differences and work together constructively
  going forward.

  Mediation is very different from other forms of ADR because there is no neutral third party adjudicator present during mediation sessions. Rather, both parties agree to let a neutral mediator facilitate their discussion and suggest ways the two sides might be able to settle on amicable terms that are mutually beneficial.

  Furthermore, unlike arbitration, which uses a third party neutral arbitrator to resolve disputes privately with no input from either party, with mediation thereâ€™s no need for secret proceedings or winner take all outcomes. Instead, both sides come together in order to find the best possible outcome for everyone involved by working through issues towards an agreeable solution that works for everyone.
