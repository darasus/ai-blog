Mediation is a process where two parties in conflict meet with a neutral third party, the mediator, to try to resolve their differences. The mediator helps the parties to communicate with each other and to explore options for resolving their dispute. Mediation is a voluntary process and can only take place if both parties agree to participate.

The first step in mediation is for the parties to meet with the mediator. The mediator will explain the mediation process and answer any questions the parties have. The mediator will also help the parties to identify the issues in dispute and the interests of each party.

The second step is for the parties to start communicating with each other. The mediator will help the parties to share information and to understand each other's point of view. The mediator will also help the parties to brainstorm options for resolving their dispute.

The third step is for the parties to reach an agreement. The mediator will help the parties to negotiate an agreement that is acceptable to both sides. Once an agreement is reached, the mediator will prepare a written agreement for the parties to sign.
