We will cover the fundamentals of setting up a project, creating tables and handling user logins.\nWe have all probably heard of SQL databases before. They are used to store data in tables so that you can query the data efficiently. Each table has columns with the properties of that entity stored as values in those columns.\nHowever, building an entire database from scratch is not something that most developers would want to do on a daily basis. This is where Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries come in useful. Instead of dealing directly with SQL tables and their contents, you can use these libraries to represent your domain objects as entities in their own right.

In this post, we will explain what JavaFX is and what it brings to the table. We will also see some examples of where this technology is being used. If you\\u2019re interested in learning more about its benefits and implementation details, keep reading!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This makes JSF a framework that uses XML markup instead of code for building and rendering user interfaces.\nA JavaServer Faces application basically is a collection of a views, managed by a controller, stored in an archive file and deployed on a servlet container. Such applications are known as \\u201Cheavyweight\\u201D because there are many different pieces involved to build it.\nAs we know, JavaServer Faces technology comes with several built-in tag libraries and default libraries such as standard action message, navigation rule, focus handler, and so on. Each library offers handlers or actions that enable you to use different components in your application. These components can be combined in any way you want to meet your specific requirements.\nIn this article we will go over what you need to get started creating a new JavaServer Faces application project in IntelliJ IDEA`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
