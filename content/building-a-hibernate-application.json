It was originally developed at Google to solve some of the problems with other programming languages like C and Python that made it difficult to write programs that are fast, small, and correct.\nGo makes it easy to capture the programmer\\u2019s intent in code and generate output directly from source - thanks to its lightweight syntax, concise statement, and built-in support for anonymous functions without the need for temporary variables or auxiliary arguments.\nGo is generally regarded as a modern programming language, which means that it has been designed with performance in mind, comes with support for concurrency, and implements new features introduced by other recent programming languages like Rust and Swift. The factors listed above make Go an excellent choice for software development projects involving medium-to-large sized codebases, performance optimization, or writing compilers.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

For example, an exception could be something like reading from an empty string variable, trying to access the sixth element of an array with only five elements, or even something as simple as not having enough memory available to continue executing instructions.\nThese exceptional circumstances are called exceptions because they are exceptional and the program handler cannot proceed with its usual execution path any further. To the user, it appears as if the application has \\u201Cexceptionally\\u201D failed in some way and needs to recover from this state.
