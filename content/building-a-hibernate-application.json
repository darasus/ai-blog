It can be used in any type of application, but is particularly appealing to developers who use a Java-based programming language. The logic to retrieve data from a database is built into the library.

We will cover the fundamentals of setting up a project, creating tables and handling user logins.\nWe have all probably heard of SQL databases before. They are used to store data in tables so that you can query the data efficiently. Each table has columns with the properties of that entity stored as values in those columns.\nHowever, building an entire database from scratch is not something that most developers would want to do on a daily basis. This is where Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries come in useful. Instead of dealing directly with SQL tables and their contents, you can use these libraries to represent your domain objects as entities in their own right. Once you\\u2019ve done that, it becomes much easier to persist them into your database without writing any SQL statements yourself!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
