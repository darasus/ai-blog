It won\\u2019t come easily at first, but with time and the right amount of dedication, anyone can learn the fundamentals of coding whether they have prior knowledge or not.\nCoding is becoming one of the most important skills in today\\u2019s job market. Even if you don\\u2019t want to become a software engineer or the like, understanding basic coding principles can give you an edge in almost any other field. You see, anything from accounting to healthcare uses technology on a daily basis \\u2014 often involving advanced software or artificial intelligence systems.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
