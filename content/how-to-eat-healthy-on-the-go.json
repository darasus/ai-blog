Here are some ideas that may help make eating healthy snacks more exciting for your child.\nThere\\u2019s nothing like the love and trust of a child to make you reassess everything you do as a parent, and unfortunately most of us have let our kids down when it comes to feeding them in a way that benefits their health. It is not easy raising healthy kids when almost everywhere we look there are temptations around every corner trying their best to get us to buy something else instead.\nThe good news is that this is not an impossible task. With the right balance of encouragement, support, and guidance from trusted parenting sources, we can all help our kids grow up with healthier habits than we currently have as adults.

Super cool, right? Well, sort of. If you\\u2019re like most adults and teens, you probably don\\u2019t have time to pack your own lunch every day. Instead, many of us rely on fast food or convenience stores for our midday meal. While this can be an affordable and convenient option, these places often offer unhealthy food loaded with salt and fat.\nFortunately, there are more healthy options out there than you might think. These days there are many drive-through restaurants that serve much healthier versions of the standard fast food menu items. Cafeterias in offices, schools, libraries and other public places also tend to offer healthy choices as well as salad bars and other stations where you can make your own healthy salads or sandwiches.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
