Famous celebrities, athletes and even foodies are swearing off meat and animal products to lead a more plant-based life.\nThis practice is also known as \\u201Cveganism\\u201D or an \\u201Cethical vegan\\u201D diet. In addition to eating plants for most of your calories, a plant-based diet eliminates or reduces your consumption of animal products like meat, eggs, dairy and honey.\nThe reasons for going plant-based are as varied as the people who do it. Some people feel that this diet is the best way to reduce their carbon footprint and live in harmony with nature. Others see it as a healthier alternative to the Standard American Diet (SAD).\nMany simply like the taste of plants more than meat. Whatever your reason for trying a plant- A great first step is learning how to start with these tips!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
