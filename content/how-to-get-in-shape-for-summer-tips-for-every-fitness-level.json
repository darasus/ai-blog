If you have any serious injuries, chronic health conditions, or other physical limitations, this can make it even harder to find fitness options that work for you. Before you even start planning your fitness routine, make sure you understand your physical limitations.\nFor example, if you tend to experience knee pain when running, you\\u2019ll want to look for other cardio options that don\\u2019t put as much stress on your knees.
