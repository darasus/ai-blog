summary: Coding is the process of creating a set of instructions for a computer
  to follow. This is typically done with a computer programming language like
  Python, Java, or Ruby. It teaches your child to think critically, solve
  problems, and break down complex ideas into simpler, more manageable parts.
  The number of people interested in learning to code rising every year, coding
  is quickly becoming a marketable skill. It is an excellent skill to introduce
  your child at an early age. It challenges your child’s creative ideas and
  forces them to break down their ideas.
intro: >-
  Are you looking for a way to develop your child’s critical thinking
  skills? Do you want to expose your child to STEM-related fields without
  sacrificing their creativity and imagination? If so, coding might be the
  perfect opportunity for both of you.

  Coding is an excellent skill to introduce your child to at an early age. It challenges them creatively and forces them to think critically. Additionally, it opens up a multitude of potential career opportunities in some of the fastest-growing fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.

  Coding falls within the scope of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) because it involves working with codes or sets of instructions that computers can read and understand. 

  If you’re ready to learn more about how coding can help your kid grow as a person and as a future adult—as well as why it’s important for kids—read on!

## What Exactly Is Coding?

Coding is writing instructions for a computer to use. With coding, you can create all sorts of apps, websites, and programs, as well as control devices like robots. Coding is typically done with a computer programming language like Python, Java, or Ruby.
Coding is the process of creating a set of instructions for a computer to follow. This is typically done using a programming language like Python, Java, or Ruby.

## Why is Coding Important?

Coding is important because it teaches your child how to translate their creative ideas into real-world products. It also teaches your child to think critically, solve problems, and break down complex ideas into simpler, more manageable parts.
Coding is an essential skill in today’s ever-expanding digital landscape. Whether your child wants to design and create apps, write software for robotics, or even become a data analyst, learning to code will help them translate their ideas into reality. In other words, coding makes your child’s ideas come to life.
Coding also teaches your child to think critically, solve problems, and break down complex ideas into simpler, more manageable parts. This is especially true when they’re first learning to code, as they’ll have to break down their own ideas into a series of instructions that a computer can understand.

## 3 Benefits of Introducing Your Child to Coding Early

- Improved Critical Thinking Skills - As we mentioned above, coding challenges your child’s critical thinking skills and forces them to break down their ideas. This is incredibly important as it helps your child become more thoughtful, empathetic, and successful throughout their lives.
- Marketable Skill - With the number of people interested in learning to code rising every year, coding is quickly becoming a marketable skill. If your child learns how to code when they’re young, they can use it to land a job when they’re older.
- Leg Up in the Job Market - The job market is competitive, and having a leg up on other job candidates can give your child the advantage they need to get their foot in the door. Coding is one of those skills that employers are actively searching for, making it a great way for your child to get noticed.

## How to Use Coding To Develop Creative Thinking

- Play Solved Code - Solved code is code that’s been written in order to solve a specific problem. Your child can do this alone or with friends, solving puzzles or challenges and then writing the code that solves the problem.
- Create a Coding Toolbox - You can help your child build creative thinking skills by building a child’s toolbox. This can include everything from a basic computer to simple coding kits and toys.
- Get Creative With Apps - Apps are a great way to get your child started with coding. Some apps are more basic than others, but they’re a great way to get your child thinking critically about code.

## Conclusion

As technology continues to evolve, so too does the need for qualified, knowledgeable programmers. This means that if your child learns to code when they’re young, they can use the skill practically throughout their entire lives.

Coding is an excellent skill to introduce your child to at an early age. It challenges them creatively and forces them to think critically. Additionally, it opens up a multitude of potential career opportunities in some of the fastest-growing fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.
