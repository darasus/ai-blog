Over the past decade, the S&P 500 index alone has created more than 200% value appreciation for its long-term investors. However, investing in the stock market is not as simple as buying stocks and forgetting about them for 10 or 20 years. It requires constant monitoring, research, and analysis to identify the right opportunities and manage risk. The Great Recession of 2007-08 is a perfect example of how risky investing can be. Many people who were new to investing suffered significant losses when their investments tanked during that time. If you\\u2019re thinking about investing your money in stocks, here are 10 things you need to know before doing so.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These are known as \"loads\" because they reduce your return. A no-load fund has no upfront or hidden costs. These mutual funds have a small initial investment requirement, which may be as little as $50.\nThese funds have other characteristics that make them different from those with load fees: No-load mutual funds generally don\\u2019t charge commissions or sales fees. They also don't offer special privileges for buying their stock, such as reserved shares or first dibs on new stocks coming public. There are no broker incentives like sales targets or bonus payments for selling certain shares.\nKeep reading to learn more about no-load mutual funds and whether they might be right for you.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
