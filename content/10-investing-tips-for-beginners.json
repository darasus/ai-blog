For many people, that means they never get started. But investing your money instead of just saving it can have a big impact on your financial future. In fact, time is the enemy of your money -- the sooner you begin investing for your future, the better off you\\u2019ll be.\nWorking with as little as $10 per month or an initial investment of $100 per month, you can begin to invest for your future. While it\\u2019s not necessarily easy to become a successful investor (it does take time and effort), there are simple things you can do to get started on the right foot with minimum risk.

But the opposite is true: you increase your risk of major losses. For example, if you invest all of your money in one company\\u2019s stock and they go out of business, you lose everything.\nDiversification reduces risk by spreading your money across different types of investments so that if one sector goes down, you don\\u2019t lose everything. A good rule of thumb is to put your money into a wide variety of investments, and don\\u2019t put more than 10% of your money into any one investment.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t invest in anything you don\\u2019t understand\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`If you don\\u2019t understand how a certain investment works or how it will generate a profit, you probably shouldn\\u2019t invest in it. In fact, you should absolutely stay away from any investment you don\\u2019t understand.\nInvestments that you don\\u2019t understand are more likely to lose you money than generate a profit. For example, if you invest in penny stocks, you\\u2019re likely to lose your money.\nInvestments like penny stocks are high-risk and aren\\u2019t for beginners.\nIf you don\\u2019t understand what you\\u2019re investing in, you\\u2019re better off investing in low-risk, low-reward options like CDs or savings accounts.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Owning a home is still the best investment\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`You\\u2019ve probably heard that stocks and bonds are the best investment. While that may be true over the long haul, real estate has always been the best investment in terms of one-time profit.\nOwning your home is still one of the best investments you can make. It doesn\\u2019t generate cash flow like stocks do, but it will increase in value over time thanks to inflation and demand.\nIf you buy a home and keep up with your mortgage payments, you have the potential to make a big profit when you go to sell it down the road.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Know your fees and costs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Most people are completely unaware of the fees associated with investing. For example, most mutual funds charge an upfront fee, and a percentage of the profits you earn from your investment.\nYour best bet for low-cost investment is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are low-cost, and you can buy and sell them just like stocks.\nMost brokerage accounts charge you a percentage of the total amount of money you have in them. So the more money you have in your account, the more you\\u2019ll pay in total fees.\nInvesting only what you\\u2019re comfortable losing is crucial. If something unexpected happens and you can\\u2019t make your investment payment, you\\u2019re better off not investing in it in the first place.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Take a small amount of cash to invest and stick to it\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`As a beginner investor, you\\u2019re not going to hit the jackpot right away. You\\u2019re going to have to be patient and let your money grow.\nInvesting a small amount of money each month, starting as soon as you can, is the best way to start growing your investments.\nIf you can spare $10 per month, start an investment account with a robo-advisor like Wealthsimple. You can open an account with as little as $10 per month.\nIf you can only spare $50 a month, that\\u2019s okay too. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.\nThat said, don\\u2019t go wild investing too much at once. You don\\u2019t want to put all your eggs in one basket.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Stick to your plan, no matter what\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`As a beginner, it can be tempting to try to time the market and predict when the stock market will rise or fall. But you never know when the next downturn will come around, or how long it will last.\nInvesting is a long-term game. It may not feel like it as you consistently check your investments and watch the market, but you have to remember that the market will go up over time.\nYou should always revisit your investment plan. Making regular contributions, investing in low-cost ETFs, and setting aside money in case of an emergency are all great ways to start investing now.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Bottom line\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`Investing is a skill that can take time to develop, but it\\u2019s one that anyone can learn with practice.\nIf you start investing early, you can use the power of compound interest to your advantage and grow your money faster.\nDon\\u2019t be intimidated by investing. With the right tools, it can be easy and accessible for anyone.\nAll that\\u2019s left to do is create a plan and start investing as soon as you can.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
