The different factors that impact performance, and how you can measure them. In this article, we\\u2019ll go over the specific strategies for tuning your Java applications to get better performance. There are many moving parts in a Java virtual machine and a variety of things that can negatively impact performance.\nWe\\u2019ll discuss a few specific techniques and configurations you can use to tune your JVM for improved performance. This includes heap size, code caching, compiler options, code usage, and interpreter mode.

It is a paradigm that allows you to think about your code in terms of input, output, and operations on those inputs and outputs. The advantages of using functional programming are higher code readability, ease of maintenance and testing, and shorter implementation time for complex algorithms.\nA variety of languages support functional programming features. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs as well as the other programming languages you already know. Depending on your preferences for syntax, size of community support, or availability of libraries for the type of projects you are working on now or might work on in future, different options might suit your needs better than others.\nIn this article we will explore some popular Go Language alternatives for Functional Programming with examples and pro/cons for each one:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
