There is a huge demand for coders right now, and it is only going to continue growing in the future. Some of the most successful people today got there because they mastered a coding language and used it to their advantage. Whether you are looking for a new career opportunity or something you can use on a personal level, learning to code is something that will not only expand your mind but also open up so many doors for you.\nCoding languages might seem intimidating at first glance, but once you get past the initial weirdness of reading something that seems like a foreign language, they are actually fairly straightforward. Even if you have no programming experience whatsoever, this article will give you all the information you need to begin your coder journey and find the perfect coding language for your needs.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

An interface, strictly speaking, is a type that specifies a set of methods, but not their implementation. This means that an interface can have static methods and accessible properties but no instance methods or fields.\nAn interface is a type that specifies only the behavior and not the implementation of an operation. The classes implementing this interface must provide their own implementation for every method declared in it. Interfaces are used extensively in Java to provide a common ground for classes to implement some functionality without revealing the internal implementation details.\nWhen we use interfaces, we are creating contracts between our classes that they will behave in a certain way\\u2014that they will implement certain methods and perform particular tasks when called upon to do so.
