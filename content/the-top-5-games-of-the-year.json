It received many praises for its interesting storyline and gameplay, which was inspired by the \\u201CThe End of the World\\u201D genre. The story takes place in the future and the world is left in ruins by a mysterious machine life form. The humans have been reduced to tribal civilizations living in primitive conditions, while the machines have developed intelligence and are now waging a war against them. Horizon Zero Dawn follows Aloy, a young outcast of a tribal society, who discovers that she\\u2019s connected to the machines and is able to destroy them with special arrows.

You can either try to escape by yourself or help a fellow prisoner, nicknamed \\u201CEight\\u201D, who is also on the ship.

It\\u2019s a single-player game and played from a third-person perspective. It revolves around an android army that is fighting an interplanetary war against humanity. You\\u2019re an android that has been sent to Earth to find out more about why the army is fighting.

The gameplay is basically a fight to the death between 100 players and it\\u2019s played from a first-person perspective. The goal of the game is to be the last man standing. You start off with nothing and have to find weapons, armor and other items to survive. The map is also filled with items that can help you, but only if you find them first. The game is played online with other real-life players, so you need to stay on your toes to survive the other players who are out to get you.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"1.
