Whether you prefer black, red, or kidney beans, they’re inexpensive and quick to cook. Beans can be added to salads or stews, or served as a side dish with any meal. Beans are also a good source of iron, which is especially important for menstruating women and growing kids. Iron deficiency is common among vegetarians since these people don’t consume the same iron sources as meat-eaters. Eating iron-rich foods with vitamin C-rich foods, such as beans with oranges, can help your body better absorb iron.\n\nTry adding a can of black beans to your next salad. Or make a Mexican-style stew with kidney beans, tomatoes, peppers, and cilantro. If you don’t like beans on their own, try adding them to soups or stews, or using them as a side dish with a protein like fish.\n\n## Brown Rice\n\nRice is a staple of many healthy diets, and brown rice is a healthier alternative to white rice. Brown rice is full of fibre, vitamins, and minerals and is high in protein. It can be served as a main dish, or used as a side dish to complement other meals.

Try serving brown rice with a stir fry or rice bowl with beans and veggies.\n\nIf you regularly eat white rice, try gradually switching to brown rice to gradually increase your fibre intake.
