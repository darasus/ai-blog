  You probably know that eating a healthy diet is important. After all,
  five out of the top 10 causes of death in America are linked to unhealthy
  eating habits. However, it’s not always easy to eat healthy. Work, school,
  family obligations and other commitments often make it challenging to follow a
  healthy diet on a daily basis. Fortunately, there are ways to make healthy
  eating a part of your lifestyle instead of an awkward obligation once a week
  or so. 

  And while we all have our moments when we crave junk food or a big greasy meal after a stressful day, making healthy eating a part of your everyday life can have profound benefits. A balanced diet filled with lots of fruits and vegetables lowers risk for almost every disease and helps you feel better mentally and physically. Follow these tips to help you integrate healthy eating into your daily routine as seamlessly as possible.

## Plan ahead

Even if you eat the healthiest foods on the planet, if you don’t plan for them, you won’t eat them. Remember to factor in time for shopping and preparing food, especially if you work in an office and have limited access to a kitchen. While you don’t want to spend every waking moment thinking about food, planning your meals in advance can help you ensure that you eat a well-rounded diet. 

Additionally, make sure you have healthy snacks on hand. Nuts, seeds, and fruits are great options that won’t derail your healthy eating efforts. If you have snacks readily available, you won’t have to rely on vending machine snacks that are high in sugar and fat.

## Start with breakfast

Eating a healthy breakfast is perhaps one of the best ways to build a healthy diet. You can start your day with a smoothie packed with fruits and vegetables, oatmeal topped with nuts or seeds, a yogurt parfait or a variety of other nutrient-dense options. 

Research shows that people who eat breakfast are more successful at losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight than those who skip the first meal of the day. Breakfast also helps to regulate blood sugar and prevent fluctuations that can lead to cravings later in the day.

## Commit to lunch and dinner too

While breakfast is an important meal, what you do later in the day can be just as important for a healthy diet. That’s because most people tend to eat the majority of their calories during lunch and dinner. 

Instead of ordering takeout or eating at restaurants, where you can’t control what’s in your meal, make meals at home. This gives you full control over your diet. You can add plenty of vegetables and fruits to your meals to make them more nutritious. 

There are plenty of easy recipes out there that pack plenty of vegetables and other nutritious ingredients into a single dish. This can help ensure you get enough vitamins and minerals without feeling like you’re on a strict diet.

## Don't skip snacks

Dining out once in awhile or having a meal prepared by a friend or family member once or twice a week is fine. However, many people who are trying to lose weight or eat a healthier diet tend to forget snacks. Oftentimes, the problem with those who are trying to lose weight is that they have either too little or too much food.

If you’re trying to eat more healthily, don’t skip out on snacks. Many of the same foods that you should eat at lunch and dinner can also be eaten as a snack. Nuts, fruits, whole grains, and vegetables are all great snacks. Remember that you don’t want to overeat at meals, so don’t eat more than you can handle.

## Try new foods

Healthy eating isn’t about denying yourself everything you love, but it does require eating a variety of new foods. You don’t have to stop eating your favorite foods, but you should try to mix up what you eat every day. Eating a variety of foods gives you more nutrients. You can also help prevent boredom and cravings by eating different foods.

If you’re struggling to come up with new ideas, consider trying one of the many themed diets out there. There are plenty of diet plans that focus on specific foods or provide guidance for the amount of calories and other aspects of a healthy diet. 

While following a specific diet isn’t ideal for everyone, it can be helpful for some people. You can also find inspiration on social media and by talking to friends about healthy eating.

## Exercise regularly

Regular exercise is important for a healthy diet. This can be as simple as taking a walk at lunch or riding a bike to work. Exercising regularly can help to regulate your appetite and reduce the amount of calories you eat during the day. 

For best results, aim to work out for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. This can be as simple as walking, gardening, or doing yoga at home. If you don’t have time for a full workout, even a 10-minute walk around the block can help to improve your health and eating habits. 

Exercising regularly can also help you sleep better, reduce your risk for depression, reduce stress, and improve your overall mood. All of these can help you make healthier eating choices.
