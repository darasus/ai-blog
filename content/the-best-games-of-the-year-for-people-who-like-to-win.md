intro: >-
  Have you ever sat through a game of Pandemic with your friends and just
  wanted to shake them? Or maybe you’ve played with people who were so scared of
  losing that they refused to take any risks? Perhaps you’ve been on the other
  side, acting like a jerk just to get your friend mad and force them to win.

  Scrubs, control-freaks, cautious nerds— there are as many types of board gamers as there are games. It turns out there’s even more diversity than that. There are people who love word puzzles ( Codenames ), people who prefer their games fast and furious ( Smash Up ), and everyone in between.

  If you know someone who loves Pandemic but isn’t so fond of losing, this list is for you. Here we have compiled some of the best strategy games released this year.

## Munchkin Adventure Time 2 – Be More and DO More!

Munchkin is a very silly game about being the first person to get ten “levels” and defeat the “bad guy.” It’s a game about bluffing, cheating, and being outrageously over the top. It’s a game about winning.

If you’ve ever wanted to play a game where you can team up with friends to take down monstrous rats while also stealing their stuff and stabbing them in the back, then Munchkin is for you. This game is stupid, but it’s also tons of fun.
