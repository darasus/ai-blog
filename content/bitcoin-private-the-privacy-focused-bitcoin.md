summary: Bitcoin Private is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that
  allows direct payments between two parties, private and secure, without the
  need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin Private was forked from the Bitcoin
  blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date
  is unknown because of a bug in their code) It was airdropped to Bitcoin and
  ZClassic holders and gave them 1 BTCP for every 1 BTC and ZCL they held when
  the snapshot was taken. Bitcoin’s privacy issues are rooted in its scalability
  issues.
intro: >-
  Bitcoin has grown from a small network of geeks into the world’s leading
  cryptocurrency. With a market capitalization of over $115 billion, Bitcoin has
  come a long way. But it is not without its problems. The prevalence of
  centralized exchanges and custodial services, as well as recent price
  manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users
  of the virtual currency. 

  Moreover, with institutions, governments and individuals increasingly recognizing the value of digital tokens, crypto-anarchists are becoming concerned that Bitcoin may not be sufficiently anonymous to protect against intrusion from authorities or intermediaries (e.g., exchanges and data brokers). This has led to an increase in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies— known as ‘privacy coins’— like ZCash, Dash and Monero. 

  Thankfully, there is also a solution within this problem: Bitcoin Private (BTCP).

## What is Bitcoin Private?

Bitcoin Private is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that allows direct payments between two parties, private and secure, without the need for a trusted third party. The open-source project is fully decentralized and was built using the same open-source codebase that is used by Bitcoin. It was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.

The fork was airdropped to Bitcoin and ZClassic holders and gave them 1 BTCP for every 1 BTC and ZCL they held when the snapshot was taken.

## A short history of Bitcoin and the privacy problem

The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a decentralized digital cash system that could make online payments more convenient, cheaper and more accessible. But as the network and virtual currency grew, Bitcoin’s lack of privacy became a problem.

A lack of privacy is a serious threat to all financial networks, but it is especially dangerous in a decentralized system like Bitcoin. With no controlling authority, the network must rely on users to report malicious activities. However, if users’ identities can be linked to their actions, reporting becomes much more difficult.

In Bitcoin, privacy is achieved by obscuring both the sender and recipient of every transaction. Unfortunately, this is not done by default. Instead, it relies on certain precautions being taken, such as using a wallet that obscures IP addresses and using a special protocol that mixes the user’s ‘tumbler’ inputs with the inputs of other users. Unfortunately, these precautions are not foolproof. While they are enough to remain largely anonymous in casual use, they are insufficient for frequent use. As a result, frequent Bitcoin users—such as those who use it for online purchases—have had their identities and wallets linked to their activities.

## Why is Bitcoin not private by default?

Bitcoin was originally created to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital cash system that could make online payments more convenient, cheaper and more accessible. Privacy was important to the original creators of Bitcoin, but the lack of privacy was not intended to be a design flaw. It was a compromise. A compromise between scalability, decentralization, and privacy.

Bitcoin’s privacy issues are rooted in its scalability issues. As discussed in the Scalability and decentralization section, Bitcoin has a hard time scaling to meet the demands of a growing user base. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bitcoin transactions need to be verified by a network of distributed nodes, many of which are not incentivized to do so. In order to incentivize more nodes to join the network and process transactions, block size limits and transaction fees were added as throttles to manage the flow of data. The throttles, however, also made it harder for nodes to process transactions in a timely manner. To compensate, the system was programmed to include a feature called “partial fungibility”: transactions with smaller fees would be processed after the others and given less priority. This had the added effect of making the system less private without any added benefit.

## How does Bitcoin Private fix the privacy problem?

Bitcoin Private was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain at block height 499800 (around February or March 2018, exact date is unknown because of a bug in their code), and by combining its code with ZClassic (another open-source fork of Zcash that also fixed the privacy issue), it also fixed privacy issues of both Bitcoin and ZClassic.

Similar to Zcash, Bitcoin Private uses a “zk-SNARK” type of proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In this system, each node is given a unique “key” that they use to generate “addresses” (which are just numbers). Instead of the node’s IP address being tied to its unique “key”, it is tied to the IP address of the node that is hosting it.

## Is BTCP an improvement over BTC and BCH?

The developers of Bitcoin Private claim that the currency offers a “genuine” and “privacy-focused” alternative to both Bitcoin and ZCash, but it is difficult to say if it is an improvement over both.

Bitcoin is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, with $116 billion market cap and a price of $5800. It is the most decentralized cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners in hundreds of countries. It has the strongest network effect and the largest user base.

ZCash is the second most popular privacy coin, with a $1.9 billion market cap and a price of $75. It is the least decentralized cryptocurrency among the top 10 coins by market cap. There are only 10 nodes and they are all controlled by the company that created it. It has a strong focus on privacy, but is criticized by the crypto-anarchists for relying on a trusted “black box” (i.e., the centralization of nodes and the “zk-SNARK” consensus mechanism).

Bitcoin Private is the newest privacy coin and has the least user base among the three. Its market cap is currently $346 million and its price is $64. It is the most decentralized privacy coin among the top 10 coins by market cap. It is also the only privacy coin that is not criticized for relying on a “black box” for privacy. It has the strongest focus on the crypto-anarchist community.

## Conclusion

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have come a long way since their inception in 2009. The original Bitcoin has grown to become the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency, having a market capitalization of around $115 billion. However, it is not without its problems. The prevalence of centralized exchanges, as well as price manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users of the virtual currency.
The high demand for more private cryptocurrencies has led to an increase in the value of privacy coins like ZCash and Monero. But there is also a solution within this problem: Bitcoin Private.
This new privacy coin is a fork of the Bitcoin and ZClassic blockchains with a “zk-SNARK” type of consensus mechanism. It is the most decentralized privacy coin among the top 10 coins by market cap, and it has the strongest focus on the crypto-anarchist community.
