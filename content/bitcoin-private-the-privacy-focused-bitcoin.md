Bitcoin Private is a privacy-focused Bitcoin fork that launched in March 2018. The project is a fork of Zclassic and Bitcoin, and uses the zk-SNARKS privacy protocol. Bitcoin Private is a community-driven project that is funded and maintained by donations. The project has no premine or ICO, and all development is done by volunteers. The Bitcoin Private team is committed to providing a safe, secure, and private way to store and transact Bitcoin. The project is also working on adding support for other cryptocurrencies, and plans to launch a mobile wallet in the future.
