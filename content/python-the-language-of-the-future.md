## What is Python?

The Python programming language was first released in 1991. Since then, it has been adopted by millions of developers around the world and became the most popular programming language used in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.

The name “Python” comes from the snake, which has long been associated with the concept of programming. The creator of Python implemented his programming language with a spython is highly readable and easy to learn. The simplicity of the language makes it easy to learn, but also very powerful, which means you can create complex programs in a short amount of time.

If you want to get started with Python, you can download and install the Python programming language from python.org/downloads. You can either install a “regular” Python or a Python 3 version. Python 2 will remain fully supported until 2020, but most of the new libraries and tools are using Python 3. Therefore, if you are learning Python for the first time, the best choice is to start with Python 3.
