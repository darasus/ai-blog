## What is Python?

The Python programming language was first released in 1991. Since then, it has been adopted by millions of developers around the world and became the most popular programming language used in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.

The name “Python” comes from the snake, which has long been associated with the concept of programming. The creator of Python implemented his programming language with a spython is highly readable and easy to learn. The simplicity of the language makes it easy to learn, but also very powerful, which means you can create complex programs in a short amount of time.

If you want to get started with Python, you can download and install the Python programming language from python.org/downloads. You can either install a “regular” Python or a Python 3 version. Python 2 will remain fully supported until 2020, but most of the new libraries and tools are using Python 3. Therefore, if you are learning Python for the first time, the best choice is to start with Python 3.

## Why Is Python So Popular?

Many people wonder why Python has become so popular over the years when there are other, more established languages out there. The answer is this: Python has many benefits. It is easy to learn, easy to read, and very versatile.

Python is easy to learn. This is one of the main reasons why it has been adopted by many new programmers and students. It is also the reason why experienced programmers choose to use it. Python can be learned in a short amount of time.

Python is easy to read. This makes it ideal for creating documentation and collaborating on projects with other developers.

Python has a wide range of uses. It can be used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and much more. This makes it useful for almost any career in programming.

## Getting Started With Python

The best way to start learning Python is to learn the basics. Start with the Python language syntax, then move on to the different data types, control flow, and functions and methods. Once you’ve mastered the basics, try creating a small program or start working through a few programming challenges online.

When you’re ready to take your Python skills to the next level, consider signing up for an online course or coding bootcamp. Many online courses are free and provide a great introduction to Python. Coding bootcamps are intensive programs that allow you to learn the most important skills in a short amount of time.
