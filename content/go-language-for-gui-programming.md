The Go programming language is an open source project created by Google. It is a compiled, statically typed language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

The Go programming language was created by Google in 2009. It was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is an open source project. The main motivation for its creation was the need for a language that would be easy to learn for programmers coming from other languages, yet would be sufficiently powerful and efficient for systems programming.

One of the most distinctive features of Go is its use of a concurrent programming model based on goroutines and channels. This makes it easy to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously without the need for explicit locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

Another important feature of Go is its support for garbage collection. This allows programmers to reclaim memory that is no longer needed by their program, without having to explicitly deallocate it.

Go also has a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functionality, including support for networking, cryptography, and compression.

In addition to its use as a systems programming language, Go is also becoming popular for writing web applications and microservices. Many popular web frameworks and application servers are written in Go, including Revel, Echo, and Iris.
