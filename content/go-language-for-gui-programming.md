summary: Go's simple syntax and readable code make it easier for developers to
  understand one another’s work and make changes as requirements change. The
  language has built-in support for both communications with other systems and
  data flow within the application. Go has a syntax that is similar to languages
  such as C and Java, which makes it easy for developers who have worked with
  these languages to transition to Go. Go is still in beta, so you should plan
  to keep up with new language features as they’re implemented.
intro: >-
  The Go programming language has become an attractive option for
  developers working on software projects that require fast performance, ease of
  deployment, and compact code.

  Go was developed by Google as an alternative to C++ for programs that are memory- and performance-intensive. Its simple syntax and powerful features have made it especially popular among programmers who specialize in building compilers and interpreters.

  Go is a general-purpose programming language with support for structured methods, visibility qualifiers, and embedded type definitions. It’s a statically typed language with support for interfaces,Ad hoc polymorphism, and type embedding. 

  In this blog post, we explore the considerations you need to make when choosing a programming language for GUI programming. Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of using Go for your next GUI project.

## Easy to Learn and Maintain

One of the most important considerations when choosing a language for GUI programming is how easy it is to learn and maintain. Go’s simple syntax and readable code make it easier for developers to understand one another’s work and make changes as requirements change.
Go has a syntax that is similar to languages such as C and Java, which makes it easy for developers who have worked with these languages to transition to Go.
If you have experience with languages such as Python or JavaScript, you’ll find Go’s braces and semicolons familiar, though it will take a little time to adjust to Go’s slightly different syntax and idioms.
Go’s syntax has evolved over the years and has been influenced by the feedback of the programming community. This means that you can find lots of resources to help you learn how to use the language.

## Built-in Support for Networking

One area where people who have worked in C and C++ notice the difference is in the ease with which you can do networking with Go.
The networked applications that we write today are Go native. They’re built in from the word “go”, as the saying goes.
Because of the ease with which Go code can access the network and other computing systems, it’s a great choice for GUI applications that require communication with remote servers or with other systems on the network.
Go has built-in support for HTTP and HTTPS, with support for other networking protocols such as FTP and SOCKS.
Since the language was developed by Google, the company’s experience with distributed computing is evident in Go’s handling of networking.

## Built-in Concurrency Support

Another area where Go’s origins are evident is in its support for concurrency, or the ability to execute code simultaneously.
With GUI applications, concurrency can be important for managing the flow of data in and out of the application itself. You might, for example, want to retrieve data from a database and display it in a table while your application is also processing a user’s request to sort or filter the table’s data.
For this, you need a language that supports concurrency so that your program can process the user’s request and retrieve the data from the database at the same time.
Go’s concurrency features make it an excellent choice for GUI applications. The language has built-in support for both communications with other systems and data flow within the application.
You can use channels to communicate with other parts of your application and to communicate with other systems such as databases or remote servers.

## Go is Still in Beta

One important thing to keep in mind when considering Go is that it’s still in beta. The language is under active development and has been since 2009, when it was first released as an experimental language.
This means that you can expect new features to be added to the language, and you should plan to keep up with those changes as you’re developing your GUI application.
If you’re working in a high-stakes environment, you may want to choose a language that’s out of beta and has a longer track record in production environments.
However, if you’re working on an application that’s experimental in nature or is intended for internal use, you may want to use Go, as it will allow you to take advantage of new language features as they’re implemented.

## Go’s Packaging Problem

One disadvantage of Go is its lack of a standard packaging system, which is the way that programmers organize and distribute code.
Packaging is an important part of any programming language and is one of the things that makes it easy to work with a language.
If you’ve worked with a language like Java or Python, you’ve probably used the language’s built-in packaging system.
As you’ve probably noticed, it makes it easy to import code from other sources and to use that code in your application.
Go doesn’t have a standard packaging system, but there are a few different ways to address this problem. You may, for example, use a version control system such as Git to manage your code.
Or you can use a package manager such as Godep or Glide to manage the code in your application.
Any of these options will make it easy for you to use code written by other programmers.

## Conclusion

Go is an excellent language for GUI programming with its simple syntax, built-in support for concurrency, and easy network access. If you choose to program in Go, however, be prepared to keep up with changes to the language and its associated tools.
If you’re working in a high-stakes environment where the software needs to be extremely reliable, you may want to choose a language that’s out of beta. When you make that decision, keep in mind that you can still use Go for your GUI.
Choose the language that best meets the needs of your application, and you’ll be well on your way to creating an excellent GUI application.
