intro: >-
  Apple is one of the most popular and well-known brands in the world. Its
  distinctive logo is recognized everywhere, from airports to hotels, from art
  galleries to aquariums. What’s more, Apple products are some of the most
  desirable on the market. Many people aspire to own a Mac, iPhone or iPad
  because they’re sleek and stylish, as well as packed with useful features. 

  The history of Apple goes back to 1981 when Steve Jobs founded the company at age 21. In that period there was a famous video game crash where Atari and other gaming companies made losses due to overproduction and in response many gamers stopped buying video games for almost four years. This led to Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs’ friend) proposing that they start their own computer company – which became known as Apple Computer Inc.

  What follows is a detailed look into the history of Apple Inc., including details about key executives and any relevant organizational changes.

## 1980: The Birth of Apple Computer Inc.

In April 1976, two young engineers, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, were working for a company called Atari in Silicon Valley. They were designing arcade games, but they wanted to design computers as well. They wanted to design a small computer that could be used at home, like an arcade machine. So they designed a computer, but they couldn’t sell it at Homebrew Computer Club in Menlo Park.

After that, they decided to make their own computer, the Apple I. They started selling the computer at The Byte Shop in Mountain View. Paul Terrell, the owner of The Byte Shop, wanted to buy 50 computers, but Wozniak said he could only make 50.

## 1984: Macintosh is Introduced

Some time later, Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer – a compact, easy-to-use computer with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enabled users to navigate through menus with the click of a mouse. The computer was revolutionary; it was the first computer to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a design feature that has since become standard.

## 1997: Introduction of the iMac

In 1998, Apple introduced the iMac, a computer with a unique, translucent “Bondi Blue” color finish and an intuitive “click and drag” interface that made it easy for even novice computer users to navigate. The iMac quickly became one of the most popular computers on the market.

## 2001: iTunes is Released

In 2001, Apple created “iTunes,” an online store that allowed users to purchase and download music. The store quickly became extremely popular and revolutionized the music industry. At the time, the music industry was facing challenges due to copyright infringement, file sharing and piracy that hurt profits. iTunes provided a legal way for consumers to purchase music online.

## 2003: iPhone is Introduced

In 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone, a cell phone that featured a touchscreen display, a fully functional Web browser and the ability to download and store music, photos and apps. The phone was an instant success: within the first year, Apple sold more than 9 million iPhones, more than analysts predicted the company would sell in the first five years. In 2012, Apple introduced the iPhone 5, an upgraded model featuring a slimmer design, a larger screen and a “Siri” voice assistant that can aid in tasks like setting reminders, searching the Internet, placing phone calls and finding the nearest Starbucks.

## 2010: iPad is Released and iOS 5 is Launched

In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, a tablet computer that featured a touchscreen display, a fully functional Web browser, the ability to download and store music, photos and apps and could run many of the same programs that could be run on a laptop computer. The ultra-portable device was an instant success: by 2014, it had become the world’s most popular tablet computer. In 2012, Apple introduced iOS 5, an upgraded version of its operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. The software featured several new features, including the “Siri” voice assistant and “iCloud,” a cloud storage service that allows users to store music, photos and documents online and access them from any computer or iOS device.

## 2013: iPhone 5s and 5c are Released

In 2013, Apple released the iPhone 5s, a high-end smartphone featuring a fingerprint scanner and “Touch ID” technology that allows users to unlock the phone and sign into various apps with a fingerprint. The device also came with a “64-bit architecture” that made it faster and more efficient than the iPhone 5. In addition, Apple released the iPhone 5c, a less expensive model that featured a colorful design that made it easy to personalize with different “rubber band” colored bands.

## 2014: Apple Pay, Watch and ResearchKit are Released

In 2014, Apple introduced Apple Pay, a mobile payment service that allows users to make purchases by placing their iPhone near a special contactless reader at checkout. The service was billed as more secure and private than other mobile payment services, as it uses a person’s fingerprint and a code generated by the phone to make a transaction, rather than a credit card number. The company also released ResearchKit, a software platform designed to help medical researchers collect data more easily and efficiently.

## 2015-2016: Final Words

In 2015, Apple released the iPhone 6S, a refreshed model featuring a 12-megapixel camera, a new processor and “Force Touch,” a feature that allows users to press the screen harder to access additional functions. The company also released the iPhone 6S Plus, a larger version of the device. In 2016, Apple released the iPhone 7, a refreshed version of the phone featuring a new camera, redesigned housing and “AirPods,” wireless earbuds designed to work with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The company also launched the Apple Watch 2, a refreshed version of the company’s smartwatch featuring a more powerful processor and a built-in GPS.
