  "summary": "Pressure cooking uses steam to cook food quickly and efficiently, while preserving the nutrients in the food. Pressure cookers come to pressure when the water inside it reaches a certain boiling point. You can’t really cook food that’s meant to be “boiled” in a pressure cooker. The temperature of the pot will range from 100-390F, which is below the boiling temperature of water. The pot inside the appliance is called a “dual pressure” pot. This means that it can cook food at both low pressure and high pressure.",
