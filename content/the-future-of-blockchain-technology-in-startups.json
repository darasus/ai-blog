This technology is primarily used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zcash. But blockchain has many other use cases as well. For example, it can be used for supply chain management, smart contracts, online voting, insurance claim settlement, digital rights management, and real estate transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A blockchain consists of nodes that are connected to each other via a network. These nodes keep a record of all the transactions that occur in the system and are verified by the nodes. A blockchain network can be permissionless, permissioned, or a hybrid of the two. In a permissionless network, nobody approves or rejects transactions. On the other hand, in a permissioned network, only a pre-selected set of nodes can approve or reject transactions.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Blockchain Isn\\u2019t Just About Bitcoin?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Blockchain technology has become synonymous with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it\\u2019s so much more than that. In fact, many people don\\u2019t even understand how it works. But to be fair, if we look back in history, we will see that the internet wasn\\u2019t designed for the kind of business that it\\u2019s now used for.

This ensures that all stakeholders can view the data and transactions, thereby bringing in transparency. You don\\u2019t have to trust one central authority as the data is verified by nodes across the network. That\\u2019s why it is increasingly being used by industries such as healthcare and real estate to bring in trust and transparency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Faster and Cheaper Transactions - Blockchain is peer-to-peer, meaning that there is no need for a centralized authority to conduct the transactions. This brings in a trust-free, cost-effective, and faster settlement of transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Strong Security - This is one of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology for businesses.

Investors prefer investing in startups over large corporations. But if they see that blockchain startups are losing the race against these giants, they won\\u2019t invest.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Regulatory Hurdles - Blockchain startups face regulatory challenges because of the unregulated nature of the technology. The lack of proper regulations puts blockchain startups at risk of using the technology illegally. If a blockchain startup wants to launch an ICO, it has to comply with the SEC rules.

With a market capitalization of over $115 billion, Bitcoin has come a long way. But it is not without its problems. The prevalence of centralized exchanges and custodial services, as well as recent price manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users of the virtual currency.\nMoreover, with institutions, governments and individuals increasingly recognizing the value of digital tokens, crypto-anarchists are becoming concerned that Bitcoin may not be sufficiently anonymous to protect against intrusion from authorities or intermediaries (e.g., exchanges and data brokers). This has led to an increase in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies\\u2014 known as \\u2018privacy coins\\u2019\\u2014 like ZCash, Dash and Monero.\nThankfully, there is also a solution within this problem: Bitcoin Private (BTCP).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future.
