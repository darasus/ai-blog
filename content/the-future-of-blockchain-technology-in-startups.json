For example, it can be used for supply chain management, smart contracts, online voting, insurance claim settlement, digital rights management, and real estate transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A blockchain consists of nodes that are connected to each other via a network. These nodes keep a record of all the transactions that occur in the system and are verified by the nodes. A blockchain network can be permissionless, permissioned, or a hybrid of the two. In a permissionless network, nobody approves or rejects transactions. On the other hand, in a permissioned network, only a pre-selected set of nodes can approve or reject transactions.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Blockchain Isn\\u2019t Just About Bitcoin?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Blockchain technology has become synonymous with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it\\u2019s so much more than that. In fact, many people don\\u2019t even understand how it works. But to be fair, if we look back in history, we will see that the internet wasn\\u2019t designed for the kind of business that it\\u2019s now used for.

This ensures that all stakeholders can view the data and transactions, thereby bringing in transparency. You don\\u2019t have to trust one central authority as the data is verified by nodes across the network. That\\u2019s why it is increasingly being used by industries such as healthcare and real estate to bring in trust and transparency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Faster and Cheaper Transactions - Blockchain is peer-to-peer, meaning that there is no need for a centralized authority to conduct the transactions. This brings in a trust-free, cost-effective, and faster settlement of transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Strong Security - This is one of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology for businesses.

In the last couple of years, we have seen an exponential growth in businesses using the decentralized technology for various use cases across different industries. We also see a rise in new blockchain startups coming into the market with their new solutions based on this technology.\nAs per a Statista article, the global blockchain market is expected to grow from $210 million in 2021 to $66 billion by 2026. This means there are ample opportunities for startups and businesses to leverage this technology and create innovative solutions for problems that can be solved using decentralized ledgers and smart contracts.\nIf you are thinking about incorporating blockchain into your business model, you\\u2019ve come to the right place! In this blog post, we will discuss why you should use blockchain technology for your startup, what are the advantages of Blockchain Technology for Startups and how exactly can you implement it.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations.
