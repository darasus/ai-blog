It is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. This technology is primarily used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zcash. But blockchain has many other use cases as well. For example, it can be used for supply chain management, smart contracts, online voting, insurance claim settlement, digital rights management, and real estate transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A blockchain consists of nodes that are connected to each other via a network. These nodes keep a record of all the transactions that occur in the system and are verified by the nodes. A blockchain network can be permissionless, permissioned, or a hybrid of the two. In a permissionless network, nobody approves or rejects transactions. On the other hand, in a permissioned network, only a pre-selected set of nodes can approve or reject transactions.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why Blockchain Isn\\u2019t Just About Bitcoin?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Blockchain technology has become synonymous with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it\\u2019s so much more than that. In fact, many people don\\u2019t even understand how it works. But to be fair, if we look back in history, we will see that the internet wasn\\u2019t designed for the kind of business that it\\u2019s now used for. It took time and the right technology to create effective business models, just like the internet. The same is true for blockchain. It\\u2019s a new technology with a lot of potential, and it will take time for businesses and investors to understand how to use it effectively.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"5 Key Benefits of Using Blockchain in Startups\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"It Provides Transparency - As blockchain runs on a distributed network, it is transparent and secure. This ensures that all stakeholders can view the data and transactions, thereby bringing in transparency. You don\\u2019t have to trust one central authority as the data is verified by nodes across the network. That\\u2019s why it is increasingly being used by industries such as healthcare and real estate to bring in trust and transparency.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Faster and Cheaper Transactions - Blockchain is peer-to-peer, meaning that there is no need for a centralized authority to conduct the transactions. This brings in a trust-free, cost-effective, and faster settlement of transactions.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Strong Security - This is one of the biggest advantages of blockchain technology for businesses. Using encryption and cryptography, blockchain secures the data and transactions. Nobody, not even the miners can access the data without proper permission.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"3 Major Challenges for Blockchain Technology in Startups\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Risk of Being Overwhelmed by the Competition - Though blockchain startups are on the rise, there are already several big players in the market such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. The technology giants have already started investing in the technology and have launched some promising products. This puts blockchain startups at an inherent disadvantage. Investors prefer investing in startups over large corporations. But if they see that blockchain startups are losing the race against these giants, they won\\u2019t invest.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Regulatory Hurdles - Blockchain startups face regulatory challenges because of the unregulated nature of the technology. The lack of proper regulations puts blockchain startups at risk of using the technology illegally. If a blockchain startup wants to launch an ICO, it has to comply with the SEC rules. If it doesn\\u2019t, it will be shut down. But this is something that many startups don\\u2019t want to do because it brings in regulation and impacts the business model.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Lack of Trust among Investors - After the Bitcoin crash, investors are wary of investing in blockchain startups.

It can bring in trust, transparency, faster and cheaper transactions, and increased security. If you are planning to invest in a blockchain-based startup or are currently working on one, here are a few things to keep in mind.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Start with the problem - Before starting to implement blockchain technology, you have to first decide the problem that you are trying to solve. Blockchain, like any other technology, is not a solution to every business problem. You have to find the right use case to implement blockchain and solve the problem.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Define the solution - Once you have identified the problem, you have to define the solution.
