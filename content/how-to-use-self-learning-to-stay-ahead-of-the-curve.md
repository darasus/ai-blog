## Know what you need to learn

First and foremost, you need to identify what you actually need to learn. If you’re constantly trying to learn everything, you’ll never actually get anything done. By knowing the topics that you need to master to stay competitive in your field, you can then narrow down the best ways to learn those things. Are there certain skills you need to learn to advance in your company? Are there certain news stories you need to follow in your field? By knowing the specific topics you need to master, you can then figure out how to go about doing so most efficiently.

## Read the news in your field

If you want to make sure you’re on top of everything happening in your field, you’ll need to stay up to date with the news. Not only does reading the news give you insight into the latest happenings in your industry, but it also lets you know what questions people are asking about your field. You can use these questions as a way to figure out where you need to learn more. If there are certain topics you need to brush up on, you can start with those articles. If there are questions you find yourself not knowing the answer to, you can use those as a way to get in touch with experts in your industry to get answers to your questions. Reading the news in your field is an efficient way to learn more without having to actively seek out information.

## Read books on your field

Reading books on your field is a great way to get a general overview of the history and basic concepts of your industry. By reading books, you can learn the history of your field while also creating a solid foundation of knowledge to build on top of. This is especially helpful if you work in a field like computer programming or engineering where there is a lot of math or science involved. Reading books can help you understand the basic concepts behind the numbers so you can apply them more easily in the real world.

## Watch videos and observe people in your industry

If there are certain skills you need to learn, or you want to get a feel for how your industry works in real life, you can also watch videos of people in your industry. This can include watching tech tutorials, conference speeches or online lectures. By watching videos and observing other people in your industry, you can learn what skills you need to master while also getting a sense of how they are using those skills in real life. This can be especially helpful if you work in a non-technical field and would like to understand more about the tech skills you’ll be working with.

## Ask experts about the stuff you don’t understand

If you’ve gone through all the above avenues and you’re still struggling to understand certain topics, there’s no shame in getting help. One of the greatest things about working in a tech-based industry is that most people are happy to talk to you about what they do.  If you are struggling to understand something, ask the person who knows about it. There’s no better way to learn than by getting one-on-one feedback from the experts in your field.

Self-learning is a great strategy for staying ahead of the curve while also making sure you’re not wasting too much time relearning things you already know.
