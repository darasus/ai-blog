Just make sure you do some research first, so you know what to expect and have a good idea of how challenging it will be. If you\\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or intimidated, consider trying out a new hobby class. From pottery to painting, there are plenty of fun, creative options.

At the very least, you\\u2019ll encourage each other to show up and get started, which can be enough to help you get through the session. Plus, friends can provide the extra push you might need to try a new or challenging workout. Exercising with friends can take many forms, though. You can go for walks or runs together, go to the gym, attend a yoga or dance class, or even play a sport. It can be great to have other people who are working out alongside you nearby, but it\\u2019s also beneficial to have people you can go out of your way to hang out with and exercise with, too. It can make the experience more social and help you stay accountable for your regular workouts.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Get a Good Music Mix\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you love to dance and listen to music when you work out, great! If not, consider putting on a good music mix, especially if you\\u2019re doing an indoor workout. Music has several benefits for workouts, and it can make any exercise more fun. It can help you keep your rhythm while you exercise, and it can make you more likely to stick with your workout, according to research. It can also help you increase your intensity level, which can help you get better results. Make sure you choose the right music for your workout. Songs with a steady rhythm that aren\\u2019t too distracting are best.

If you don\\u2019t see a connection between your daily workout and the results you want, it can be hard to stay motivated. To make your workout more fun, set realistic goals for yourself that you can achieve in your workouts. Something as simple as increasing your speed or intensity level by a certain percentage each week can help you see the progress you\\u2019re making. This can help you feel like your workout is worth it, and it can even help you stay motivated to try new activities and exercise variations.

For example, if you usually exercise for an hour three times per week, try committing to only doing it once a week for only 30 minutes. It might be easier to get yourself to show up for a shorter workout, and once you\\u2019re there, you might find you enjoy the experience more than you expected once you\\u2019re into it. Plus, short workouts are still beneficial. And once you\\u2019re used to exercising on a regular basis, you can always increase your time, frequency, or intensity as you progress. As long as you don\\u2019t make a habit of short workouts, you can also transition from short workouts to longer workouts as soon as you feel ready.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Go to the Gym When You\\u2019re Most Tired\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you don\\u2019t have enough energy or are feeling unmotivated, consider waiting until you feel more tired to go to the gym.

And while you might notice it\\u2019s harder, you might not realize how much stronger you\\u2019re getting. As a result, you may enjoy your workouts more once you start to notice your progress. Plus, a tired workout might be less boring and more challenging than a normal workout. If you\\u2019re feeling tired, consider doing something a little more challenging or interesting than you normally would. You might find it easier than you expected, and you can feel good knowing you pushed yourself harder than you would have if you were fully rested.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Watch Funny Videos Beforehand\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you\\u2019re having a hard time getting yourself motivated to workout, try watching a few funny videos beforehand. This can help get your mind off how you\\u2019re feeling and distract you enough to get you fired up. Plus, you might even find yourself laughing, which can help you break through mental barriers. The important thing is picking the right video. Make sure you don\\u2019t pick something that\\u2019s too silly or silly all the way through, or you won\\u2019t be able to focus on it.

If you don\\u2019t exercise as often, or as intensely as someone else, you\\u2019re likely not to see the same results. And even if you do exercise at the same intensity as someone else, your progress is going to depend on your nutrition and genetics, too. Try to avoid comparing yourself to others, and focus on your own progress and results. This will help you enjoy your workouts more, and you\\u2019ll be less likely to get discouraged.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Exercising is a great way to stay healthy and fit. But what if you hate to exercise? It can be hard to motivate yourself to go to the gym or go on a run when you don't really enjoy it. But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to make your workouts more fun so that you'll actually look forward to them. From trying a new exercise class to getting a good music mix and watching funny videos, there are plenty of ways to make your workouts more fun.

However, there are ways to make your food dollars go further and still eat well.\nInstead of making weekly trips to multiple stores and markets, plan a shopping day and hit one store at a time. Look for sales in that store before you go and stock up on foods that are good value. You might even consider investing in a membership card or becoming an insider or club member so you get vouchers or other discounts. Adding your own spin on some classic cheap meals will also help you save money without sacrificing nutrition.
