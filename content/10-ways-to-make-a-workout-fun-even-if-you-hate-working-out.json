  "content": "## Try a New Exercise Class\n\nIf you’re a regular attendee at the gym and have tried all the machines by now, or if you’re tired of the same old running or cycling classes, consider taking a new exercise class. Whether it’s a group fitness class at your local gym, like Zumba or Spinning, or a fitness class you find at a nearby studio or health center. There are plenty of options. Just make sure you do some research first, so you know what to expect and have a good idea of how challenging it will be. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or intimidated, consider trying out a new hobby class. From pottery to painting, there are plenty of fun, creative options. Classes range in difficulty, so there’s something for all skill levels.\n\n## Exercising with Friends\n\nWorking out with friends can be one of the best ways to stay motivated and make a workout fun. At the very least, you’ll encourage each other to show up and get started, which can be enough to help you get through the session. Plus, friends can provide the extra push you might need to try a new or challenging workout. Exercising with friends can take many forms, though. You can go for walks or runs together, go to the gym, attend a yoga or dance class, or even play a sport. It can be great to have other people who are working out alongside you nearby, but it’s also beneficial to have people you can go out of your way to hang out with and exercise with, too. It can make the experience more social and help you stay accountable for your regular workouts.\n\n## Get a Good Music Mix\n\nIf you love to dance and listen to music when you work out, great! If not, consider putting on a good music mix, especially if you’re doing an indoor workout. Music has several benefits for workouts, and it can make any exercise more fun. It can help you keep your rhythm while you exercise, and it can make you more likely to stick with your workout, according to research. It can also help you increase your intensity level, which can help you get better results. Make sure you choose the right music for your workout. Songs with a steady rhythm that aren’t too distracting are best. If you’re working out indoors, avoid songs with lyrics, as they can make it harder to stay in time with your exercises.\n\n## Set Realistic Goals for Yourself\n\nSometimes, the reason you hate working out is that you don’t see the point of it or it feels like a waste of time. If you don’t see a connection between your daily workout and the results you want, it can be hard to stay motivated. To make your workout more fun, set realistic goals for yourself that you can achieve in your workouts. Something as simple as increasing your speed or intensity level by a certain percentage each week can help you see the progress you’re making. This can help you feel like your workout is worth it, and it can even help you stay motivated to try new activities and exercise variations. Plus, the sooner you achieve your goals, the sooner you can start to enjoy the benefits of exercise.\n\n## Commit to Working Out for a Short Time Only\n\nIf you hate working out so much that you can’t imagine ever enjoying it, consider committing to a short workout only. For example, if you usually exercise for an hour three times per week, try committing to only doing it once a week for only 30 minutes. It might be easier to get yourself to show up for a shorter workout, and once you’re there, you might find you enjoy the experience more than you expected once you’re into it. Plus, short workouts are still beneficial. And once you’re used to exercising on a regular basis, you can always increase your time, frequency, or intensity as you progress. As long as you don’t make a habit of short workouts, you can also transition from short workouts to longer workouts as soon as you feel ready.\n\n## Go to the Gym When You’re Most Tired\n\nIf you don’t have enough energy or are feeling unmotivated, consider waiting until you feel more tired to go to the gym. Exercising when you’re tired can help you work out more intensely and break through plateaus. And while you might notice it’s harder, you might not realize how much stronger you’re getting. As a result, you may enjoy your workouts more once you start to notice your progress. Plus, a tired workout might be less boring and more challenging than a normal workout. If you’re feeling tired, consider doing something a little more challenging or interesting than you normally would. You might find it easier than you expected, and you can feel good knowing you pushed yourself harder than you would have if you were fully rested.\n\n## Watch Funny Videos Beforehand\n\nIf you’re having a hard time getting yourself motivated to workout, try watching a few funny videos beforehand. This can help get your mind off how you’re feeling and distract you enough to get you fired up. Plus, you might even find yourself laughing, which can help you break through mental barriers. The important thing is picking the right video. Make sure you don’t pick something that’s too silly or silly all the way through, or you won’t be able to focus on it. Instead, try for something funny, but with enough substance that you can also pay attention to it and get something out of it.\n\n## Don’t Compare Yourself to Others\n\nComparison can be a big reason why you don’t enjoy your workouts anymore. If you’re comparing yourself to others, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. If you don’t exercise as often, or as intensely as someone else, you’re likely not to see the same results. And even if you do exercise at the same intensity as someone else, your progress is going to depend on your nutrition and genetics, too. Try to avoid comparing yourself to others, and focus on your own progress and results. This will help you enjoy your workouts more, and you’ll be less likely to get discouraged.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nExercising is a great way to stay healthy and fit. But what if you hate to exercise? It can be hard to motivate yourself to go to the gym or go on a run when you don't really enjoy it. But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to make your workouts more fun so that you'll actually look forward to them. From trying a new exercise class to getting a good music mix and watching funny videos, there are plenty of ways to make your workouts more fun. So put on your favorite workout clothes, turn up your favorite playlist and get moving!"
