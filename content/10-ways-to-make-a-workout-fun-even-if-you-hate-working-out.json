Just make sure you do some research first, so you know what to expect and have a good idea of how challenging it will be.

At the very least, you\\u2019ll encourage each other to show up and get started, which can be enough to help you get through the session. Plus, friends can provide the extra push you might need to try a new or challenging workout. Exercising with friends can take many forms, though. You can go for walks or runs together, go to the gym, attend a yoga or dance class, or even play a sport. It can be great to have other people who are working out alongside you nearby, but it\\u2019s also beneficial to have people you can go out of your way to hang out with and exercise with, too.

It can help you keep your rhythm while you exercise, and it can make you more likely to stick with your workout, according to research. It can also help you increase your intensity level, which can help you get better results. Make sure you choose the right music for your workout.

To make your workout more fun, set realistic goals for yourself that you can achieve in your workouts. Something as simple as increasing your speed or intensity level by a certain percentage each week can help you see the progress you\\u2019re making.

It might be easier to get yourself to show up for a shorter workout, and once you\\u2019re there, you might find you enjoy the experience more than you expected once you\\u2019re into it. Plus, short workouts are still beneficial. And once you\\u2019re used to exercising on a regular basis, you can always increase your time, frequency, or intensity as you progress.

Plus, a tired workout might be less boring and more challenging than a normal workout.

The important thing is picking the right video. Make sure you don\\u2019t pick something that\\u2019s too silly or silly all the way through, or you won\\u2019t be able to focus on it.
