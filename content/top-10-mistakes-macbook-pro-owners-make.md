summary: Don’t run your Macbook Pro on the factory battery, not just those with
  Macbook Pros. You should always be aware of what you have running on your
  computer. Don't use a case with your laptop to protect it from being dropped
  or bumped without covering up the computer with a case. If you have too many
  apps running at once, it can really slow down the entire computer. It’s better
  to have a solid hard drive with plenty of storage on it if you do a lot of
  work with images or videos.

## Don’t store your laptop in sleep mode

This one is a common mistake among all laptop owners, not just those with Macbook Pros. It’s important to understand that when you store your laptop in sleep mode, it doesn’t completely shut down like you might think. What’s actually happening is that your laptop is saving the last state of what was on the screen at the time it entered sleep mode.
When you wake your computer back up from sleep mode, whatever was open when you last saved it will be reopened to where you left off. This is great if you were in the middle of working on a document and forgot to save it before you shut the computer down.
If you’re planning on storing your Macbook for a long period of time without using it, it’s best to shut the computer down instead of storing it in sleep mode.

## Don’t run your Macbook Pro on the factory battery

This mistake is a little different from the others on this list because it doesn’t really have anything to do with how you use the computer, it has to do with the type of battery you have inside your laptop. This mistake is commonly made by laptop owners who are looking for something more powerful than a standard battery.
When you buy a Macbook Pro, the battery that’s included is actually a lithium-polymer battery. This type of battery is very different from the standard lithium-ion battery that most other laptops have. The standard kind of lithium-ion battery can be charged up to around 2,000 times while lithium-polymer batteries can only be charged up to 500 times before they need to be replaced.
If you have one of these higher capacity batteries, you should be aware that it will wear down faster than a standard battery. It is recommended that you purchase a replacement battery after about 500 charges, which is about two years of normal use.

## Don’t have too many things running at once

This one is more of a general computer tip than one that is specific to Macbook Pro owners. Whenever you have too many apps running at once, it can really slow down the entire computer. Even if you have a powerful computer, if it’s overwhelmed with what it has to be doing, it will start to run slower.
You should always be aware of what you have running on your computer. This includes programs that you have open as well as apps that are constantly running in the background.
Don’t be afraid to close out of programs that you aren’t using to free up some processing power. You can also try going into the Activity Monitor to see which apps are using up the most resources so that you can close them out to free things up a bit.

## Don’t use a case with your Macbook Pro

This one is another one that you’ll want to be careful with if you find yourself a Macbook Pro owner. It’s common for people to put a case on their laptop to protect it from scratches and dents. While you definitely shouldn’t throw your computer around, you shouldn’t put a case on it either.
A case can hinder your computer from getting the airflow that it needs to stay cool while you’re using it. On top of that, it can trap heat inside the computer and build up inside.
Without proper ventilation, your computer will overheat which can cause damage to to the internal components.
If you’re someone who travels with your laptop often, it’s best to invest in a durable case that will protect it from being dropped or bumped without covering up the computer with a case.

## Don’t use cloud storage for processing intensive work with video and photos

This mistake is only really relevant if you’re an avid photographer or someone who edits a lot of pictures and video. If you find yourself doing a lot of image and video editing via your computer, there’s a good chance that you’ll be uploading and downloading files from cloud storage.
Don’t store these files in a cloud storage account. If you’re doing any kind of processing on these files, the cloud storage will slow down and even stop the flow of data to your computer.
The computers and servers used to host cloud storage accounts are shared amongst many people and the more data that is stored on these servers, the slower everything will go.
It’s better to have a solid hard drive with plenty of storage on it if you do a lot of work with images or videos. This will ensure that the computer’s processor can move as quickly as possible while you’re working.

## Do buy a quality mouse to go along with your Macbook Pro

If you’re a person who does a lot of work on the computer, it’s always a good idea to have a reliable mouse to go along with it.
Do not use the trackpad as a mouse. Doing so will cause you to press down on the trackpad with a lot more force than you need to which can lead to serious hand pain.
Don’t let the fact that you’re using a Macbook Pro stop you from buying a high-quality mouse. There are plenty of great options out there that will work well with your computer.

## Don’t use earbuds or headphones that aren’t high quality

If you’re someone who likes to listen to music on your computer while you work or edit, you should make sure that you have a solid pair of headphones or earbuds that you use while you work.
Do not use the speakers in your computer to listen to music while you work. This is a surefire way to build up a lot of unnecessary noise in your life and work environment.

## Do get a solid, reliable USB-C cable for charging and file transfers

If you’re buying a brand new Macbook Pro, you’ll notice that it comes with a USB-C cable. These cables are incredibly useful for charging your computer as well as transferring data from one device to another.
Despite how useful these cables are, they are also some of the most commonly used items when it comes to computer repair. If you experience any issues with your computer, there’s a good chance that the problem will be solved by replacing the cable.

A good cable can last for years, but a bad one can damage your computer in just a few months. To make sure you get a reliable cable, you should check out reviews before making a purchase. And remember to unplug the cable when you’re not using it to reduce the risk of damage.
