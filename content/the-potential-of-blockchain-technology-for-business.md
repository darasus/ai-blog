summary: A blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that record and
  verify transactions. Each computer has a list of all transactions that have
  occurred on the network since it was created. These computers also update
  everyone’s account balances to reflect the transaction. It can help businesses
  in essentially any industry track and resell their digital assets. There are
  many other ways to help businesses, including smart contracts, digital
  identity management, smart contracts and tracking assets with the help of the
  blockchain technology. The technology can help you create a decentralized
  database where you can track everything from items and software to employees
  and contractors.
intro: >-
  In the digital age, businesses need to create new digital assets faster
  and more efficiently than ever before. That’s because these assets are now the
  basis of most modern businesses and services. The value of these assets isn’t
  just in their practical use; it’s also in their resale potential, or secondary
  market value.

  Upgrading your business with blockchain technology can help you create, track, and resell your digital assets like never before. Blockchain is a decentralized network that creates a ledger of all transactions that are verified by members of the network. These networks are most commonly seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they have many other uses as well.

  Blockchain technology has the potential to streamline almost any industry, from finance to retail to even healthcare. If you want to know more about how blockchain can upgrade your business, keep reading for insight on the potential of blockchain technology for business.

## What is Blockchain and How Does it Work?

A blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that record and verify transactions. Each computer on the network has a list of all transactions that have occurred on the network since it was created. These computers also have a list of all the current account balances in the system. When someone initiates a transaction – like sending money or creating a digital asset – the transaction appears on all computers in the network.
The computers in the network then verify that the transaction is accurate and that the person initiating the transaction is allowed to do so. If everything checks out, the computers will add the new transaction to their list of transactions. The computers also update everyone’s account balances to reflect the transaction.

## How Can Blockchain Help Businesses?

Blockchain can help businesses in essentially any industry track and resell their digital assets. One of the most common examples is digital currencies like Bitcoin. By tracking the creation and distribution of these currencies, blockchain can make them more secure and less prone to fraud.
There are many other ways blockchain can help businesses, including:
- Asset tracking - If you’re creating a new product, it’s important to track its creation from start to finish. You need to know where the materials came from, who assembled the product, and where it went after it was shipped out. Blockchain can help you track all of this information, and then you can use the data for resale purposes.
- Smart contracts - Blockchain can also help you create smart contracts. These are contracts that are verified and enforced by the blockchain. That means the terms of the contract are set in code, and the blockchain will verify if they’ve been breached. It can help keep business deals fair and honest.
- Digital identity management - Blockchain also has the potential to help businesses create and maintain digital identities. This can help companies verify their identity and keep unwanted visitors out of their systems.

## Blockchain and the Art of Asset Tracking

Tracking assets is a crucial part of any business, especially when it comes to reselling them. If you’re a company like Tesla or Google, you might have millions of dollars in equipment on which you’ve put a considerable investment. When you’re done with the equipment, you need to know how to sell it.
Because you have so many assets, tracking them can be a challenge. You may have hundreds or thousands of computers, along with thousands of other items such as cars, furniture, or appliances. You may also have a variety of software assets, including server and network configurations, databases, and software code.
With blockchain technology, you can track all of these assets with ease. You can create a decentralized database where you can track everything from items and software to employees and contractors. And if you use smart contracts, you can even make your assets self-selling.

## Blockchain and the Resale of Digital Assets

One of the best ways to make money from your assets is to resell them. This can be especially useful when you want to upgrade your assets or when you no longer need them.
You can resell physical assets like cars, appliances, and furniture, but you can also resell digital assets like software. This is especially common in the tech world, where companies often have millions of dollars’ worth of software licenses that they no longer need.
To resell your assets, you typically need to keep track of what you have, where it is, and who owns it. This can be a challenging process, especially if you have a large amount of assets. If you don’t know where your assets are, it’s nearly impossible to resell them.

## Blockchain and the Resale of Digital Assets

Blockchain technology can help you create a decentralized database of all your assets, including physical and digital items. This database can include everything from a list of software licenses to the location of your company’s servers. You can also use blockchain to keep track of who owns an asset and transfer it to new owners when necessary.
When you’re ready to resell your assets, blockchain can help you keep track of their value, as well as your profit from previous sales. It can also help you transfer ownership of your assets to new owners.

## Blockchain in Finance

The finance industry is one of the most lucrative areas for blockchain. This is especially true with regard to cross-border payments, which can be extremely slow and costly.
In 2018, the average payment across borders took approximately two to five days to complete. It also cost $49 per payment and $18 per payment per million in the transaction volume.
This is because financial institutions often use a system called “nostro accounts” to transfer money between countries. This system requires banks to keep money in other banks around the world to make sure they have enough to cover international payments. This is why it can take so long to transfer money.
And why is blockchain a potential solution? Because it’s a decentralized network, blockchain can confirm transactions almost instantly. It doesn’t require banks to hold money in other banks, so it can complete transactions much more quickly.

## Blockchain in Supply Chain Management

Businesses that operate globally often have a complex supply chain that can span across the globe. And because this chain is often paper-based, it’s difficult to track from start to finish. You can have millions of dollars’ worth of supplies sitting in containers that may be in the wrong port or on the wrong truck.
You also can have millions of dollars’ worth of goods sitting in warehouses that aren’t being used because they aren’t where they’re supposed to be. And you can have employees filling out paper forms that are incredibly inefficient and prone to errors.
With blockchain technology, you can create a decentralized database of all goods in your supply chain. This will make it much easier to track your goods and make adjustments as necessary. It can also help you reduce waste and fraud.

## Conclusion

When businesses create new digital assets, they are also creating potential profit. The key is to keep track of those assets and know how to resell them. That’s where blockchain can help.
This technology is a decentralized network that makes it easier to track and resell your digital assets. Whether you’re creating software or managing goods in a supply chain, blockchain can make your business more efficient and profitable.
