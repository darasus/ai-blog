This method of resolving disputes with another party without going to court is becoming increasingly common. While mediation isn\\u2019t for everyone, there are some distinct advantages that it offers over traditional litigation.\nMediation allows you to resolve your dispute with another party in a private and confidential setting that\\u2019s neutral and objective. In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings. A mediated settlement is binding and requires no further action from either party after reaching an agreement.

The amount you spend on legal fees depends on a few factors, including: The type of dispute and the complexity of the issue, the number of parties involved in the legal action, the jurisdiction of the court in which your case is being heard, the length of time it takes to resolve your legal matter, the court fees and charges that apply to your case, and the amount of time it takes for you to be served with papers or for papers to be served on you.\nDepending on the nature of your dispute, you may or may not be required to pay court filing fees and other administrative costs, but it\\u2019s safe to assume that legal action is considerably expensive. In addition to the money you spend on your lawyer, you\\u2019ll also have to cover the other party\\u2019s legal costs as well as court fees. In mediation, there are no lawyers involved and no court costs. The only cost you\\u2019ll incur is the cost of the mediator.

In a mediated settlement, both parties are free to accept or reject an offer from the other party. Mediators aren\\u2019t empowered to make a binding decision like a judge. Instead, they facilitate discussion between both parties involved in a dispute. Mediators are trained to help both parties come to an agreement that both sides are happy with.

A dispute like this is called an \\u201Cinterstate\\u201D or \\u201Cdiversity\\u201D claim, meaning that the two parties involved in a dispute come from different states. If you want to go to court, you have to file your lawsuit in the state where the other party is based. This is called the \\u201Cseat\\u201D of the lawsuit. If the other party lives in California and you live in New York, you have to file your lawsuit in California because that\\u2019s where the other party lives. If you file your lawsuit in California, you\\u2019re at a disadvantage because the laws in California may be different than the laws in New York.

Mediation also has the potential to preserve your relationship with the other party after the dispute is resolved, which may prove useful if you anticipate interacting with that person again in the future.
