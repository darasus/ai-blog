This method of resolving disputes with another party without going to court is becoming increasingly common. While mediation isn\\u2019t for everyone, there are some distinct advantages that it offers over traditional litigation.\nMediation allows you to resolve your dispute with another party in a private and confidential setting that\\u2019s neutral and objective. In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings. A mediated settlement is binding and requires no further action from either party after reaching an agreement.

There are many different types of mediation, each with its own set of rules and expectations for participants. Understanding these variations is crucial to picking the right mediation process for your specific needs.\nMediation can be broadly divided into two categories: third-party mediation, where an impartial mediator helps parties reach agreement; and collaborative or problem-solving mediation, where the mediator acts as a guide who helps both parties negotiate in good faith and move towards a mutually beneficial solution.\nEach type of mediation has its own set of rules and requirements. In this blog post we\\u2019ll explore some of the most common forms of mediation, including general mediation, third-party neutral mediation, guided collaborative mediation, hybrid collaborative-neutral mediation and expert team services (ETS).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
