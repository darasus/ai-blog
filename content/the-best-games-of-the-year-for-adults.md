intro: >-
  Video games have come a long way in the past few years. And while some
  might assume that this means they’re now “grown up” or “intelligent” enough,
  the reality is that they are becoming more and more sophisticated at engaging
  players. With that being said, the video game market has seen a huge increase
  in popularity of games with an adult aesthetic.
   The best rated adult games have left behind the cartoonish characters and storylines of old, instead focusing on darker storylines and character development to keep players coming back for more. 
  That being said, there are plenty of great games out there that don’t shy away from their adult nature. If you’re looking for something new and exciting in 2019, check out these amazingly reviewed titles:

## The Last of Us Remastered

The Last of Us Remastered is arguably one of the best adult games out there. Set in a dystopian future where a fungal pandemic has left the world in a state of decay, the game follows Joel, a survivor who smuggles people in the black market. When he is hired to smuggle a young girl named Ellie out of the quarantine zone, however, things take a turn for the worst.
The Last of Us is a highly cinematic game that features some incredibly mature themes and relentless violence. Be warned, this is one that you won’t want to play if you’re under 18!

## GTA V

Grand Theft Auto V is a game that revels in its adult aesthetic. This open-world game sees players take control of three criminals who have just been released from prison. With the help of the Internet, the trio manage to track down the people who put them away and plan to get revenge.
GTA V has been praised for its incredible attention to detail and advanced physics system. There are few games that have left such an impact on the industry as this one, and it has gained immense popularity with adults and children alike.
GTA V is a game that can be enjoyed by all. Although it may be better suited to players who are 18 and over, it is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humour. If you are looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, this is one to consider.

## Shadow of the Colossus

Shadow of the Colossus is a game that follows a young man as he travels across a deserted landscape, searching for a magical sword. This sword, once plunged into the heart of a monstrous creature, will help him to save a young woman who has been infected by the same disease that has left the world barren and lifeless.
The game is a remake of a PlayStation 2 title, but has been completely remastered. It is a game that will appeal to players of all ages, but it is one that is best reserved for adults.
The game has been praised for its unique and artistic approach to storytelling and minimalist approach to game design. Although not everyone will appreciate its artistic style, Shadow of the Colossus is a game that will appeal to those who are after something unique and different.

## Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain

The Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain sees players take control of an army veteran who has been left injured after being betrayed by his comrades. After the betrayal, he goes into hiding, but is weakened by his injuries and needs to use a wheelchair.
The game features some mature themes and extreme violence, but it is one that has been acclaimed by gamers and critics alike.
The Phantom Pain was praised for its attention to detail and captivating story, but it is definitely one that is better suited to an older audience.

## Bioshock Infinite

Bioshock Infinite is a first-person shooter that has been praised for its mature themes and intelligent storyline. The game follows Booker DeWitt, who is sent to the floating city of Columbia to find a young woman who has been imprisoned by the city’s dictator.
The Bioshock series has always been praised for its dark and cinematic storylines, but this one is definitely one that is best reserved for adults.
The Bioshock series has a habit of exploring mature themes, and Bioshock Infinite is no exception. While it is a great game in its own right, it is one that is best enjoyed by those who are 18 and over.
