intro: >-
  Video games have come a long way in the past few years. And while some
  might assume that this means they’re now “grown up” or “intelligent” enough,
  the reality is that they are becoming more and more sophisticated at engaging
  players. With that being said, the video game market has seen a huge increase
  in popularity of games with an adult aesthetic.
   The best rated adult games have left behind the cartoonish characters and storylines of old, instead focusing on darker storylines and character development to keep players coming back for more. 
  That being said, there are plenty of great games out there that don’t shy away from their adult nature. If you’re looking for something new and exciting in 2019, check out these amazingly reviewed titles:

When he is hired to smuggle a young girl named Ellie out of the quarantine zone, however, things take a turn for the worst.
The Last of Us is a highly cinematic game that features some incredibly mature themes and relentless violence. Be warned, this is one that you won’t want to play if you’re under 18!

## GTA V

## Shadow of the Colossus

Shadow of the Colossus is a game that follows a young man as he travels across a deserted landscape, searching for a magical sword.
