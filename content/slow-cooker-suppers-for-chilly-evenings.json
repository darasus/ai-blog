These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis. A diet rich in omega-3 fats may also play a role in preventing depression, ADLs (age-related decline in activities of daily living), and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.
