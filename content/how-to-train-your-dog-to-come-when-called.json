You can start by standing far away from your dog when you call him. If your dog is closer to you, he will have a much easier time getting to you. You can also start with a long leash, so that your dog has to go through the effort of running to get to you. You can also do both, standing far away from your dog with a long leash. This way, your dog has to run towards you and will understand that coming is a challenge.

Make sure you use a good quality leash that is long enough so that your dog has enough room to come to you without choking himself. A standard leash length is between 6 and 10 feet. If your dog is inside, you can begin by having a long leash attached to his collar, so that he can freely walk around the house. If your dog is already outside on a long leash, you can start by calling him to you.

If you try again after a day or two, your dog might just \\u2018get it\\u2019 the second time around. If your dog still doesn\\u2019t get it after a few tries, try to change the way you are training him.

This means giving your dog a reward for completing a certain action. The reward can be anything your dog likes, but it is important that you use it consistently every time so that your dog associates it with the action he just completed. Ideally, the reward should be something you can use during training, like a treat or a favourite toy. This will help strengthen your dog\\u2019s association between coming when called and receiving a reward, making it easier for him to learn this command.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to teach your dog to come when called using positive reinforcement is to start with short distance training.

This can sometimes make the training more challenging, but don\\u2019t give up! The next time you call your dog, give him a reward.

If something isn\\u2019t working, try something else until you find a method that works best for you and your dog. You can\\u2019t expect results overnight, but with enough practice, your dog will come when called, and you\\u2019ll be one step closer to having a well-trained dog.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This method of resolving disputes with another party without going to court is becoming increasingly common. While mediation isn\\u2019t for everyone, there are some distinct advantages that it offers over traditional litigation.\nMediation allows you to resolve your dispute with another party in a private and confidential setting that\\u2019s neutral and objective. In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings. A mediated settlement is binding and requires no further action from either party after reaching an agreement. If you\\u2019re currently involved in a legal dispute, here are three reasons why mediation may be beneficial for you:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
