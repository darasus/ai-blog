You can start by standing far away from your dog when you call him. If your dog is closer to you, he will have a much easier time getting to you. You can also start with a long leash, so that your dog has to go through the effort of running to get to you. You can also do both, standing far away from your dog with a long leash. This way, your dog has to run towards you and will understand that coming is a challenge. Once your dog gets the hang of coming to you when you call him, you can start closing the gap between you two and bringing the leash back to normal length.

This way, your dog can get used to the motion of coming towards you and will be less likely to get distracted. Make sure you use a good quality leash that is long enough so that your dog has enough room to come to you without choking himself. A standard leash length is between 6 and 10 feet. If your dog is inside, you can begin by having a long leash attached to his collar, so that he can freely walk around the house. If your dog is already outside on a long leash, you can start by calling him to you. You can also try walking towards your dog to see how he reacts to you getting closer to him.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t give up!\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While training your dog to come when called, you might find that he doesn\\u2019t get it the first time you try.

If you try again after a day or two, your dog might just \\u2018get it\\u2019 the second time around. If your dog still doesn\\u2019t get it after a few tries, try to change the way you are training him. Think about what you are doing and if there is anything you can do differently to make the training easier for your dog.

This means giving your dog a reward for completing a certain action. The reward can be anything your dog likes, but it is important that you use it consistently every time so that your dog associates it with the action he just completed. Ideally, the reward should be something you can use during training, like a treat or a favourite toy. This will help strengthen your dog\\u2019s association between coming when called and receiving a reward, making it easier for him to learn this command.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to teach your dog to come when called using positive reinforcement is to start with short distance training.

The first time you call your dog, don\\u2019t give him a reward. Your dog will be confused when he comes towards you because he won\\u2019t know he did something right. This can sometimes make the training more challenging, but don\\u2019t give up! The next time you call your dog, give him a reward. Make sure you only reward him when he comes towards you and not when he runs towards you.

The more consistent you are with training, the quicker your dog will learn. Remember to keep things positive and consistent. If something isn\\u2019t working, try something else until you find a method that works best for you and your dog. You can\\u2019t expect results overnight, but with enough practice, your dog will come when called, and you\\u2019ll be one step closer to having a well-trained dog.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
