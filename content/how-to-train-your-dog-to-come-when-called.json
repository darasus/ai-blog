This way, your dog has to run towards you and will understand that coming is a challenge.

If your dog is inside, you can begin by having a long leash attached to his collar, so that he can freely walk around the house.

This means giving your dog a reward for completing a certain action. The reward can be anything your dog likes, but it is important that you use it consistently every time so that your dog associates it with the action he just completed. Ideally, the reward should be something you can use during training, like a treat or a favourite toy.

This can sometimes make the training more challenging, but don\\u2019t give up! The next time you call your dog, give him a reward.
