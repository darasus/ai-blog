If not, are you looking for a way to improve? Coming when called is an essential command that most pet owners neglect.

This will help keep your dog safe, especially if he\\u2019s prone to running away or chasing objects or other animals. It also helps with training and makes everyday interactions much easier than having to constantly chase after your pet.\nBut perhaps the most important reason why you should train your dog to come when called is because it might just save his life one day. In many cases, dogs that run away don\\u2019t get lost, they are just trying to find a way back home.

Most experts will tell you that it is best to start this training as early as possible, preferably when your dog is still a puppy. Apart from the fact that puppies are easier to train, this is a skill that you can use for the rest of your dog\\u2019s life. If you have an older dog, don\\u2019t worry, it\\u2019s never too late to start training him. With the right approach and some consistency, you can train your dog to come when called at any age.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The next thing you need to do is select the right location to begin training. It is best to start indoors, so that your dog doesn\\u2019t get distracted by other animals or things he might find outside. You can also begin indoors if your dog is in a crate. Outside, there is too much for him to focus on and he may find something else to chase, like birds or squirrels. If you begin indoors, you can slowly move outside once your dog masters this command. \"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t make it too easy\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This might seem counterintuitive, but when training your dog to come when called, you don\\u2019t want to make it too easy. You should actually make it a challenge for your dog to come to you when you call him. This will train him to not just come, but to run towards you. If you call your dog and he just casually walks towards you, it means he\\u2019s not running towards you, which isn\\u2019t ideal in an emergency situation when you need your dog to quickly get to you.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"There are a few ways to make it a challenge for your dog to come to you when you call him. You can start by standing far away from your dog when you call him. If your dog is closer to you, he will have a much easier time getting to you. You can also start with a long leash, so that your dog has to go through the effort of running to get to you. You can also do both, standing far away from your dog with a long leash. This way, your dog has to run towards you and will understand that coming is a challenge. Once your dog gets the hang of coming to you when you call him, you can start closing the gap between you two and bringing the leash back to normal length. The point of making it harder for your dog to come to you is to train him to run towards you when you call him.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Start with a long leash\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When you begin training your dog to come when called, you should start with a long leash. This way, your dog can get used to the motion of coming towards you and will be less likely to get distracted. Make sure you use a good quality leash that is long enough so that your dog has enough room to come to you without choking himself. A standard leash length is between 6 and 10 feet. If your dog is inside, you can begin by having a long leash attached to his collar, so that he can freely walk around the house. If your dog is already outside on a long leash, you can start by calling him to you. You can also try walking towards your dog to see how he reacts to you getting closer to him.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Don\\u2019t give up!\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While training your dog to come when called, you might find that he doesn\\u2019t get it the first time you try. Don\\u2019t give up on training your dog too soon. If your dog doesn\\u2019t get it after a few times, you can try again another day. Every dog is different and learns at their own pace. If you try again after a day or two, your dog might just \\u2018get it\\u2019 the second time around. If your dog still doesn\\u2019t get it after a few tries, try to change the way you are training him. Think about what you are doing and if there is anything you can do differently to make the training easier for your dog. If you are consistent in your training, your dog will learn this command eventually.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Teaching your dog to come when called using positive reinforcement\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the best ways to train your dog to come when called is to use positive reinforcement. This means giving your dog a reward for completing a certain action. The reward can be anything your dog likes, but it is important that you use it consistently every time so that your dog associates it with the action he just completed. Ideally, the reward should be something you can use during training, like a treat or a favourite toy. This will help strengthen your dog\\u2019s association between coming when called and receiving a reward, making it easier for him to learn this command.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The best way to teach your dog to come when called using positive reinforcement is to start with short distance training. This means calling your dog to you from a short distance away. This is a good way to start because your dog will be less likely to get distracted or try to run away. The first time you call your dog, don\\u2019t give him a reward. Your dog will be confused when he comes towards you because he won\\u2019t know he did something right. This can sometimes make the training more challenging, but don\\u2019t give up! The next time you call your dog, give him a reward. Make sure you only reward him when he comes towards you and not when he runs towards you. If you reward your dog when he runs towards you, it will encourage him to chase things, which is not ideal.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"You can\\u2019t expect your dog to come when called when he has never been trained to do so. This is a skill that needs to be taught and practiced over time. The more you practice, the better your dog will get at coming when called. The more consistent you are with training, the quicker your dog will learn. Remember to keep things positive and consistent. If something isn\\u2019t working, try something else until you find a method that works best for you and your dog. You can\\u2019t expect results overnight, but with enough practice, your dog will come when called, and you\\u2019ll be one step closer to having a well-trained dog.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
