Eating quickly can increase feelings of hunger and overeating, plus it’s associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Eating more fibre can help to reduce hunger, improve digestive issues and reduce feelings of anxiety and make it more likely to turn to food again when you’re not hungry.
