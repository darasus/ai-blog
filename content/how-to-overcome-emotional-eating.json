  "summary": "You can start by creating a daily meal ritual that helps you to break the cycle of emotional eating and put you in a better mindset for making healthier food choices. Eating quickly can increase feelings of hunger and overeating, plus it’s associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Eating more fibre can help to reduce hunger, improve digestive issues and reduce feelings of anxiety and make it more likely to turn to food again when you’re not hungry. Eating slowly can help you to savour your food, be more mindful and help prevent overeating.",
