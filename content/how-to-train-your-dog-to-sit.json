How about your dog? Dogs love to chew. It\\u2019s something that comes naturally for them, and there are many things you can buy or make that will help satisfy their natural instincts to chew. But as much as dogs love to have objects that they can gnaw on, it\\u2019s not always safe \\u2013 or advisable \\u2013 to let them do it in the home. There are plenty of household items that dogs shouldn\\u2019t be allowed to chew, because it could lead to potential hazards or unsanitary conditions.\nEven if your dog has never chewed on inappropriate things before, a new puppy will almost certainly try out things beyond what is safe for him. How you train him from the very beginning will determine how much damage he can do if he goes after something he shouldn\\u2019t.
