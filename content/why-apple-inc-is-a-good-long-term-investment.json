When asked about tariffs and their impact on prices, Apple executives again pivoted to discussing how much they loved iPhone and what a great product it was for customers.\nThat may sound weird for a company that makes a range of other products, but when you look at how much emphasis Apple has placed on its flagship smartphone in recent years, it starts to make sense.
