A big reason for this is that software designers are paying more attention to users\\u2019 experience. Instead of spending hours on making designs, they are investing more time on designing user experiences. User interfaces play a vital role in how an application is perceived by its target audience.\nA user interface consists of the various screens or windows that provide access to information, or enable actions such as viewing, creating, saving, and opening files. A user interface also includes the visual properties (such as colors, fonts, and graphics) and navigational components (such as menus, buttons, and tabs) that users see and interact with when using a computer program.\nIn this blog post we will learn about JavaServer Faces; what it is; why you might use it; and finally a brief introduction to its key concepts.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
