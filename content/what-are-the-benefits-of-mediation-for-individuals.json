Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company.

Heck, most dogs will go their entire lives without ever picking something up and then purposefully putting it somewhere else.\nIf you want to train your dog to drop something on command, you\\u2019ll need to focus a bit on simple tricks like that. After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
