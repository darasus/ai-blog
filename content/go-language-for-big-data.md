  Today we see businesses around the world struggling to adopt emerging
  technology and adapt to changing market conditions. As a result, many
  companies are facing a period of digital transformation that will either put
  them at an advantage or leave them obsolete. In today’s data-driven world,
  businesses must have the technology infrastructure in place to collect,
  process, analyze, and store massive amounts of data. 

  To remain competitive, organizations need software development strategies that can handle big data efficiently while keeping costs low. Organizations must also have the ability to implement new technologies quickly and integrate them into their existing systems.

## What Is Go?

Go is an open source programming language created by Google in 2007. It is statically typed, compiled, and it targets a wide variety of platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and even mobile devices. Go is known for its simplicity, clarity, and efficiency. This made it a language of choice for many developers looking to create microservices or write backend applications that integrate with other systems. Go is a general-purpose programming language that can be applied to solve many problems. It’s not optimized for any particular use case. This makes it a great choice for a variety of applications. The language has been gaining popularity over the last few years due to the increase in its adoption by tech companies. Some of the most notable companies that use Go include Google, Dropbox, and Uber.

## Why Go For Big Data?

Companies that depend on large data sets to operate need software that can handle those data efficiently. This can be tricky since big data is often unstructured and changes frequently. Many programming languages were designed for smaller data sets and are not efficient for analyzing big data. Go was designed to efficiently handle large data sets and work with unstructured data. Go is compiled and statically typed, which means the compiler can catch errors earlier in the development process. This and its efficient use of resources makes the language well suited for the challenges of big data.

Although Go has been used in the data science space for some time, it has recently seen an increase in adoption by data engineers. This is due to the language’s simplicity, performance, and its strong communities. These have made Go a great option for companies looking to create software that can handle large data sets.

## How is go better for big data?

To better understand how Go is better for big data, it’s important to first understand how languages work for big data. Larger data sets often require distributed systems built around a concept called parallel programming. Parallel programming is the concurrent execution of code across multiple processors. This is necessary to collect, process, and store large data sets efficiently. Parallel programming is usually achieved through specialized languages designed for distributed systems. These languages can be challenging to learn and implement in production. Go was designed for distributed systems from the start. This makes it an easy choice for companies looking for a language for big data.

Go makes it easier to handle unstructured data, which is common in big data sets. With integrated support for things like Unicode and data structures, Go makes it much simpler to organize and interpret large amounts of data. This makes it easier to collect data and access it at the same time.

## Go introduces great flexibility in code structuring

This is one of the biggest advantages of choosing Go as a language for big data. Go offers a variety of ways to handle code structuring. This flexibility allows companies to adopt a style they feel is best for their team. Go’s approach to structuring code makes it easier to collect, process, and store large data sets.

Go’s built-in support for concurrency makes it easier to handle large amounts of data at once. Concurrency allows you to run processes simultaneously and make use of more resources than one computer alone can provide. This is especially useful for tasks that need to process large amounts of data.

Go’s built-in support for distributed systems makes it easier for companies to scale. Distributed systems make it possible to break large tasks into smaller parts and run them across multiple computers. This makes it easier to process large data sets without needing a supercomputer.

## Go is fast, even for big data sets

Go’s performance has always been one of the languages biggest selling points. The language was made to be fast, even when dealing with large data sets.
In fact, Go’s creator has a benchmarking website where developers can test their code and compare it with other languages. The results show that Go is one of the fastest languages for processing big data.
This is due to the language’s simplicity, which removes unnecessary elements that make code slower.

The single-threaded nature of Go can be a downside for some organizations. However, this is not as big of a problem as it once was due to improvements in threading. Go 18 introduced an amazing new function to simplify concurrency called “channel”. Besides, the rise of cloud computing and serverless architecture has removed the need for parallel programming altogether. The fact that data is stored in the cloud means that it is a centralized location that can be accessed by one request at a time.

## Conclusion

The data-driven economy is a new reality in which businesses must collect, process, and store large amounts of data. Go was designed to handle these demands and can be a great choice for tackling big data.

The flexibility in code structuring, built-in performance, and easy deployment make Go a great option for companies looking to collect, process, and store large data sets.
