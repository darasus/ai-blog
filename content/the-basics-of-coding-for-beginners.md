As such, coding is very useful for programmers and software engineers, but it can also help people in other fields.

Even if you’re not interested in a career that uses coding, learning the basics can help you understand how computers and websites/apps work. This knowledge can come in handy when you need to troubleshoot a problem or when you want to create your own website.
