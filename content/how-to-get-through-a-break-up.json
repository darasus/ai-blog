It\\u2019s great that they want to explore the world around them and make new discoveries every day, but what isn\\u2019t so great is when they keep you up at night with their shenanigans. Doggy antics like sneaking out of their kennel, chewing on shoes, digging through the trash, or getting into a fight with another dog are all signs that your pup needs more structured activities. They may be natural predators who thrive on action and excitement, but dogs also need rest to maintain their mental and physical health.\nIf you want to give your dog a happy and healthy life, teaching them to go to bed is an excellent first step. All dogs have instincts which tell them when it\\u2019s time to rest and regenerate energy for another day out in the wild. But domesticated dogs have lost some of these instincts as a result of living in human company. Fortunately, training your dog to go to bed is fairly easy with some dedication from you!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

These are images that have been shared on social media sites and printed on t-shirts and posters across the globe. And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there\\u2019s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
