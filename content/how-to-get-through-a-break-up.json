In mediation, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates discussions between the two parties involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Mediators do not take sides; they remain neutral while guiding the discussion toward a resolution that both parties can accept.\nA successful mediation process allows both parties to save face by avoiding public disclosure of their personal information or confidential information about their business dealings.

From concerns over online safety to the amount of time kids spend looking at screens, digital parenting presents its own unique set of challenges.\nAs technology continues to advance, so do the ways in which our kids can interact with it. From tablets and smart TVs to smartphones and video games, it seems as though there are more screens than ever before. This is especially true for younger children who have grown up with these devices as a normal part of their everyday life.\nThe pros and cons of screen time for kids can be debated endlessly but at the end of the day, your child will likely spend a lot of their time consuming some form of media in one way or another. As their parent, it\\u2019s important that you understand the benefits and risks associated with screen time so that you can make informed decisions about how much exposure they receive on a regular basis.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like \\u201Csit\\u201D or \\u201Cstay,\\u201D or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard.
