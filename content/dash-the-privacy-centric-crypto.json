It is also one of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world. Dash was originally known as Darkcoin and was rebranded in 2015. The \\u201CDash\\u201D in the name is a portmanteau that is short for \\u201CDigital Cash.\\u201D The original goal of the coin was to provide a form of digital cash that could be sent online and would not be as easily traceable as traditional online payment methods. But what is most eye-catching about this coin is its current market cap, which sits at around $4 billion as of July 2018.

People have the right to transact to their heart\\u2019s content, without fear that their information will be used against them. The use of privacy-driven coins is the digital equivalent of paying in cash, which is a method that many people around the world use to shield themselves from fraud and other nefarious forces. Crypto is often heralded as a borderless and frictionless form of currency. Crypto transactions are quick, easy, and relatively cheap, but they are highly traceable. By default, most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are public and transparent. This means that anyone with access to the blockchain can see the entire transaction history of a particular address, including the amount sent, the amount received, and the addresses of the sending and receiving parties. This is a useful feature for law enforcement and other government agencies who want to track illicit activities, but it is a huge privacy concern for the average investor.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Problem with Privacy in Crypto\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Traditional cryptocurrencies are highly transparent, which means that anyone can see the public ledger of all transactions associated with a particular address. This is a huge problem, as it allows anyone with access to the blockchain to uncover a wealth of private information. This includes the addresses associated with past and present crypto holders, the amount they have spent or received, the exact time of all transactions, the amount of a particular transaction, the blockchain explorer or monitoring service used, and a host of other information. While this transparency is helpful for government agencies and other watchdogs who want to track down illicit activities, it is a huge problem for cryptocurrency investors. It is not illegal to invest in cryptocurrency, but it is also not 100% legal. Depending on where you live, cryptocurrency is either unregulated, partially regulated, or fully banned. Because of this, investors are often targeted by law enforcement agencies who want to track down people who engage in illegal activities using cryptocurrency. Many governments also have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, meaning that investors who want to transact or exchange crypto are required to provide proof of identification to protect against money laundering.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Dash Increases Privacy for Users\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The privacy-driven nature of Dash is what makes it such a compelling investment option for those who want to keep their transaction history as private as possible.

We have seen numerous companies launch blockchain-based products in various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, education, real estate and more. While this is great news for the adoption of this disruptive technology, investors are cautious about blockchain-based startups.\nNot just because their track record so far has not been great but also because these new ventures face an uphill battle to get funded and succeed. The existing capital is mostly going towards internet of things (IoT) startups, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and drones.\nBut that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s the end of road for blockchain technology in startups. In this blog post, we will explore why investors are skittish about blockchain-based startups right now and how you can help change that trend by launching one yourself.

Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server.
