It is also one of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world. Dash was originally known as Darkcoin and was rebranded in 2015. The \\u201CDash\\u201D in the name is a portmanteau that is short for \\u201CDigital Cash.\\u201D The original goal of the coin was to provide a form of digital cash that could be sent online and would not be as easily traceable as traditional online payment methods. But what is most eye-catching about this coin is its current market cap, which sits at around $4 billion as of July 2018. There are a total of 18.9 million Dash tokens in existence, which are broken down into two different categories:\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"45% of the tokens are owned by the Dash network itself, and are intended to fund future development and incentivize participation in the network.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"The remaining tokens are owned by investors, with the exact breakdown of the distribution of ownership depending on the current market price.\")),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Why is Privacy Important in a Crypto Investment?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In a digital age where your every transaction is tracked, privacy is a rare and extremely important commodity.

People have the right to transact to their heart\\u2019s content, without fear that their information will be used against them. The use of privacy-driven coins is the digital equivalent of paying in cash, which is a method that many people around the world use to shield themselves from fraud and other nefarious forces. Crypto is often heralded as a borderless and frictionless form of currency. Crypto transactions are quick, easy, and relatively cheap, but they are highly traceable. By default, most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are public and transparent. This means that anyone with access to the blockchain can see the entire transaction history of a particular address, including the amount sent, the amount received, and the addresses of the sending and receiving parties. This is a useful feature for law enforcement and other government agencies who want to track illicit activities, but it is a huge privacy concern for the average investor.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The Problem with Privacy in Crypto\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Traditional cryptocurrencies are highly transparent, which means that anyone can see the public ledger of all transactions associated with a particular address. This is a huge problem, as it allows anyone with access to the blockchain to uncover a wealth of private information. This includes the addresses associated with past and present crypto holders, the amount they have spent or received, the exact time of all transactions, the amount of a particular transaction, the blockchain explorer or monitoring service used, and a host of other information. While this transparency is helpful for government agencies and other watchdogs who want to track down illicit activities, it is a huge problem for cryptocurrency investors. It is not illegal to invest in cryptocurrency, but it is also not 100% legal. Depending on where you live, cryptocurrency is either unregulated, partially regulated, or fully banned. Because of this, investors are often targeted by law enforcement agencies who want to track down people who engage in illegal activities using cryptocurrency. Many governments also have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, meaning that investors who want to transact or exchange crypto are required to provide proof of identification to protect against money laundering.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How Dash Increases Privacy for Users\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The privacy-driven nature of Dash is what makes it such a compelling investment option for those who want to keep their transaction history as private as possible.
