summary: There are several ways to make your dog more aware of what’s off
  limits. The “Leave It” command is simple enough that even young puppies can
  learn it and understand it. Reward and games are another excellent way to
  train your dog and get him used to being around your things without touching
  them. Remember that training your dog to leave things alone won’t happen
  overnight. Like humans, dogs also have to learn as they go, and they’re bound
  to make mistakes along the way.
intro: >-
  Perhaps the most frustrating thing about owning a dog is that your house
  can never really be your own again. Fussing and fuming won’t make them any
  less likely to follow you anywhere, or to notice that bag of chips you just
  carelessly threw on the table. Dogs are dogs, which means they will follow
  your slightest lead and chip in with their two cents at every opportunity.
  Sadly, this also means that it’s not uncommon for dogs to get into things they
  shouldn’t. You like peace and quiet? Not so much when there’s a dog around.
  You like keeping your things? Good luck with that. 

  But luckily, with some bit of training and persistence, you can teach your pup exactly what’s off limits and exactly where to leave it instead. Best of all, all these tricks take very little time and effort on our part. It doesn’t have to be hard! Let’s check out how!

## Rule 1: Have A Dinner Party

Dogs love food, and if they’ve learned that food is off limits, they’re bound to get curious. Now, you don’t want your dog to get sick, but you also don’t want him to get into any trouble. There are several ways to make your dog more aware of what’s off limits. One of the easiest is to invite a few friends over for a dinner party. Why? Because, at a dinner party, almost everything is off limits. You want to keep your dog away from the food and drinks, of course, but you also want to keep him away from the tablecloth, the flowers on the table, and any other potential trouble.

## Rule 2: Use a “Leave It” Command

Another easy and effective way to train your dog is by introducing a “Leave it” command. How does it work? Well, every time your dog starts to get curious about something, you simply use this command. If your dog starts mouthing your couch, for example, you can use the command “Leave it.” If your dog starts digging in the dirt, you can use the same command. The “Leave it” command is simple enough that even young puppies can learn it and understand it! Once your dog knows the command and has started to get used to obeying it, you can also add a hand signal to make things even more clear.

## Rule 3: Use Rewards And Games To Train Your Dog

Rewards and games are another excellent way to train your dog and get him used to being around your things without touching them. If your dog starts getting curious about something, try giving him a toy or a treat to get his mind off of it. If he starts to get too excited, clap your hands and tell him “No.” You can even use the same toys to teach your dog that certain things are off limits. If, for example, your dog keeps getting excited about your old sneakers, put them in a toy. Your dog will have fun trying to get the shoes out, and he’ll learn that they’re not something he should be mouthing.

## Rule 4: Teach Your Dog About Touching Things

Now, some things are just going to be off limits. For example, you don’t want your dog to eat your birthday cake, no matter how much he might want to. You don’t want him to get too close to the stove, either. But you don’t want him to be afraid of his own birthday present, so you have to find a way to teach him about touching things. The first thing you should do is to make sure that your dog has plenty of space and something to chew on. Rawhides, for example, are great for dogs, and they’re safe enough to leave around your house. If your dog has his own toys, he’ll be less likely to go digging in your stuff. You can also try spraying things like the stove and the kitchen table with a water bottle. That’ll let your dog know that it’s not okay to come too close.

## Rule 5: Be Patient & Stick With It

Finally, remember that training your dog to leave things alone won’t happen overnight. Like humans, dogs also have to learn as they go, and they’re bound to make mistakes along the way. That’s not a bad thing, though. Mistakes are actually how dogs learn. If your dog makes a mistake, don’t get mad. Instead, let him know that he did something wrong and try again. Let’s say your dog is chewing on your couch, for example. Instead of getting mad, just get his attention and say “Off.” And if he keeps chewing on the couch, try spraying it with water. If your dog doesn’t learn to leave things alone, you might find yourself hating house parties and having to keep your things out of sight at all times. So, let your dog in on the fun by teaching him to leave things alone!
