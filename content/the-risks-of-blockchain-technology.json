However, that reputation isn\\u2019t necessarily fair. The real risk lies in how companies implement blockchain instead of the technology itself.\nThere are potential risks when adopting new technologies such as blockchain; however, implementing it correctly can help your business thrive by streamlining processes and reducing costs.

Because of this structure, anyone can see and access that data. That means that even if you use blockchain to store sensitive data, the confidentiality will be compromised.\nIf you need to store sensitive data in a blockchain, you\\u2019ll need to use a private or permissioned blockchain.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores data on a network of computers. As a result, the data is replicated across multiple locations. This is a huge benefit because if one computer on the network goes down the others can continue to operate without interruption. However, this also means that the data on these computers will not be as accurate as data on a centralized server.\nIf you\\u2019re storing critical data on a blockchain, you\\u2019ll need to make sure the others are accurately recording the information.

Many industries have strict regulations about storing data in certain areas. While blockchain technology can help improve data storage, it can also be a risk to the environment if not implemented correctly.\nWhen computers store data on a blockchain, they\\u2019re using a lot of energy. This is because computers are constantly checking and verifying each transaction on the network. If you\\u2019re using blockchain to monitor and store data from multiple sources, those computers will require a significant amount of energy.\nBecause data is stored on a blockchain network, your business will be responsible for this energy usage.
