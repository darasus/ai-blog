This is because computers are constantly checking and verifying each transaction on the network. If you\\u2019re using blockchain to monitor and store data from multiple sources, those computers will require a significant amount of energy.\nBecause data is stored on a blockchain network, your business will be responsible for this energy usage.

Individuals, businesses and even governments are becoming increasingly wary of giving third parties access to their confidential information. This mistrust is understandable, given the potential for cybercriminals to monetize user data for nefarious purposes. As such, there has been a marked interest in technologies that can facilitate the storage and sharing of data while also ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.\nTo that end, blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for improving how we manage confidential data. In this blog post, we will explore how blockchain technology can help businesses reduce the risk of cyberattacks by securing user data on an individual level rather than a centralized server. Furthermore, we\\u2019ll discuss why blockchain technology is particularly well suited to meet this challenge with enhanced security measures and increased transparency.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But few digital solutions are as effective and game-changing as blockchain technology. Blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger that records transactions chronologically and publicly, so that users can verify them. This process eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Blockchain technology also has other benefits, including faster transactions and greater transparency.  Moreover, it has the potential to reshape industries from finance to logistics, healthcare and beyond. The widespread adoption of blockchain represents a major innovation in computer science, with implications for almost every industry sector \\u2014 including insurance.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It brought about a new wave of decentralized applications that no one could have imagined in the early days of cryptocurrency. Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future. Below you will find all you need to know about Ethereum Classic, how it differs from \"new\" Ethereum, and how you can buy ETC.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
