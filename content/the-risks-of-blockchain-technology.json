The prevalence of centralized exchanges and custodial services, as well as recent price manipulation, have raised serious trust issues among users and potential users of the virtual currency.\nMoreover, with institutions, governments and individuals increasingly recognizing the value of digital tokens, crypto-anarchists are becoming concerned that Bitcoin may not be sufficiently anonymous to protect against intrusion from authorities or intermediaries (e.g., exchanges and data brokers).

As they are essentially software programs, new cryptocurrencies can be created at any time by anyone with the knowledge required to do so. These can range from small changes to major updates like Ethereum's switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake mining.\nThere are a number of factors that could continue to drive demand for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
