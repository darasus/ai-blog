Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores data on a network of computers. As a result, the data is replicated across multiple locations.

However, this also means that the data on these computers will not be as accurate as data on a centralized server.\nIf you\\u2019re storing critical data on a blockchain, you\\u2019ll need to make sure the others are accurately recording the information.

While blockchain technology can help improve data storage, it can also be a risk to the environment if not implemented correctly.\nWhen computers store data on a blockchain, they\\u2019re using a lot of energy. This is because computers are constantly checking and verifying each transaction on the network. If you\\u2019re using blockchain to monitor and store data from multiple sources, those computers will require a significant amount of energy.\nBecause data is stored on a blockchain network, your business will be responsible for this energy usage.
