summary: Blockchains are encrypted, distributed ledgers that use a consensus
  mechanism to verify and validate transactions. They can be open (public) or
  closed (private) Blockchains can be used to record financial transactions, or
  other types of transactions that require integrity and authentication. The
  decentralized networks of blockchain can process data significantly faster
  than traditional networks because it doesn’t have to be approved by a single
  authority. In order to realize these benefits, businesses will need to fully
  embrace blockchain as a core part of their operations.
intro: >-
  The world is becoming increasingly digital and connected. As a result,
  businesses and consumers alike are recognizing the potential of Smart
  Technologies. Organizations are looking to implement new solutions that can
  streamline operations, cut costs, and drive innovation. In response to this
  growing demand for Smart Technology, blockchain is emerging as a promising
  solution.

  Crypto-currencies like Bitcoin have received a lot of attention recently because they use blockchain technology as their foundation – something called a “proof-of-work” mechanism that validates transactions on the network through verification by many different users. The implications of blockchain go far beyond just these applications though, extending into almost every industry. In this blog post we will explore the opportunities that come from integrating blockchain in your business processes or software development life cycle (SDLC).

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is used to record transactions across many different systems. Blockchains are the foundation of many crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchains are encrypted, distributed ledgers that use a consensus mechanism to verify and validate transactions. They can be open (public) or closed (private), and they can be used to record financial transactions, or other types of transactions that require integrity and authentication.

## Why is blockchain so promising?

Blockchain provides three core benefits that are driving its adoption across industries. First, it offers trust by enabling transparency across the network. This can be especially valuable in supply chains where the entire journey of a product or shipment can be authenticated. Second, it offers collaboration between partners. Rather than requiring multiple organizations to operate on the same network, blockchains can be implemented as a private blockchain that allows partners to authenticate their transactions with one another. This can be especially helpful in the healthcare industry where data needs to be shared securely between different organizations. Finally, blockchain offers speed. The decentralized networks of blockchain can process data significantly faster than traditional networks because it doesn’t have to be approved by a single authority.

## Blockchain in the Supply Chain

In the supply chain industry, blockchain can be used to create a fully integrated network that connects parties across an entire process. This can help to increase transparency from end to end, allowing all participants to see what’s happening with a shipment online. Blockchain can also help to reduce friction in the system by automating manual processes, like confirming shipment of goods. This can help to reduce costs by eliminating the need to hire extra employees to handle these tasks.

## Blockchain in the Software Development Lifecycle

In software development, blockchain can be implemented across different phases of the SDLC. First, it can be used to establish trust between different stakeholders, like customers, IT teams, and vendors. This can help to reduce the risk of disputes by providing a single source of information. Second, blockchain can be used to automate contract management by enabling parties to embed business rules into the network. For example, a rule may state that a customer can’t approve payment for a project until their review is complete. Third, blockchain can be used to review completed work. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud by enabling stakeholders to validate whether work is accurate and complete.

## Blockchain in the User Experience

Blockchain can be used to build trust with potential customers or users of your product or service. This can be achieved by providing them with transparent information about how your product works, what data is collected, and what happens to that data moving forward. This can help to prevent concerns about the security of data, privacy of the user, or the scalability of the platform.

## How to implement blockchain in your business or software

There are a few different ways to implement blockchain into your business or software. First, you can partner with a blockchain vendor that can help you to design an end-to-end network to solve specific business problems. Alternatively, you can partner with a consulting firm that can help you to design a blockchain use case that fits within your existing infrastructure. Finally, you can implement a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that enables you to build your own blockchain solution without needing to understand the technical details.

## Final Thoughts

Blockchain is a promising new technology that can help businesses and organizations to achieve greater efficiency, security, and trust. It promises to transform the way that we conduct transactions and conduct business online. In order to realize these benefits, businesses will need to fully embrace blockchain as a core part of their operations. This can mean taking a strategic approach to implementation, as well as forming partnerships with vendors and service providers that can help integrate blockchain throughout the entire organization.
