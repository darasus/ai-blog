intro: >-
  With the specter of mutually assured destruction looming over every
  global crisis and proxy conflict, the Cold War is perhaps one of the most
  fraught periods in history. There are no heroes in this period—just two
  paranoid superpowers scrambling to maintain the upper hand, irrespective of
  cost. The inherent darkness and moral ambiguity of that period makes for
  fantastic fodder for any storyteller looking to immerse their audience in a
  stark world where there are no easy answers.

  The 1980s was a peak moment in that tension—from Reagan’s “evil empire” speech and constant saber-rattling, to the U.S.-backed Contra War against Communist rebels in Nicaragua and an escalation of tensions between NATO and the USSR all around the globe. In brief: It was not a good time to be alive if you believed in world peace. Thankfully, Hollywood had spies as intrepid as Tom Hanks ready to leap into action against those dastardly Soviet Commies whenever they needed someone captured or rescued from behind enemy lines.

## “Bridge of Spies” is a beautiful and restrained spy thriller

James B. Donovan was an insurance lawyer who got caught up in some Cold War intrigue, but not in the way you’d expect. When the CIA wanted to drop Soviet spy Rudolf Abel off in the middle of New York City and make a quick getaway without attracting too much attention, Donovan was asked to represent the spy in court and keep him from being executed.
For a man who was not a trained spy or even someone in the government, this was quite a heap of responsibility to shoulder. But it’s also the kind of situation where a well-trained lawyer can really shine, so it’s fortunate that Donovan was up to the task.

## Marking Steven Spielberg’s return to Cold War storytelling

Spielberg has made a name for himself as a director of blockbuster action movies, but he started his career crafting thoughtful period dramas like “The Sugarland Express” and “1941”. Notoriously, a planned Cold War thriller called “1941“ turned into a raucous comedy when the director decided to improvise his scenes with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.
Yet “1941” also included a portrait of a real-life lawyer who defended several people accused of being Communist spies. That lawyer was also the man who helped negotiate the release of a U-2 pilot who was shot down and captured by the Soviets.
For Spielberg, this was his chance to get back to his roots and tell a story about the risks and moral ambiguities of Cold War espionage.

## Humanizing the villains

When it comes to Cold War spy stories, there’s no shortage of American heroes willing to risk their lives for the noble cause of freedom. Yet the most memorable Cold War stories look at how the Iron Curtain didn’t just insulate the Soviet Union from outside influence, but also prevented Soviet citizens from expressing themselves freely.
And “Bridge of Spies” is no exception—even the villainous KGB officer played by Alan Alda is fleshed out as a man who is just doing his job, albeit one that is morally repugnant.
When Alda’s character responds with “What is the point of all these questions?” to the FBI agent questioning him, it’s a moment that shatters the myth of the omnipotent Big Bad KGB officer who will crush the Free World if left unhindered. Instead, Alda’s character is a man who is just trying to get through his workday.

## The risks of hot-headed spy craft during the Cold War

When we think of espionage during the Cold War, many of us imagine Secret Agents dashing about the globe, defusing bombs and seducing women with the dulcet tones of Sean Connery’s Scottish accent. Yet for every daring escape and high-stakes infiltration of enemy territory, there’s also a lot of hours spent sitting in dingy, cramped rooms waiting for the other side to make a move.
While there are no easy solutions to the anxiety of waiting for something to happen, there’s one thing that all Cold War spymasters agree on: The less you let your own emotions cloud your judgment while you’re waiting, the better your odds are at success. And Spielberg’s film is a fantastic example of that kind of controlled spy craft.

## Conclusion

Spielberg’s “Bridge of Spies” may not have the thrills or high-flying adventure of his Indiana Jones adventures, but it is a masterful example of how to make a Cold War spy story that is as tense as it is interesting. Yet more importantly, it is also a great reminder of the dangers of letting our emotions get the best of us when it comes to making important decisions.

When we are so desperate for an easy win that we risk stepping on the rights of others, or when we are so angry that we fail to see the larger picture, we risk making the wrong choices that can have long-lasting and devastating consequences.
