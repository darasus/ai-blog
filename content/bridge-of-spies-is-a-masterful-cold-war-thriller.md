Bridge of Spies is a masterful Cold War thriller that tells the story of American lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a downed U.S. pilot (Austin Stowell) and to negotiate the release of a captured American spy (Amy Ryan).

Donovan is thrust into the middle of the Cold War when he is asked to negotiate the release of Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), a U.S. pilot who was shot down over the Soviet Union. Donovan must also deal with the capture of American spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is being held by the Soviets.

Donovan is able to negotiate the release of Powers and Abel, but he is also forced to deal with the ramifications of the Cold War. The film is a tense and thrilling look at the Cold War and the people who were caught in the middle of it.
