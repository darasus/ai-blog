Computer science programs generally provide an excellent foundation for those interested in pursuing software engineering as a specific career path, but these programs alone often aren\\u2019t enough.\nPrograms specifically tailored toward software engineering can help you gain the skills and training you need to succeed in this field.

For example, being able to define your own custom data types is something not many other general-purpose languages have. In addition, Go makes it easy to build packages of related functions and variables so they can be reused easily. The simplicity of the language makes it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers who don\\u2019t want to spend a lot of time learning new syntax and semantics.\nThis article covers some popular use cases for Go by exploring its usage in image processing projects like webcam streaming and photo manipulation libraries such as GoImager or the old standard image package inbuilt with every installation of Go which we will see later in this article.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
