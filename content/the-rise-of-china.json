The first civilization to emerge in East Asia, it soon became a vibrant and powerful civilization with an immense cultural influence.\nThe first time that China was recognized as a global superpower was during the Han Dynasty, which existed from 206 BC to 220 AD. It was during this time that the Silk Road was established and trade flourished between the East and West. The Roman Empire also imported large amounts of Chinese silk, whereas the Chinese imported glass, jewelry, wine, and spices from the Romans.\nDuring the Middle Ages, China was ruled by the Mongols, whose empire stretched from Central Asia to the Mediterranean Sea. After their rule ended, China was ruled by the Ming Dynasty. It was during this time that China became the most advanced civilization in the world, with trade routes and goods extending all across Asia.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Reasons for China's rise\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`China\\u2019s ascent to the top of the world has been gradual and extraordinarily steady. In the last 100 years, it has experienced two major wars, widespread economic transformation, political revolution, and massive population growth. During this time, other countries have seen their power ebb and flow in cycles of growth and decline. Unlike many other nations, China has seen a steady climb toward dominance.\nDuring the 20th century, China was the site of two brutal wars. The First Sino-Japanese War ended in 1895 with Japanese control of the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Chinese island of Hainan. The Second Sino-Japanese War, which began in 1937, lasted nearly 10 years, was fought on Chinese soil, and ended with Japan\\u2019s occupation of China.\nYet this sequence of violent conflicts ended in Chinese victory and Japan\\u2019s withdrawal from Chinese territory. China also emerged from the Second World War as one of the most populous countries in the world.\nIn the 1950s, China\\u2019s economy was rapidly transforming from a primarily agricultural state to an industrialized one. The breakneck pace of economic change led to the Great Chinese Famine, which began in 1959 and killed between 15 million and 45 million Chinese people.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Rapid Industrialization\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`It might seem counterintuitive that rapid industrialization would be one of the reasons for China\\u2019s ascent, but it is crucial to understanding the context of China\\u2019s economic rise.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, China\\u2019s economy was primarily agricultural and depended on the production of food. In order to break free from this model, the Chinese government implemented the Great Leap Forward, a campaign of economic development and rapid industrialization.\nIn the span of just a few years, China transformed from a largely agrarian economy to an industrialized one. To facilitate this change, the Chinese government required its people to produce steel for household utensils, instead of purchasing them from other countries.\nThis massive push for industrialization led to widespread famine, death from malnutrition, and even the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-1961. Nevertheless, it also resulted in China becoming an industrialized country.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Military strength\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`China\\u2019s military strength today is a major source of its strength as a whole. Its military is the second-largest in the world, after the U.S., and one of only a handful that can be confidently described as a superpower.\nThe People\\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is a massive force, with more than 2.3 million active personnel, and about 8.25 million in total. The Chinese military has seen extensive modernization in the past few decades and boasts a substantial amount of high-tech weaponry.\nThe Chinese military\\u2019s enormous size also gives it significant sway over international affairs.

This means that many of the world\\u2019s other major languages have borrowed heavily from Chinese.\nChinese culture permeates many other countries as well, with Chinese food being consumed around the world and Chinese martial arts being practiced in many places outside of China.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Conclusion\"),mdx(\"p\",null,`China\\u2019s influence is evident not only in raw economic statistics, but in its global impact as well.
