It was during this time that the Silk Road was established and trade flourished between the East and West. The Roman Empire also imported large amounts of Chinese silk, whereas the Chinese imported glass, jewelry, wine, and spices from the Romans.\nDuring the Middle Ages, China was ruled by the Mongols, whose empire stretched from Central Asia to the Mediterranean Sea.

During this time, other countries have seen their power ebb and flow in cycles of growth and decline. Unlike many other nations, China has seen a steady climb toward dominance.\nDuring the 20th century, China was the site of two brutal wars. The First Sino-Japanese War ended in 1895 with Japanese control of the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Chinese island of Hainan. The Second Sino-Japanese War, which began in 1937, lasted nearly 10 years, was fought on Chinese soil, and ended with Japan\\u2019s occupation of China.\nYet this sequence of violent conflicts ended in Chinese victory and Japan\\u2019s withdrawal from Chinese territory. China also emerged from the Second World War as one of the most populous countries in the world.\nIn the 1950s, China\\u2019s economy was rapidly transforming from a primarily agricultural state to an industrialized one.

In order to break free from this model, the Chinese government implemented the Great Leap Forward, a campaign of economic development and rapid industrialization.\nIn the span of just a few years, China transformed from a largely agrarian economy to an industrialized one. To facilitate this change, the Chinese government required its people to produce steel for household utensils, instead of purchasing them from other countries.\nThis massive push for industrialization led to widespread famine, death from malnutrition, and even the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-1961.

Today, there are only 104 women serving as U.S. representatives and senators, which amounts to 19 percent of all legislators in the Senate and House of Representatives combined. Women also account for just 24 percent of state legislators, 28 percent of city council members, and 15 percent of mayors.\nTo make matters more challenging, this imbalance is not only apparent but also more pronounced in the political sphere than in any other industry. In business management, for example, women hold almost half (44%) of executive roles . But in government? They account for less than one-fifth (19%) of state legislators, city council members, and mayors combined.\nAs a result, when it comes to women in politics we often see a lopsided list that skews toward white cisgender able-bodied wealthy educated privileged women who look very little like the rest of us. And while we\\u2019re happy to see these women rising up as leaders within government \\u2014 they are after all our representatives \\u2014 we can do better\\u2026and we must do better if we want our democracy back from the patriarchy that currently controls it so thoroughly.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
