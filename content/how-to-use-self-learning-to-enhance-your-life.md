## Why self-learning?

There are many reasons why you might want to start self-learning. Maybe you're starting a new job or business, or you're looking to change your career path. Perhaps you're trying to advance your career, or you're trying to gain new skills to help you be more competitive in the job market. Maybe you're trying to improve your health and fitness, or you're studying for an exam or certification. Whatever your reason for wanting to become a self-learner, self-learning can help you reach your goals faster and more effectively by increasing your knowledge, skills, and confidence.

Self-learning is an important skill to have in the modern workplace, where employers are increasingly expecting their employees to be self-directed learners. Rather than expecting a teacher or boss to give you the information you need, you'll need to seek out that information yourself.

## Be a lifelong learner

As you progress through life, you'll encounter new situations and challenges, and you'll have the opportunity to learn new skills and expand your knowledge. You'll also have a wide range of interests and passions that you can explore and expand on. Being a lifelong learner means that you actively pursue new knowledge and skills throughout your life.

Continuing to learn throughout your life can help you find meaning and purpose, discover new interests, and keep up with an ever-changing world by improving your skills and knowledge.

You may want to try reading books and articles, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, watching videos, taking online courses, joining a study group, or even doing experiments to test and apply your new skills. The key is to actively engage with the material so you understand and remember what you're learning. You can also consider working with a mentor to help you navigate your specific interests.

You can try self-learning by reading books and articles on your field, attending online courses, or taking classes from a university or online program.

Some companies allow employees to pursue side projects related to their work, which can help you gain new skills and advance your career.
