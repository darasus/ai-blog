  It was designed with the goal of making it easier to write software that takes
  advantage of parallel computing. Go is a high-level programming language that
  is designed to be easy to use. It’s simple and straightforward, but also has
  powerful features that make it suitable for large-scale applications. While
  the Go language does make sense for parallel computing, it does have a few
  limitations. It doesn’t have built-in features to make it easy to distribute
  data across multiple machines.
intro: If you’ve read up on the world of parallel computing, you’ll know that
  it’s a field that is growing rapidly in importance. Parallel computing refers
  to the simultaneous execution of computer programs or tasks so that they
  operate at the same time rather than sequentially. This ability to execute
  multiple processes simultaneously leads to faster and more efficient results.
  Applications like artificial intelligence, image recognition, and natural
  language processing are all fields that can benefit greatly from parallel
  computing techniques. Because of this demand for parallel computing
  techniques, there are many programming languages available specifically for
  this purpose. The Go language is one such example. In this article, we will
  explain what Go is and its benefits for parallel computing.

## What is Go?

The Go language is an open source programming language developed by Google. It was designed with the goal of making it easier to write software that takes advantage of parallel computing.
The Go programming language was created by engineers at Google in 2007. These engineers were building a large-scale distributed system at the time. They discovered that the languages they were using at the time didn’t have the features they needed to scale up their system. So they built a new language with the features they needed.
Go is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to use. It’s simple and straightforward, but also has powerful features that make it suitable for large-scale applications. It’s also designed to be fast and efficient, which is important for any language being used for parallel programming.

## Why parallelize?

Computer systems are comprised of many different components that work together to process data. You may have heard of terms like CPU, RAM, GPU, and hard drive. All these components play an important role in how quickly and efficiently your computer can handle tasks. Inside these components, there are thousands of tiny transistors that process data.
The amount of data that can be processed at any given time is known as the processing capacity of the computer system. A typical computer has a processing capacity of about one or two instructions per second.
Now imagine you have a large amount of data and need to process it. In this case, you’ll need to wait for the computer to finish processing the first piece of data before it can move onto the next one. This process is known as sequential processing. It’s what happens in the majority of computer systems.

## Go for Parallel Computing

In this section, we’ll examine why the Go language makes sense for parallel computing. Let’s first look at the basics of parallel computing.
In parallel computing, you split the processing of data into multiple pieces, each of which is then processed simultaneously. Parallel computing is different from serial processing because it doesn’t require the computer to finish one piece of data before moving onto the next.

This parallelizing of data processing can be done at different levels. One method is within a single program, where one or more instructions are executed at a time. Another method is to split the data into different programs that can be processed simultaneously by using multiple computers.

## Limitations of Go for Parallel Computing

Although the Go language does make sense for parallel computing, it does have a few limitations. One of the main issues for developers using Go for parallel computing is that it can be difficult to find enough computer systems to handle the load.
The language also doesn’t have built-in features to make it easy to distribute data across multiple machines.
For example, if you want to split a large dataset between two computers and then combine the results together again, you’ll have to write custom code to do this. This can make it challenging to work with large data sets in parallel.

## Key takeaway

The Go language is designed to make it easier to write software that takes advantage of parallel computing. Parallel computing refers to the simultaneous execution of computer programs or tasks so that they operate at the same time rather than sequentially.
Go is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to use. It’s simple and straightforward, but also has powerful features that make it suitable for large-scale applications.
