Mediation involves the participation of a neutral third party called a mediator.

A grievance may be pursued for different reasons, such as a desire for compensation or the wish for an apology. While mediation can sometimes resolve both of these types of disputes, the parties must agree on a common goal for the mediation process to be successful.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Mediation is best used when parties want to resolve their dispute as quickly and inexpensively as possible.

Most mediators have either legal or social work training, or both.
