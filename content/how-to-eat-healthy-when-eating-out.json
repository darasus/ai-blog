Super cool, right? Well, sort of. If you\\u2019re like most adults and teens, you probably don\\u2019t have time to pack your own lunch every day. Instead, many of us rely on fast food or convenience stores for our midday meal.

These days there are many drive-through restaurants that serve much healthier versions of the standard fast food menu items.
