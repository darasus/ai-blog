If you're wondering how to know if you're on the right track when it comes to finding a soulmate, here are four things to keep in mind.

1. There's a mutual feeling of respect and admiration.

When you're with your potential soulmate, you should feel a mutual sense of respect and admiration. You should also feel like your partner is truly interested in getting to know you on a deeper level.

2. You share similar values and goals.

One of the key components of a lasting relationship is having shared values and goals. If you can see yourself sharing a future with your partner, it's a good sign that you're on the right track.

3. You're comfortable being yourself around them.

When you're with your soulmate, you should feel comfortable being yourself. There's no need to put on a facade or pretend to be someone you're not.
