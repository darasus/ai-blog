## What is Go?

Go is a compiled programming language designed around simplicity, readability, and scalability. It has a strong focus on concurrent programming and is commonly used for backend server development, especially in areas where robustness and resilience are important.

Like most modern programming languages, Go’s syntax is mostly composed of keywords and symbols that resemble the functionality being performed. While this is helpful for new programmers, it can be a bit daunting for those who are new to coding.

There are many articles online that can help you get comfortable with the syntax. It’s worth mentioning that Go’s simplicity makes it easier to read and understand code. This can be incredibly helpful when you’re working with programming languages that are new to you.

## Concurrency support

Concurrent programming is a technique that enables applications to perform multiple tasks at the same time. This is useful when you are building applications that have to deal with heavy loads since they can do more with fewer resources.

Go’s standard library makes it easy to implement concurrency in your applications. In fact, this is the key reason why major companies like Google, Netflix, Dropbox, Uber, New York Times and Cisco are using Go for their backend services.

If you’re building a web application, chances are you’ll want to be prepared for a spike in traffic. Say that your application serves videos on a live streaming platform—it will have to handle an extremely high volume of concurrent requests.

The good news is that Go’s concurrency support makes it easy to handle these spikes. For example, if your application is getting 1,000 concurrent requests, it can still process them all even if your server is only set up to handle 400 requests.

## Go’s ability to handle big data sets

One of the biggest advantages of Go is the language’s ability to handle big data sets. When you have to work with large data sets, you will have to find ways to quickly process them.
One of the main reasons that Go is being adopted by most companies is its ability to process big data sets. Go has a number of features that make it easy to process big data sets. For example, the language’s map/reduce functionality lets you process large data sets using a parallel approach that divides the data into smaller chunks for processing.

Go’s garbage collector is another feature that makes it easy to handle big data sets. This feature automatically frees up memory when items are no longer in use. Since computers have limited memory, it’s important that your code clean up after itself.

Since Go’s garbage collector automatically cleans up memory that is no longer in use, it makes it easier to handle big data sets since memory won’t be used.

## Built-in testing tools

Building robust software is challenging since you have to account for a number of potential bugs that can affect your program’s output. It’s important to write tests to make sure that your code is functioning as it should be. It is a tedious task but it’s also very important.
You can make your life easier by using a programming language that makes it easy to create tests.
Go’s testing functionality is built into the language. When you create a new project, Go creates a file that creates a testing environment that is both simple to use and reliable.

The testing functionality within Go is powerful enough to allow you to create tests that simulate the way your application is going to work when deployed. You can use this feature to find issues such as the amount of time it takes to complete a given task or if an error can occur in a particular situation.

## Language stability

New programming languages often come with a lot of hype and promise. However, many of them don’t survive the test of time and eventually die out.
This doesn’t mean that Go will be around forever. But it does show that it is a mature language that has been around for a while and is not likely to go away anytime soon.
As a programmer, you don’t want to be constantly switching languages as a new one comes out every few months. You want to pick a language that is stable and will be around for a long time.

## Summary

Go is an open source programming language that makes it possible to build simple and reliable software faster. It has emerged as one of the most successful alternatives to legacy languages like C, C++, and Java in recent years. Top companies like Google, Dropbox, Netflix, Uber, and many others are adopting Go for their backend services—and not just because of its unusual mascot character. Go’s simplicity makes it easier to read and understand code. Its standard libraries mean programmers don’t need to create common functions from scratch every time they write a program. Its built-in concurrency enables fast performance for programs that make multiple simultaneous requests. And its support for interfaces means you can build flexible software without worrying about what kind of data your code expects. There is no denying that there are a lot of benefits from using Go for developing web applications . Here we will discuss why you should consider using this popular programming language for your web development projects.
