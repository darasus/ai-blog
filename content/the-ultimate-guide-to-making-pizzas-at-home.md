## What’s the secret to a great home-cooked pizza?

There are many secrets to cooking a great pizza at home, but the most important of all is getting the crust right. The best pizzas are made with a thin crust that’s chewy, crispy, and slightly oily on the outside, but soft and tender inside. A good pizza dough will also have just the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor of other ingredients. To make the perfect pizza dough, you’ll need to mix up a batch of bread or pizza dough. To get the best results, you’ll need to combine all the dry ingredients and then add in the wet ingredients. The most important thing you can do is knead the dough well. You should knead it until it’s soft and smooth, but not sticky. If you knead the dough long enough, it will go from a sticky, rough texture to a smooth, silky texture.

## Equipment you’ll need for the best home pizza making

If you’re serious about making great pizzas at home, you’ll need to invest in the right equipment. Besides the basics such as a chef’s knife and a cutting board, you’ll need a food processor and a stand mixer, plus a baking sheet, baking stone, pizza stone, rolling pin, and pizza cutter. A pizza peel is another handy piece of equipment to have, but it’s not essential.
