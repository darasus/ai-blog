summary: The best pizzas are made with a thin crust that’s chewy, crispy, and
  slightly oily on the outside, but soft and tender inside. A good pizza dough
  will also have just the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor of other
  ingredients. The most important thing you can do is knead the dough well, so
  knead it until it's soft and smooth, but not sticky. If you’re serious about
  making great pizzas at home, you'll need to invest in the right equipment.
intro: When it comes to eating out, the humble pizza remains one of the most
  popular meal choices. After all, who doesn’t like a hot, cheesy, gooey
  personal-sized pie? But with so many fast-food and casual chains offering
  their own versions of this classic dish, it can be hard to know where to find
  the best pizza when you want it. Luckily, thanks to rising demand for home
  delivery and takeout services as well as growing interest in gourmet cooking
  and home-delivery meal kit services such as Blue Apron, home-cooked pizzas are
  easier than ever to make at home. And whether you favor red sauce or white
  sauce; classic Italian toppings or something more exotic; traditional thin
  crust or super thick pan or even cauliflower crust – this guide will show you
  how.

## What’s the secret to a great home-cooked pizza?

There are many secrets to cooking a great pizza at home, but the most important of all is getting the crust right. The best pizzas are made with a thin crust that’s chewy, crispy, and slightly oily on the outside, but soft and tender inside. A good pizza dough will also have just the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor of other ingredients. To make the perfect pizza dough, you’ll need to mix up a batch of bread or pizza dough. To get the best results, you’ll need to combine all the dry ingredients and then add in the wet ingredients. The most important thing you can do is knead the dough well. You should knead it until it’s soft and smooth, but not sticky. If you knead the dough long enough, it will go from a sticky, rough texture to a smooth, silky texture.

## Equipment you’ll need for the best home pizza making

If you’re serious about making great pizzas at home, you’ll need to invest in the right equipment. Besides the basics such as a chef’s knife and a cutting board, you’ll need a food processor and a stand mixer, plus a baking sheet, baking stone, pizza stone, rolling pin, and pizza cutter. A pizza peel is another handy piece of equipment to have, but it’s not essential.
