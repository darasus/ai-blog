## What you’ll need to make a pizza at home

The first thing you will need to make a pizza at home is a pizza baking tray or stone. A baking tray will be sufficient to make thin and pan pizzas, but if you want to make stuffed or deep dish pizzas, you will need a pizza stone.
A pizza peel can be used to place the pizza on the baking tray/stone, but it isn’t essential.
Next, you’ll need to pick the dough for your pizzas. You can make the dough from scratch, or buy a ready-made pizza dough from your local shop. If you choose to make your own pizza dough, the easiest way to do it is by using a bread maker.
You’ll also need a rolling pin to make the pizza dough as thin as possible. As a finishing touch to your pizzas, you may want to also buy some pizza cutters.
A pizza cutter makes it much easier to cut the pizzas, and since pizza is such a messy food, it’s a good idea to have some paper towels on hand as well.
