## What is JavaFX?

JavaFX is a technology for creating rich client applications on different platforms, such as mobile devices and desktop computers. It is a scene-based, declarative programming language that is designed for composability, extensibility, and high performance.
JavaFX can also be used to create applications for embedded systems, such as media players, digital signal processors, and medical instruments.

As mentioned above, JavaFX is a technology for creating applications and user interfaces. It allows you to create GUIs and applications using a combination of visual tools and code. In other words, you can use a combination of code and visual tools to create GUIs and applications.
Although the official term for this concept is a “visual GUI builder,” it has been widely criticized for being misleading. The idea behind visual GUI builders is to allow you to create the GUI for your application using a visual interface, rather than writing code.

## Why use JavaFX?

JavaFX is a modern and standardized UI framework, which empowers you to create simple and complex applications. JavaFX is a platform that allows you to create and deploy high-performance apps that run on different platforms, including desktop computers, mobile devices, and embedded systems.
Since JavaFX is a standard Java technology, it enables portability and interoperability across various platforms, including iOS and Android. It is also compatible with other Java-based technologies, such as Java SE and Java ME.
Moreover, JavaFX is built on the latest version of the Java platform, and it is completely open source. So, it is highly extensible and has a large ecosystem of tools and libraries that support it.

## Benefits of using JavaFX

Greater control over the UI - You have full control over the UI components, and you can customize them as per your requirements. This is because JavaFX is a scene-based and declarative programming language.

Consistent cross-platform experience - Users expect a consistent experience across platforms. JavaFX allows you to create a single application that provides the same experience across different platforms.

Improved performance on mobile - JavaFX can help you improve the performance of your app on mobile devices by enabling you to offload complex operations to remote servers.

Ease of deployment - Developers often face challenges while deploying apps across different devices. JavaFX simplifies the process of deploying apps and allows you to create mobile apps using standard Java APIs.

## Limitations of JavaFX

JavaFX is a mature technology that is well accepted in the developer community. However, it’s important to note that it has certain limitations, which are as follows

Limited support - The latest version of the JavaFX framework is version 2, which was released in 2014. There is no information available about the next version of JavaFX.
JavaFX is compatible with the Java platform and runs on any platform where the Java platform is supported. However, it will be a challenge for the Java community to keep up with the latest UI trends and technologies.
JavaFX is a declarative language, and as such, it is not a full-stack framework.

## Key takeaways

JavaFX is a technology for creating rich client applications on different platforms. It is a scene-based, declarative programming language that is designed for composability, extensibility, and high performance.

JavaFX allows you to create a single application that provides the same experience across different platforms. JavaFX is a mature technology that is well accepted in the developer community. It has certain limitations, however.

Despite these limitations, JavaFX is a great option for developing cross-platform, modern applications. If you are looking for solutions to ease the UI development process and create consistent cross-platform apps, JavaFX can be a great option.

Now that you know what JavaFX is and what it brings to the table, it’s time to explore where it’s being used. Stay tuned!
