summary: GraphQL is a data querying language that lets you access data from a
  server. It’s been around for a while, growing in popularity every year since
  its introduction in 2015. GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs
  and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems.
  Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier
  to find exactly what you’re looking for and allow the front end to specify the
  exact data it needs.
intro: >-
  What if your data didn’t have walls? What if it could respond to exactly
  what you need and nothing more? What if it could directly give you what you
  wanted instead of forcing you to ask for it in complicated, roundabout ways?
  Most importantly, what if your users could see everything about your site at
  once – and find what they need easily? 

  This is the promise of GraphQL. It’s an alternative to REST APIs that opens up entire datasets instead of just individual endpoints. That means that instead of asking for data about users, their profile, or their account separately — as though each piece was in its own locked room — you can ask for Users> and get back every user on the site at once with no additional steps or roadblocks. Users> . . . and Profile> . . . and Account> – all unlocked at once. And while that sounds like a lot more work, it actually means less work overall because the dataset is so much smaller and simpler than with traditional APIs.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a data querying language. It’s a way to request information from a server, usually in the form of a JSON payload. It’s been around for a while, growing in popularity every year since its introduction in 2015. It’s been used for everything from apps to websites, and is quickly becoming a standard for API development.

All of that sounds pretty simple, but like any technology, it’s more complicated than it appears at first glance. So, let’s break it down. GraphQL is a data querying language. That means that you use this language to access data from a server. That data is stored in a database, and that database can be anywhere: a server on your company’s network, a cloud service like Amazon Web Services, or a third-party API.

## Why Use GraphQL?

GraphQL was created as an improvement over REST APIs and other tools used to communicate between front-end and back-end systems. Its aim is to simplify how data is requested and retrieved, making it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for and allowing the front-end to specify the exact data it needs. The front-end is usually the user’s browser, but it could be any app accessing data. If a company’s marketing team wants to see a list of current customers or current campaigns, they could use GraphQL to request that data with one call instead of logging into several different systems, each with its own interface and its own set of instructions for getting that data.

## Why is GraphQL so great?

One reason is that GraphQL minimizes the server calls needed for a given operation. If you access data using REST, you have to make one call for each thing you want. If you access that data using GraphQL, you only have to make one call for everything. On the surface, that doesn’t seem like a big difference – but it changes everything behind the scenes. Imagine you have a website where the homepage has 10 different widgets: widgets that display data, widgets that let your visitors sign in, widgets that let them log out. With a REST API, your website has to go through 10 different endpoints to get all of those widgets. With GraphQL, it goes through one.

## How to Learn More About GraphQL?

The best way to get started with GraphQL is to use it. If you’re building a new site, try implementing GraphQL, or if you’re working with an existing project, try to see if you can integrate it. You can also check out GraphQL’s documentation, which is extensive and easy to navigate.

You can also check out blog posts and videos from other developers who have learned about GraphQL, as well as podcasts and newsletters. You can also reach out to developer communities like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow for help.

## Wrapping up

GraphQL has been growing in popularity for years. It’s easy to understand, easy to use, and promises to remove many of the headaches inherent in working with data. This is a great time to start learning about GraphQL, whether you’re a developer or a product manager. It’s a tool that can make your job easier, and it’s an important part of the future of data management and retrieval.
