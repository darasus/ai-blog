That doesn\\u2019t mean the product isn\\u2019t organic, but it\\u2019s worth researching the brand to find out for sure.

In a word, yes. But let\\u2019s break down why that is. Organic vs. conventional farming - Conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, including chemical sprays that can be harmful to humans. While some of these pesticides can be helpful in small doses, many can be dangerous. Organic farming, on the other hand, uses natural fertilizers and promotes biodiversity to fight pests naturally. This means that organic crops are less likely to be tainted with harmful chemicals.\nConventional produce - Many conventional fruits and vegetables are grown in highly fluorescent lights, which can be very harmful to the environment. Because of this, they aren\\u2019t as nutritious as they could be. Additionally, they may be sprayed with pesticides that can be harmful to you and your family. Organic produce - Organic produce is grown with fewer pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and to you and your family. And because it\\u2019s grown in more natural conditions, it\\u2019s more nutritious.\nConventional dairy - Most conventional dairy cows are raised on factory farms where they\\u2019re fed grain instead of grass. When cows aren\\u2019t let out in pastures to graze and forage for their food, their diet can be imbalanced. This means that the cows aren\\u2019t as healthy as they could be and the dairy they produce might not be as nutritious. Organic dairy - Organic dairy cows are raised on smaller farms that allow them to graze on pastures. Because of this, their diet is more balanced and their dairy is more nutritious.\nConventional meat - Conventional meat is often raised on large factory farms that use antibiotics and hormones to speed up the process. These meats are often tainted with these chemicals, and are less safe to eat. Organic meat - Organic meats are often raised on smaller farms that don\\u2019t use antibiotics or hormones to speed up the process.\nConventional coffee - Conventional coffee beans are often sprayed with harmful pesticides that can be very harmful to you when you drink them. Organic coffee - Organic coffee beans are grown without pesticides.\nConventional wheat - The wheat that conventional farmers grow is often genetically modified (GM) to be resistant to pests and diseases. Organic wheat - Organic wheat is not genetically modified (GM).\nConventional rice - Conventional rice often is grown with pesticides that can be harmful to you when you eat it. Organic rice - Organic rice is not grown with pesticides.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Are organic foods more nutritious?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This one is a tricky question.

If you\\u2019re thinking about starting a juicing regimen but aren\\u2019t quite sure where to start, we have just the thing for you.\nWe love juicing because it gives us an easy way to get lots of vitamins and minerals that we might not be getting from our other meals. The best part? Juicing is cheap (or free if you grow your own produce), easy and fast. You can make a glass of juice in less than 5 minutes without much prep work involved.\nJuicing also means that you\\u2019ll probably consume more fruits and vegetables than you would in any other form. This article covers everything you need to know about juicing including why it\\u2019s good for you, the different kinds of juicers available on the market today, how many calories are in different types of juices, and some awesome recipes to get you started!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

After all, who doesn\\u2019t like a hot, cheesy, gooey personal-sized pie? But with so many fast-food and casual chains offering their own versions of this classic dish, it can be hard to know where to find the best pizza when you want it. Luckily, thanks to rising demand for home delivery and takeout services as well as growing interest in gourmet cooking and home-delivery meal kit services such as Blue Apron, home-cooked pizzas are easier than ever to make at home. And whether you favor red sauce or white sauce; classic Italian toppings or something more exotic; traditional thin crust or super thick pan or even cauliflower crust \\u2013 this guide will show you how.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

However, the word \\u2018processed\\u2019 can be misleading.\nProcessed foods almost always have a shorter shelf life than their unprocessed counterparts.

Processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy and unprocessed foods aren\\u2019t always healthy.\nProcessing can take many forms. Some examples of processed foods include canned goods, frozen meals, packaged snacks, oils that have been refined or hydrogenated (as in Crisco), salt, sugar and starch that has been extracted from its original source (as in corn syrup or white sugar), spices that have been ground up, protein that has had artificial flavors or preservatives added to it (as in MSG), or food that has had artificial colors added to it (such as Red 40).`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
