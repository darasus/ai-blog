That doesn\\u2019t mean the product isn\\u2019t organic, but it\\u2019s worth researching the brand to find out for sure.

In a word, yes. But let\\u2019s break down why that is. Organic vs. conventional farming - Conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, including chemical sprays that can be harmful to humans. While some of these pesticides can be helpful in small doses, many can be dangerous. Organic farming, on the other hand, uses natural fertilizers and promotes biodiversity to fight pests naturally. This means that organic crops are less likely to be tainted with harmful chemicals.\nConventional produce - Many conventional fruits and vegetables are grown in highly fluorescent lights, which can be very harmful to the environment. Because of this, they aren\\u2019t as nutritious as they could be. Additionally, they may be sprayed with pesticides that can be harmful to you and your family. Organic produce - Organic produce is grown with fewer pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and to you and your family. And because it\\u2019s grown in more natural conditions, it\\u2019s more nutritious.\nConventional dairy - Most conventional dairy cows are raised on factory farms where they\\u2019re fed grain instead of grass. When cows aren\\u2019t let out in pastures to graze and forage for their food, their diet can be imbalanced. This means that the cows aren\\u2019t as healthy as they could be and the dairy they produce might not be as nutritious. Organic dairy - Organic dairy cows are raised on smaller farms that allow them to graze on pastures. Because of this, their diet is more balanced and their dairy is more nutritious.\nConventional meat - Conventional meat is often raised on large factory farms that use antibiotics and hormones to speed up the process. These meats are often tainted with these chemicals, and are less safe to eat. Organic meat - Organic meats are often raised on smaller farms that don\\u2019t use antibiotics or hormones to speed up the process.\nConventional coffee - Conventional coffee beans are often sprayed with harmful pesticides that can be very harmful to you when you drink them. Organic coffee - Organic coffee beans are grown without pesticides.\nConventional wheat - The wheat that conventional farmers grow is often genetically modified (GM) to be resistant to pests and diseases. Organic wheat - Organic wheat is not genetically modified (GM).\nConventional rice - Conventional rice often is grown with pesticides that can be harmful to you when you eat it. Organic rice - Organic rice is not grown with pesticides.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Are organic foods more nutritious?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This one is a tricky question.

These fats have been shown to reduce your risk of heart disease and may even help decrease inflammation and improve joint pain in people who suffer from arthritis.
