summary: There are some subtle differences in the types of exercise, and which
  is best for you will depend on your individual circumstances. Strengthening
  your muscles by lifting weights, performing resistance exercises, or using
  body weight exercises to build muscle, is important for everyone.
  Cardiovascular exercise – This is any exercise that raises your heart rate and
  makes you breathe harder, such as brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming,
  or dancing. Strength training increases the amount of calories you burn, and
  it makes your muscles bigger and more metabolically active, which makes them
  burn even more calories.
intro: >-
  You don’t have to be an athlete, or even remotely active, to see benefits
  from exercising. Regular exercise not only makes you feel good, it can also
  help you live a longer, healthier life.

  We all know that regular physical activity helps reduce the risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and other conditions related to sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits. These benefits can be seen almost immediately and continue over time with consistent exercise.

  The many benefits of exercise include: reducing stress, improving your mood and confidence; lowering your risk of heart disease and stroke; strengthening your bones and muscles; improving your balance and coordination; raising your metabolism so you burn more calories at rest; lowering your blood pressure; relieving depression; increasing oxygen to your brain so you think more clearly; increasing endorphins which makes you happier; giving you a healthy glow by improving skin tone and complexion, reducing acne and pimples.

## What Kind of Exercise Is Best?

As this article has shown, many different types of exercise can benefit your health. However, there are some subtle differences in the types of exercise, and which is best for you will depend on your individual circumstances.

Strength training – Strengthening your muscles by lifting weights, performing resistance exercises, or using body weight exercises to build muscle, is important for everyone. It is especially important for women since muscle burns more calories than fat. For example, a person who gains one pound of muscle will burn about five more calories per day than a person who gains one pound of fat.

Cardiovascular exercise – This is any exercise that raises your heart rate and makes you breathe harder, such as brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, or dancing. This type of exercise is great for your heart and lungs. It also helps to keep your body (and particularly your waist) slim. If you’re new to these activities, you should start with low-impact exercises like walking.

Exercise that combines strength training and cardiovascular exercise is even better, since it has the added benefit of burning more calories. Exercises such as jogging or swimming that use large muscle groups, combined with exercises that use smaller muscles such as weight lifting, can give you the best of both worlds.

## How much exercise do you need?

While there are some general guidelines for how much exercise you should do, these will vary from person to person. Some people may be able to get all the health benefits of exercise with just a bit of daily activity, while others may need to be more dedicated in order to reap the rewards of regular exercise.

For most people, 30 minutes of moderate exercise at least five days a week is thought to be the minimum amount needed to improve your health. If you’re just starting to increase your physical activity, you may find that you can gradually increase your exercise time to 30 minutes per day. However, if you haven’t exercised in a while, it would be a good idea to ease into it and start with just 10 minutes per day, gradually increasing your time as your body gets used to being more active.

## Why is exercise so important?

Besides the obvious fact that exercise makes you feel good, it can actually help prevent a range of health issues that are usually associated with getting older.

Exercise helps reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, reducing your cholesterol level, and improving your blood sugar metabolism. Exercise can also help reduce the risk of stroke by up to two-thirds.

Exercise can also help prevent or control diabetes by improving your glucose metabolism, reducing your risk of weight gain, and increasing insulin sensitivity. If you already have diabetes, exercise can help you control your blood sugar better and can reduce the amount of medication you need to take.

Exercise can help prevent osteoporosis by increasing your bone density. This can be particularly important for women after menopause, when they are at higher risk of osteoporosis.

Exercise can also reduce your risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and endometrial cancer. This is thought to be due to the fact that exercise can reduce your body weight and body fat.

## The benefits of strength training

Regularly lifting weights, or doing some other kind of resistance training, such as using resistance bands, can add years to your life and life to your years. Studies show that your risk of death from all causes is reduced when you regularly engage in strength training.

One of the most important benefits of strength training is that it helps you lose weight and keep it off. Strength training increases the amount of calories you burn, and it makes your muscles bigger and more metabolically active, which makes them burn even more calories.

Strength training can also help prevent osteoporosis and other bone diseases, reduce your risk of diabetes, improve your balance and coordination, improve your mood, and even increase your lifespan!

## The benefits of cardio exercise

As we’ve discussed above, strength training is great for building up your muscles and metabolic rate, while also helping you lose weight. However, cardio exercises such as running or swimming help to keep your heart healthy and strong. Moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.

Cardiovascular exercises are also great for reducing stress. They can help to lower your cortisol levels, which means you have less stress in your system. Regularly doing cardio exercise can help you to deal with life’s challenges and to get a good night’s sleep.

Regularly doing cardio exercise can help you to improve your mental health. It can help to combat anxiety and depression, and it can help you to feel more optimistic about the world. Regularly doing cardio exercises can be a great way to keep your mental health strong.

## How to get started with exercise

If you haven’t exercised for a while, then you might be feeling a little bit nervous about starting. Don’t worry! Physical activities that get your heart rate up, such as jogging or swimming, are best done with a fitness trainer or coach at first, but there are many other types of exercise you can do on your own.

Exercising with a friend or family member can help you stay motivated and make the time go faster. You can choose an activity that fits your interests and schedule, such as gardening, cycling, walking or swimming, or you can join a recreational sports league or fitness class.

The important thing is that you find an activity that you enjoy and that fits your lifestyle. Remember, once you get over the initial start-up awkwardness, you’ll be surprised at how good you’ll feel doing regular exercise.
