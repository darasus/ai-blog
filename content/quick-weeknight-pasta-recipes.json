More consumers today are adopting a lifestyle that focuses on balanced and healthy diets instead of restrictive fad diets.\nIn response to these changing preferences, businesses everywhere have started offering more vegetarian options. In fact, even fast food chains like McDonald\\u2019s and Burger King have started adding meatless items to their menus in an effort to cater to this growing market segment. And with good reason. Millennials alone account for nearly one-third of the workforce \\u2014 a massive presence that will only continue to grow in coming years.\nThis rise in popularity of meatless Mondays is not surprising given how many people now choose to eat less meat, fish, or any animal products on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays.\nIf you\\u2019re looking for ways to reduce your red meat intake without sacrificing taste or variety in your diet, consider instituting Meatless Mondays at your place of business as well as at home.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

We drank glass after glass of orange juice, ate a piece of toast with peanut butter and maybe even gulped down a bowl of cereal or a few crackers with cheese. But once we hit high school, things started to get a little more complicated.\nThat\\u2019s because by the time most people reach their late teens, their bodies have developed an increasing need for more complex nutrients to fuel our minds and bodies throughout the day. Instead of drinking glasses of juice and eating crackers with cheese in the morning, most adults need to eat something that is substantial enough to keep them going until lunchtime. Thankfully, there are plenty of easy ways to accomplish this feat while also saving time and money at the same time! Here are 50 ideas that will make mornings infinitely better\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

The phenomenon of social consciousness is becoming more apparent and accessible to everyone, and it\\u2019s now easier than ever to understand the ethical and environmental implications of our actions.\nEven though most people are now aware of the role that climate change plays in destroying the planet and reducing its biodiversity, very few are taking actionable steps to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing waste and using cleaner energy. In addition to this, there is no singular answer or solution to reversing the effects of pollution on our home planet; rather, it will require an amalgamation of many different initiatives working together simultaneously.\nOne such initiative is veganism. A plant-based diet has a number of positive benefits on the environment \\u2014 mainly because raising livestock produces a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. If we all stopped eating meat it would have a huge effect on carbon dioxide levels, deforestation rates, and natural water courses.\nAs you\\u2019ll discover from reading this article, veganism could be the answer to climate change; however, there are also some drawbacks.
