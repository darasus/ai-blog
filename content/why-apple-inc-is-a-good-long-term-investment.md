## iOS Continues to Dominate the Worldwide Market

Over the last several years, Android has become a serious competitor to iOS. At one point, the growth of Android seemed unstoppable. Now, the rate of growth has slowed significantly.
Perhaps the biggest reason for the slowdown in Android’s growth is that there is a clear winner in the worldwide smartphone market.
Android has a much wider variety of manufacturers, with many different operating systems that run on those devices. Apple’s iOS has only one operating system that runs on one type of device — the iPhone.
As long as Apple continues to produce high-quality products, it will be able to retain its market dominance and should see steadily increasing sales as the iPhone user base grows.
The iPhone has become the flagship Apple product. As long as Apple keeps iPhone customers happy with regular software updates, they will continue to buy new iPhones as they become available each year.

## Apple Watch Shows Promise for the Future

Apple first introduced the Apple Watch in September of 2015. Although the device did not set the sales charts on fire in its initial year, the watch has shown steady improvement in each subsequent quarter.
Apple is likely to release a new version of the Apple Watch in the near future. As developers improve their software for the Apple Watch, the device will become more useful for more people.
As with the iPhone, Apple has a clear advantage in the wearable market. The company has a large customer base that is familiar with the Apple Watch. It also remains the only company that can create smartwatches with the full iOS operating system.
In time, the Apple Watch will grow into a significant source of revenue for the company. As more developers create apps for the device, it will become more useful to a growing number of people. Apple will delight these customers with regular software updates.

## Services Offer a Bright Path Forward

Apple has long been a hardware company. Its main source of revenue has come primarily from selling iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other electronic products.
Now that the company’s sales of iPhones have started to decline, many investors have questioned whether Apple will be able to remain a successful company.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeated his promise that the company will once again see significant growth in its sales. Cook believes that Apple will be able to grow its revenue by focusing on growth in its services.
These services include Apple Pay, iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and other services that people use on a regular basis.
Through Apple Pay, the App Store, and other services, Apple has a clear path to continued growth. As more people use these services, Apple will be able to significantly increase its revenue from services.

## Diversification Through Acquisitions

Some investors believe that Apple should find a way to diversify its business through large acquisitions. Apple has a massive cash pile that currently exceeds $250 billion.
The company has used some of this cash to buy back shares, thereby increasing the value of stock held by current shareholders. Apple has also used its cash to pay a large dividend to shareholders.
However, some investors believe that Apple should use a sizeable portion of its cash to acquire another company.

There are many potential acquisition targets that would fit nicely with Apple’s business. Some of these targets include Netflix, Disney, CBS, Tesla, and General Motors.
Each of these companies would bring something new to Apple’s business. Acquisitions would help Apple diversify its revenue sources, creating a more stable business.

## Conclusion

Investors who were worried about Apple’s future after the stock price fell so much during the last few years should take a look at the company again. The stock is still very cheap relative to its intrinsic value.
Apple has several bright spots that suggest the company will continue to be a successful business. The company’s iOS operating system continues to dominate the worldwide market for smartphones. People around the world continue to spend money on iTunes, the App Store, and other Apple services.

Apple also has a clear path forward with services, especially through the company’s growing subscription business. Acquisitions make good strategic sense for Apple, too.

If you believe in Apple’s long-term future, now is the time to buy more shares. With the company’s stock having fallen so much, it’s a great time to add to your position in Apple Inc.
