This is going to be your strategy for success and the roadmap for your company. If you want to be successful, you need a business plan. No matter what business you want to start, you need a business plan. The business plan helps you answer key questions. How much money do you need to start your business? Where will the money come from? How long before you break even? How long before you can quit your day job?

Yes, it\\u2019s important to have a physical presence, but it doesn\\u2019t have to come with a physical address.
