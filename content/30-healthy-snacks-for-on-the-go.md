summary: Greek yogurt with berries and granola is one of the healthiest and
  tastiest ways to start your day. Rice cakes with hummus paired with rice cakes
  are a fantastic alternative to crackers, chips, and other carb-heavy snacks.
  Whole grain crackers with cheese crackers are a great choice for when you have
  the time to sit down and eat. Japanese people are sometimes seen as having a
  healthy diet, but that's not the entire story. The Japanese diet has
  traditionally included a high consumption of fish and a wide range of
  vegetables.
intro: "You’ve probably heard it before: When you’re busy, you need healthy
  snacks to keep you going. The problem is that it’s not always easy to find
  healthy snacks that are also fast and convenient. In our hectic, on-the-go
  world, most of us don’t have time to sit down for a healthy meal three times a
  day. Instead, we’re often forced to make snap decisions about what we can eat
  quickly and conveniently. Unfortunately, those decisions too often lead to
  less than healthy snack options like potato chips or sweets. However, there
  are plenty of great ways to get your recommended daily intake of fruits and
  veggies even when you’re on the go. These 30 healthy snacks for on-the-go are
  perfect for keeping in your purse, desk drawer, locker, or anywhere else you
  might find yourself hungry and without access to a full meal."

## Greek yogurt with berries and granola

This is one of the healthiest and tastiest ways to start your day. It’s loaded with protein to keep you feeling full longer and it’s packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. By buying the plain, non-fat Greek yogurt, you can save calories and fat compared with the flavored varieties. Plus, you can add fresh berries, granola for crunch, and a drizzle of honey for sweetness. The Greek yogurt will also help to keep the granola from getting soggy, as it doesn’t require any milk or yogurt.

This is also a good make-ahead option. Prepare the yogurt, granola, and berries in separate containers and then just combine them right before eating. You can even put everything into a plastic bag to make it easy to transport.

## Rice cakes with hummus

Rice cakes are a fantastic alternative to crackers, chips, and other carb-heavy snacks. They’re light and crispy and they taste great with any number of topping options. You can also find them in a number of different flavors and even in savory varieties, which are especially good with hummus. Hummus makes for a great healthy snack on its own, but it’s even better paired with rice cakes.

You can buy rice cakes in bulk and keep a supply on hand for whenever you’re hungry. They’re also a great option for kids’ lunch boxes because they don’t get soggy or crumbly like crackers do.

## Veggie sticks and hummus

Hummus is a great choice for veggie sticks because it’s rich in protein and other nutrients while being low in calories—plus it tastes great on veggies. You can buy hummus in a variety of flavors, including garlic, roasted red pepper, and lemon. Use veggie sticks with the skin on to get more fiber and vitamins.

If you’re buying ready-made veggie sticks, make sure to read the label to make sure they’re not heavily salted or otherwise processed. It’s better to buy fresh vegetables and cut them up yourself. You can use a vegetable peeler to make the process quick and easy.

## Fruit and yogurt parfait

A classic parfait made from yogurt, granola, and fresh fruit is a great way to start the day or to kill the afternoon hunger pangs. You can buy granola in bulk and make sure it has no added sugar or other unnecessary ingredients. You can also make your own granola at home.

When buying yogurt, make sure to choose a brand that has no added sugar and uses whole milk, as opposed to low-fat or non-fat milk. You’ll get more nutrients that way. Plus, yogurt is a great source of probiotics, which can help improve digestion.

## Whole grain crackers with cheese

A healthy snack doesn’t have to be all about quick and easy. Sometimes, you just have to take the time to sit down at a table to eat. Cheese crackers are a great choice for when you have the time to sit down and eat. These are light and easy to transport, so you can easily bring them to work, school, or anywhere else where you’re in a snack-friendly environment.

Try to find crackers that have low sodium, low fat, and no preservatives. You can also make your own cheese crackers at home by topping cracker squares with a mixture of cheese and spices. This is also a great way to use up extra cheese that’s past its best-by date.

## Kashi Golean

Golbal and regional diets are always being studied, questioned and adjusted and this is particularly true of the Japanese diet. In the West, Japanese people are sometimes seen as having a healthy diet, but that's not the entire story. In fact, the Japanese diet has traditionally included a high consumption of fish and a wide range of vegetables.

A lesser known but fascinating aspect of the Japanese diet is that it often includes seaweed. While this might sound strange to many people outside Japan, seaweed is actually an important part of the traditional diet there. In fact, it accounts for around 20% of the calories in the diet.

## Frozen fruit smoothie maker

Frozen fruit smoothies are a fantastic choice for when you need a quick snack. They’re easy to make at home but they’re also available to purchase premade in many stores. They’re great because they’re refreshing and they’re also packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.

These smoothies are usually made with yogurt as a base, so they’re a good source of protein and calcium. They’re also usually sweetened with either sugar or artificial sweeteners. If you want to make them healthier, try adding fresh or frozen fruit and water instead. You can also add protein powder if you want a more substantial snack.

## Individual serving oatmeal packets

Oatmeal is one of the healthiest and most filling breakfast options. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the messiest. Squeezing it into a bowl and trying to eat it from there is messy, difficult, and can be less than satisfying. Instead of making a mess, get individual packets of oatmeal. They’re easy to make and you can quickly and easily pour them into a bowl or cup to eat.

Make sure to check the ingredients on the oatmeal packet to make sure that there are no preservatives or other unnecessary additives. You can also sweeten the oatmeal with honey or other natural sweeteners.

## Cheese stick and string bean combo

These two healthy snacks are great together. Cheese is a wonderful snack because it’s full of protein and calcium. You can also choose between different types of cheese and mix up your selections, so they don’t get boring. String beans are a great vegetable because they’re very low in calories, but they’re also high in fiber.

This combination is simple because you can eat the string beans and cheese as is. You can also dip the cheese in the beans, or you can wrap the string beans around the cheese and eat them together.

## Conclusion

These 30 healthy snacks for on-the-go will help you stay healthy and satisfied. They’re all easy to prepare or purchase premade and they’re all packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Whether you’re trying to lose weight or just eating healthy, these snacks are a great way to stay satisfied while also getting the nutrients you need.
