This may sound silly since the code is only visible to you, but you\\u2019ll be surprised at how much easier it will be to understand your code when you use descriptive variable names. For example, say you want to track the number of times a user clicks a button. You could name that variable something like \\u201CbClicks\\u201D, but that doesn\\u2019t really convey what the variable is used for. Instead, you could name that variable \\u201Cclicks\\u201D and write a sentence about what the variable is being used for. You might say \\u201Ctracks the number of times a user clicks a button\\u201D. That way, when you go back to your code months later, you\\u2019ll be able to understand what\\u2019s going on more easily.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Comment your code\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Comments are lines of code that won\\u2019t be executed but are intended to provide more information about what\\u2019s happening in your code. Comments are one of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code. Every time you write code you should include a comment that describes what that code is doing. You\\u2019ll find that as you work through more advanced coding projects, you\\u2019ll be able to look back at your code and understand what\\u2019s happening more easily if you\\u2019ve used comments to explain everything.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Only use English in your code\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Coding isn\\u2019t just about writing syntax or using loops and loops. It\\u2019s also about writing logic that computers can understand. When you write code, you\\u2019re writing a set of instructions that a computer can execute. For example, if you want to enable a feature, you can write code that says \\u201Cif a user has a certain payment method, then enable that payment method.\\u201D These instructions are meant to be read and understood by a human, but they\\u2019re also meant to be read and understood by a computer. At the same time, there are certain things that are specific to the computer \\u2013 things like the names of variables, loops, and functions. For example, the computer needs to know what \\u201Cclicks\\u201D means, so you have to write that in code. But when you\\u2019re writing the code, you don\\u2019t want to use words that are specific to a human. You want to use words that are specific to the computer. When you write code, you can only use words that the computer understands. You can\\u2019t use any words that are specific to humans. That\\u2019s why when you write code, you have to only use English. You can\\u2019t use any other languages like Spanish, French, or Chinese.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Always use const unless you have a good reason not to\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Constants are values that you don\\u2019t want to change, so you declare them as a constant.

You\\u2019ll use them for things like the number of days in a month, the number of hours in a day, or any other value that you know won\\u2019t change. When you\\u2019re first learning how to code, it\\u2019s important to always use const unless you have a good reason not to. The only time you would not use const is if you wanted a value to change over time. For example, if a button needs to change colour over time, you wouldn\\u2019t use a constant. If a number needs to change depending on what someone inputs, you wouldn\\u2019t use a constant.

One such framework is Spring, which is currently one of the most widely used lightweight enterprise solution platforms available today.

We will cover the fundamentals of setting up a project, creating tables and handling user logins.\nWe have all probably heard of SQL databases before. They are used to store data in tables so that you can query the data efficiently. Each table has columns with the properties of that entity stored as values in those columns.\nHowever, building an entire database from scratch is not something that most developers would want to do on a daily basis. This is where Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries come in useful. Instead of dealing directly with SQL tables and their contents, you can use these libraries to represent your domain objects as entities in their own right. Once you\\u2019ve done that, it becomes much easier to persist them into your database without writing any SQL statements yourself!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

There are literally thousands of programming languages in existence today. Some are general-purpose programming languages that can be used for a variety of applications. Others are more niche, focusing on becoming an expert in one particular domain.\nThat last category is where you might find yourself when looking for a new language for network programming. These are programming languages that have been designed with specific domains in mind, such as networking or computer telephony. You might think there isn\\u2019t much scope for differentiation between these specialist programming languages, but there\\u2019s plenty out there!\nIf you\\u2019re still struggling to decide which is the best Go Programming Language for Networking, don\\u2019t worry!
