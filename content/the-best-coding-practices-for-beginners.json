  "summary": "One of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code is to use meaningful variable names. When you write code, you’re writing a set of instructions that a computer can execute. The computer needs to know what “clicks” means, so you have to write that in code. Always use const unless you have a good reason not to. Make sure to stay on top of current programming practices and languages. Some languages are trending upwards in popularity, while others are declining.",

From naming conventions to formatting standards, there are a ton of rules and best practices that experienced programmers follow to make sure their code is clean and easy to read by others. This can feel overwhelming at first. It might seem like there are a million things you need to know before you even get started on your first coding project. However, trust us \\u2013 it\\u2019s not as scary as it may seem! Following coding best practices will not only help you get through future programming classes more easily but also prepare you for a career in software development. In this blog post, we\\u2019ll explore some of the most important best practices for beginners who are learning to code.\"))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

This may sound silly since the code is only visible to you, but you\\u2019ll be surprised at how much easier it will be to understand your code when you use descriptive variable names. For example, say you want to track the number of times a user clicks a button. You could name that variable something like \\u201CbClicks\\u201D, but that doesn\\u2019t really convey what the variable is used for. Instead, you could name that variable \\u201Cclicks\\u201D and write a sentence about what the variable is being used for. You might say \\u201Ctracks the number of times a user clicks a button\\u201D. That way, when you go back to your code months later, you\\u2019ll be able to understand what\\u2019s going on more easily.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Comment your code\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Comments are lines of code that won\\u2019t be executed but are intended to provide more information about what\\u2019s happening in your code. Comments are one of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code. Every time you write code you should include a comment that describes what that code is doing. You\\u2019ll find that as you work through more advanced coding projects, you\\u2019ll be able to look back at your code and understand what\\u2019s happening more easily if you\\u2019ve used comments to explain everything.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Only use English in your code\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Coding isn\\u2019t just about writing syntax or using loops and loops. It\\u2019s also about writing logic that computers can understand. When you write code, you\\u2019re writing a set of instructions that a computer can execute. For example, if you want to enable a feature, you can write code that says \\u201Cif a user has a certain payment method, then enable that payment method.\\u201D These instructions are meant to be read and understood by a human, but they\\u2019re also meant to be read and understood by a computer. At the same time, there are certain things that are specific to the computer \\u2013 things like the names of variables, loops, and functions. For example, the computer needs to know what \\u201Cclicks\\u201D means, so you have to write that in code. But when you\\u2019re writing the code, you don\\u2019t want to use words that are specific to a human. You want to use words that are specific to the computer. When you write code, you can only use words that the computer understands. You can\\u2019t use any words that are specific to humans. That\\u2019s why when you write code, you have to only use English. You can\\u2019t use any other languages like Spanish, French, or Chinese.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Always use const unless you have a good reason not to\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Constants are values that you don\\u2019t want to change, so you declare them as a constant. This lets the computer know that this value won\\u2019t change over time, so it can make some calculations easier. When you\\u2019re learning how to code, you\\u2019ll find that you\\u2019ll use constants quite often. You\\u2019ll use them for things like the number of days in a month, the number of hours in a day, or any other value that you know won\\u2019t change. When you\\u2019re first learning how to code, it\\u2019s important to always use const unless you have a good reason not to. The only time you would not use const is if you wanted a value to change over time. For example, if a button needs to change colour over time, you wouldn\\u2019t use a constant. If a number needs to change depending on what someone inputs, you wouldn\\u2019t use a constant. You would always use a constant unless you have a good reason not to.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Make sure to stay on top of current programming practices and languages\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"One of the best practices for beginners who are learning to code is making sure to stay on top of current programming practices and languages. Some languages, like Python, have been around for decades, while others like Rust are brand new. Some languages are trending upwards in popularity, while others are declining. No matter which language or programming practices you decide to learn, it\\u2019s important to keep on top of what\\u2019s happening in the industry. You never know when a programming skill will come in handy! You also don\\u2019t want to be caught off guard if a potential employer asks you about your knowledge of certain languages or practices. Keep an eye on industry publications for new programming languages and trends, and make sure to follow industry leaders on social media.
