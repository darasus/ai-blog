When your dog comes when called, it means he will come back to you right away and not run away or chase something else. This will help keep your dog safe, especially if he\\u2019s prone to running away or chasing objects or other animals. It also helps with training and makes everyday interactions much easier than having to constantly chase after your pet.\nBut perhaps the most important reason why you should train your dog to come when called is because it might just save his life one day. In many cases, dogs that run away don\\u2019t get lost, they are just trying to find a way back home. Therefore, knowing how to train your dog to come when called can be the difference between him coming home safe and sound or getting lost forever. And let\\u2019s face it \\u2013 nobody wants that!`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s an alternative to going to court which involves winners and losers, winners and losers again. Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
