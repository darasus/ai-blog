It comes from a team of developers calling themselves the Cardano Foundation, based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015, the project began with an earlier version of the blockchain code named \\u201CC Haskell\\u201D and later changed to \\u201CCardano\\u201D. The inspiration for this name came from the home of leading scientist Galileo, who was born in Italy near the town of cardENDa .\nThe first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are mainly based on proof-of-work consensus algorithms. While being able to support transactions and data storage, these blockchains have inherent limitations on how many transactions can be verified per second, as well as how large individual blocks can be before becoming too difficult to process efficiently.\nFurthermore, there are issues with mining centralization that could lead to 51% attacks on smaller coins using PoW consensus algorithms alone.\nThis is why Cardano has introduced a new second generation proof-of-stake (POS) consensus algorithm called Ouroboros that allows miners to also act as transaction validators. This creates a system where no single party can control majority stakeholder voting rights or tamper with transaction histories to double spend their digital assets.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

That might sound like a lot, but it\\u2019s just a drop in the bucket compared to what we will see in future. As we enter into a new age of digital currencies and blockchain technology, we have seen an explosion of new tokens rise up to challenge old favorites like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nArmed with the knowledge that many industries will inevitably adopt blockchain technology, developers have created their own unique solutions to accelerate adoption of this exciting new technology. While most of these coins are little more than experimental testnets for improving upon existing blockchains like Ethereum \\u2013 others are legitimate competitors to the market leaders.\nRed hot at present is Litecoin \\u2013 an alternative version of Bitcoin with some key differences.

Each one has its own unique features and potential uses. There are thousands of different investors who have bought into the world of cryptocurrency, and each individual has their own reasons for investing in one coin or another. Some people invest in specific cryptocurrencies because they see a particular use case for that token; others invest in specific coins as a hedge against another token; and some invest based on the technical details and potential future use case for that token. There are many individuals who invest in specific tokens primarily because of their privacy features. Privacy is becoming a very important factor to consider when choosing which cryptocurrency to buy into, especially now that so many nefarious forces are targeting the cryptocurrency community with phishing attacks and hacks.

Ethereum has also proven to be an invaluable source of inspiration for other projects that are trying to build similar platforms with different objectives and features. One such project is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Although it might sound like another version of Ethereum, it is actually a continuation of the original Ethereum software, which was later on referred to as \\u201CETH\\u201D when its token achieved its own market cap and ticker symbol.\nEthereum Classic is essentially the original Ethereum codebase but with unrestricted miner checks, increased gas costs, and general code optimisations. Think of ETC as the anti-ETH; a blockchain that allows developers to deploy applications without any possible malicious interference from miners or anyone else who may control ETH in the future.
