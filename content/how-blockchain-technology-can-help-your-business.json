The blockchain technology can help companies overcome these challenges.\nThe blockchain technology can also help companies manage the risk of counterfeiting. It does this by creating a digital record of unique identifiers that are assigned to products as they move through the supply chain.\nYou can use blockchain to digitize supply chains.
