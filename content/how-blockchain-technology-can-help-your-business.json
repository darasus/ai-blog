In fact, blockchain can be cheaper than many centralized systems because there are no ongoing maintenance costs. A few seconds’ delay in getting that information could be critical and result in serious consequences. The data in a blockchain database is replicated and spread out over the network. However, a hacker is only able to access the data on one node on the blockchain, however, if the hacker gains access to 50% of the nodes, he/she can access 50% more of the data.",
