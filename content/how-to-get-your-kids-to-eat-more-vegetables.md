  Raising kids can be tough, especially when it comes to feeding them
  right.  In the battle of wills that is feeding your child healthy food,
  parents are often the losers. Kids have an uncanny ability to detect weakness
  and exploit it mercilessly, using their cuteness as a weapon of mass
  destruction until they get what they want.

  However, being a parent also gives you some advantages. You know your kid better than anyone else – probably even better than they know themselves – and you won’t hesitate to use that knowledge to get them eating veggies once and for all. 

  Whether they’re old enough to understand or not, children need to understand that green leaves are not just something funny that vines climb on. They’re also packed with vitamins and minerals which will keep your little one healthy if they eat more of them. Here are some tips on how you can do exactly that...

## Find The Right Veggies

When you’re trying to get your kids to eat more vegetables, you might feel like you’ve got two options – either they eat nothing at all or they eat everything in the produce section.
You don’t have to give up on veggies completely if your child doesn’t like them – but you shouldn’t push it either.

Some veggies are just easier for kids to accept than others. Even though all veggies are nutritious, some are more nutritious than others.

Broccoli and cauliflower are good examples of this. They’re both healthy – but broccoli is even better for you.

But broccoli is also a bit of a pain to eat for a small child. It’s not easy to chew, and it’s even harder to swallow. Cauliflower, on the other hand, is much easier to eat. It’s softer and has a much milder flavour.

## Start With Baby Steps

You can’t expect your child to go from eating nothing but pizza to eating a salad with croutons every night. You’ll just end up frustrated and they’ll end up hungry.

It’s important to start with baby steps and work your way up. You might want to start with smoothies or fruit snacks that combine some veggies with some fruit. That way, the kids get a bit of everything they need in one go.

You can also try hiding vegetables in other foods. It might sound sneaky, but it’s a great way to get your kids to start including more vegetables in their diet.

If you have them on your side, you’ll have made a great start to getting them eating better. Once they’ve got used to eating veggies, they’ll be able to start weeding out the ones they don’t like. At that point, you can encourage them to try new things.

## Sneak It In

As we’ve said, you shouldn’t try to sneak all the veggies into everything, but it can be a good way to start.
While you can’t just put broccoli in everything, you can add spices and herbs which have a similar effect.

Cinnamon, for example, is great for regulating blood sugar levels. It’s also a fantastic antioxidant. If you add cinnamon to your kid’s food, they won’t even know that they’re eating something good for them.

If you want to add a vegetable to something and make it barely noticeable, try adding spinach or avocado. They’re both very mild and will barely change the flavour of the food you’re adding them to.

## Don't Forget Dessert

If your kid doesn’t like vegetables, they’re probably not getting a lot of the vitamins and minerals they need.
If they’re sick often, or are just feeling really tired at the end of the day, there’s a chance they’re vitamin deficient. If you don’t do something about it, it could lead to bigger problems down the road.
If you’re having trouble getting your kid to eat vegetables, don’t forget dessert.
Dark chocolate has lots of antioxidants and will help boost your child’s immune system if you add it to their daily diet.
Blueberries are another great choice. They’re packed with vitamins and are a delicious dessert that’s easy to sneak into just about anything.

## Try New Foods Together

If you’re trying to get your kids to eat more veggies, you need to try new things.
It’s easy to fall into a rut with dinner and keep eating the same things over and over again. If you do that with veggies, your child is going to get bored and stop eating them. If you want them to keep eating their greens, you need to try a few new things.
Start with something simple and move up from there.
If your child has never eaten a pumpkin before, you don’t want to try baking a pie, but you can make a simple pumpkin soup or stew. They’ll get used to the taste and feel adventurous at the same time.

## Take A Break

Kids can be fickle, and they often go through phases where they just don’t want to eat.
If your child just isn’t interested in eating vegetables, there’s no point in forcing them.
If you force them, they’ll just push them away and resent you for it.
Instead, take a break and try again later.
Sometimes kids just need to take a break from eating vegetables until they’re ready to come back to them again.
If you keep trying to get your kid to eat veggies, it’ll only push them away until they’re completely done with eating anything that isn’t pizza.
Give them time and you might find that they’re ready to try vegetables again.

## Summing Up

Kids are fickle and they don’t always want to eat what’s good for them. If you want them to start getting more vegetables in their diet, though, you need to start working on it early and be patient.
If you’re patient, your child will learn to love vegetables and will be grateful for you later on. If they don’t start eating more vegetables when they’re little, though, they might end up having some health issues later on in life.
If your child isn’t eating vegetables, don’t worry. You can help them start eating more vegetables in no time by trying different things. Just be patient and keep trying and your child will be eating their greens in no time.
