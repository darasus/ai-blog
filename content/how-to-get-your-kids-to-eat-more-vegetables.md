If you're like most parents, you probably have a hard time getting your kids to eat their vegetables. Here are a few tips to get them to eat more vegetables:

1. Let them choose their own vegetables.

If you give them a choice of what vegetables they want to eat, they're more likely to eat them.

2. Serve vegetables with their favorite foods.

If you're serving a food that they love, they're more likely to eat the vegetables if they're served with it.

3. Hide vegetables in their favorite foods.

If you're sneaky about it, they'll never know that they're eating vegetables. Try hiding them in their favorite sauces or soups.

4. Make vegetables fun.

If you make eating vegetables fun, they'll be more likely to eat them. Try using fun shaped cookie cutters to make vegetable shapes or make a veggie dip with their favorite colors.

5. Be a good role model.

If you're eating your vegetables, they're more likely to want to eat them too. So make sure you're eating your veggies at every meal!
