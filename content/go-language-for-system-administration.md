System administration in the Go programming language is a breeze. The language was designed with system administration in mind, and as such, it offers a number of features that make it ideal for this purpose. For example, Go's built-in concurrency support makes it easy to write programs that can take advantage of multiple cores, and its support for network programming makes it easy to write programs that can communicate with other systems.

In addition, Go comes with a number of tools that make it easy to manage and deploy Go programs. For example, the go tool can be used to fetch, build, and install Go programs. The go tool can also be used to manage dependencies, and to run tests.

If you're looking for a language that makes system administration easy, then Go is definitely worth considering.
