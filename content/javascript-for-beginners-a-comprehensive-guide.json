Its simple syntax and powerful features have made it especially popular among programmers who specialize in building compilers and interpreters.\nGo is a general-purpose programming language with support for structured methods, visibility qualifiers, and embedded type definitions. It\\u2019s a statically typed language with support for interfaces,Ad hoc polymorphism, and type embedding.\nIn this blog post, we explore the considerations you need to make when choosing a programming language for GUI programming.
