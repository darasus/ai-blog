Distributed computing is a branch of computer science that deals with problem-solving tasks that cannot be solved by analyzing and working with them individually. Distributed computing relies on the collective processing power and memory of many computers rather than just one. Everything from big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, neural networks, speech recognition, and more involve distributed computing.\nA great example of distributed computing is file sharing. If you upload a file to Dropbox or Google Drive, it\\u2019s stored on multiple servers at once rather than locally on your hard drive or in a folder on your desktop like normal files.
