The rise of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Happn has only hastened this tendency. In fact, an article in Fast Company suggests that millennials are so preoccupied with online dating that they now spend more time on it than on any other leisure activity besides watching TV or listening to music.\nOn top of all this, many couples now meet their partners online \\u2013 a third of marriages in the U.S. start with either partner meeting their future spouse through an online dating site or app. While it\\u2019s easy to feel pressured into signing up for these services if you don\\u2019t have friends who are single and looking for love, being in a relationship with someone who does use them regularly can be challenging at times.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Occupational dog toys are designed to help keep your dog mentally stimulated so they don\\u2019t get bored and start chewing on your shoes or digging up the yard. But even with all of these fantastic innovations, most dogs will eventually get tired of playing with their toys and will look for something more interesting. This is where training comes in!\nTo train your dog means to instruct them in some behavior that you want them to repeat consistently in different situations. Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like \\u201Csit\\u201D or \\u201Cstay,\\u201D or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard.
