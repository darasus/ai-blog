summary: An index fund is a type of mutual fund that is designed to track the
  performance of a certain index. Index funds are passively managed, meaning
  that the fund’s manager does not actively try to select stocks that they think
  will outperform the market. This makes the fund extremely low cost and easy to
  manage. They are also very tax efficient and require very little maintenance
  on your part. The S&P 500 index is the most popular index fund, which is made
  up of the 500 largest companies in the United States by market capitalization.

  The stock market can be frightening. It is easy to get caught up in the
  moment and panic when it drops, or get overly excited when it rises. But if
  you take a step back and look at investing from a long-term perspective,
  things are not as scary. In fact, index funds are a great way to invest your
  money for the long run. 

  It is natural to have some fear or apprehension about putting your hard-earned money at risk by investing in the stock market. After all, many people witnessed the bursting of the dotcom bubble first hand and saw their retirement accounts plummet as a result. However, that does not mean you should avoid investing in stocks altogether—not even with recent recession still fresh on everyone’s mind.

## What is an index fund?

An index fund is a type of mutual fund that is designed to track the performance of a certain index. There are many different types of indexes, but the most popular is the S&P 500 index, which is made up of the 500 largest companies in the United States by market capitalization. Other popular indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the Russell 2000, and the NASDAQ. You can invest in index funds through a brokerage account, mutual fund company, or even with a robo-advisor. Index funds are passively managed, meaning that the fund’s manager does not actively try to select stocks that they think will outperform the market. Rather, they just buy stocks from all the companies in the index. This makes the fund extremely low cost and easy to manage.

## Why you should invest in index funds

There are many reasons why you should invest in index funds, but the most important one is that you are likely to beat the average investor with a basic, low-cost index fund. While the average investor actually underperforms the market, index funds provide you with an easy way to catch up because they are not actively managed. Index funds are also very tax efficient and require very little maintenance on your part. They are extremely low cost and easy to manage. Finally, they are a great option if you are looking to invest for the long term. If you hold onto your index fund for many years, you are likely to outperform many actively managed funds that are constantly switching their investment strategies.

## How to invest in index funds

There are a few different ways that you can invest in index funds, but most of them require a significant amount of money. For example, if you want to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), you would need at least $10,000 because that is the minimum investment requirement for most ETFs. If you want to buy mutual funds, you can do so with as little as $1,000 since most mutual funds do not require a minimum investment. You can also find robo-advisors that will let you invest for free with as little as $100.

If you want to invest in index funds, you should first figure out what type of index fund you want to invest in. While there are many types of indexes, the two most popular are the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). While both indexes have their pros and cons, the S&P 500 is the most common index fund, so it is generally a good place to start. Once you have figured out which index fund you want to invest in, you can open an account at a brokerage firm with as little as $1.

## How to pick your index fund

Before you pick your index fund, you need to understand that not all index funds are created equal. Some index funds are more heavily weighted towards larger companies, while others are more evenly distributed across all industries. Therefore, you need to pick an index fund that is appropriate for your risk tolerance and future goals. For example, if you are saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, you might be better off choosing an index fund that is more heavily weighted towards large-cap stocks. However, if you are saving to buy a house in the next few years, you might want to pick an index fund that is weighted towards smaller companies.

If you are not sure which index fund to pick, you can research fund companies such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price and find out which funds they have available. You can also use online tools such as Morningstar to compare different funds and find one that is appropriate for your goals.

## Limitations of investing in index funds

While index funds are a great way to invest, they do come with some limitations. First, you need to make sure that you are investing in a diversified index fund that includes stocks from all industries. If you put all your money in one index fund, you are taking on too much risk and are likely to lose money if that index fund performs poorly. Index funds are also not a get-rich-quick scheme. While you can outperform the market over the long haul, you will not make any spectacular gains overnight. If you are looking for a quick way to make money, index funds are not the right choice.
