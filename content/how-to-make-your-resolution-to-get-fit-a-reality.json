The answer is: quite a lot. A single photograph has the power to change opinions, shape perceptions, and even alter the course of history.\nLet\\u2019s take for example, the most iconic cat photos of all time; whether you love them or hate them, their fame cannot be denied. These are images that have been shared on social media sites and printed on t-shirts and posters across the globe. And we think they\\u2019re pretty iconic!\nAny cat lover will tell you that cats have a way of making their presence known in an almost ethereal manner. Perhaps it is because cats are so often independent and solitary creatures who keep to themselves when they wish to remain undetected; or maybe it is because as fellow feline lovers know personally, there is something about these sly little creatures that seem to tap into some strange wavelength only accessible to them. Whatever the reason may be, there\\u2019s no denying that cats have left an everlasting mark on society through their ability to conquer our imaginations with just a simple look or gesture.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

Women now account for nearly two-thirds of all students enrolling in postsecondary education, and that number is only growing.\nIn light of this increased access to education among women, it\\u2019s no surprise that more and more women are moving into professions once dominated by men. The unfortunate consequence is that we are now seeing widespread misrepresentation of facts related to gender wage gaps, particularly when it comes to the so-called \\u201Cgender wage gap\\u201D as it applies to compensation for work done by men versus women.\nIf you read or listen to much mainstream media coverage on this topic, you would likely come away with the belief that there is a veritable conspiracy among employers to pay women less than men for doing the same job because of their gender.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
