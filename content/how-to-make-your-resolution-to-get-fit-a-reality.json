Heck, most dogs will go their entire lives without ever picking something up and then purposefully putting it somewhere else.\nIf you want to train your dog to drop something on command, you\\u2019ll need to focus a bit on simple tricks like that. After all, it isn\\u2019t exactly the kind of thing they\\u2019re going to be motivated to do by instinct on their own. In addition, there are some pretty great benefits from training your dog this skill.\nWhen you train your dog to drop something on command, it will help them in a number of areas later in life. For starters, teaching them how to put an object down gently as opposed readying it more often than not means they won\\u2019t hurt their teeth or gums when they chew on things later in life. It also makes things like vet checkups easier and even makes housebreaking much faster when combined with other tricks like \\u2018sit\\u2019 and \\u2018stay\\u2019.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

But even with all of these fantastic innovations, most dogs will eventually get tired of playing with their toys and will look for something more interesting. This is where training comes in!\nTo train your dog means to instruct them in some behavior that you want them to repeat consistently in different situations. Training gives your dog a purpose, and it makes things easier on both of you when you have a well-trained pooch at home (or anywhere else). Training can be as simple as teaching your dog some basic commands like \\u201Csit\\u201D or \\u201Cstay,\\u201D or it can be something much more advanced like teaching them to come when called from the other side of the yard.

Mediators do not take sides; they do not give advice; and they don\\u2019t recommend what a person should do. Instead, the mediator facilitates communication between two or more parties by encouraging them to share their ideas and feelings honestly and constructively.\nMediation can be used at any stage of conflict -- before litigation begins or during settlement discussions after lawsuit is filed.
