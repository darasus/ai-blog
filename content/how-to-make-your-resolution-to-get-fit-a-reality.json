You pay for it either directly by paying the mediator or indirectly by paying the lawyers. But how much does mediation cost?\nMediation costs will vary depending on where you live, the nature of your dispute, and the reputation of the mediator or firm you choose to take on your case.\nWhile some attorneys may offer their clients a choice between litigation and a certain number of hours of mediation at a reduced rate as an alternative to litigation, most attorneys charge their standard rates for mediation services.\nThe hourly rate for a private mediator may range from $100 per hour to $300 per hour or more; however, most mediators will have standard market rates that fall within that range. Many corporations and nonprofit organizations negotiate group discounts when contracting with third-party mediation services. In general, expect to spend $200 to $500 per party for a one-day mediation session with two neutral mediators and an independent arbiter.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
