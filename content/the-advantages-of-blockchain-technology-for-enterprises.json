When applied to supply chain management, blockchain can help companies more accurately document and track assets and transactions that occur along the supply chain.

A report from the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) estimated that brands lost $19.8 billion to ad fraud in 2018 and predict that figure will rise to $33 billion in 2019. Blockchain technology can help businesses track ad spend and malicious activity by creating an immutable record of ad spend and impressions across the supply chain, including third-party networks and exchanges.

So much of what makes a coin great doesn\\u2019t come from its technology or usage as much as its real-world potential.\nWhen evaluating a cryptocurrency for long-term investment, we ask ourselves: How does this token solve a real problem? Does it have the potential to be adopted by many users? Is there an opportunity for this coin to appreciate in value? If you can answer yes to all of these questions, you may be interested in investing in Stellar \\u2014 here\\u2019s why:`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

It\\u2019s an open source software that operates smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), and other programs. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with specific instructions that can be fulfilled when certain conditions are met. These contracts operate on the principles of if this, then that; if not, then this. This makes it so that once the pre-set conditions have been met, the contract will execute automatically without further input from any third party. Ethereum supports Turing complete programming and can execute code in any language because of its instruction sets and virtual machines.\nEthereum has become one of the most popular blockchain networks after Bitcoin because of its support for smart contracts, which make up a huge part of why blockchain technology is so revolutionary. In this article, you\\u2019ll learn more about what Ethereum is and its unique benefits as well as potential challenges it faces going forward in adoption and development.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
