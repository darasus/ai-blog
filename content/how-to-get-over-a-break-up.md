When a relationship ends, it can be difficult to cope. You may feel a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and relief. It can be hard to let go of someone you cared for, but there are ways to move on.

Give yourself time to grieve. It’s normal to feel sad and even angry after a break-up. Allow yourself to feel these emotions and cry if you need to. Don’t try to bottle up your feelings.

Talk about what happened. Talk to a friend or family member about your break-up. It can be helpful to talk about what happened and how you’re feeling.

Avoid contact with your ex. If possible, avoid contact with your ex. This includes social media and mutual friends. Seeing them will only make it harder to move on.

Do something for yourself. After a break-up, it’s important to do something for yourself. This can be anything from getting a new haircut to taking a trip. Do something that makes you happy and helps you move on.

Focus on the future. Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on the future. Think about what you want and what you’re looking for in a partner. This will help you move on from your break-up.
