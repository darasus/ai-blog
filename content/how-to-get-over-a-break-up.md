## Talk to Someone

When you’re going through a breakup, it’s important to talk to someone about how you’re feeling so you don’t keep it all bottled up inside. Keeping all of your emotions inside is going to make you feel even more isolated, depressed and it might even lead to you feeling suicidal. If you don’t have anyone to talk to, there are some great online forums where you can go to get some advice and support from others who have been in your situation. You can also talk to a professional with a service like Talkspace and they can help you get to a place of peace.

Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Whatever you do, don’t let the negative thoughts and feelings of a break-up consume you. You have to have your guard up to protect yourself from going too far into the sadness. Letting it consume you will only cause more damage and could make the healing process take much longer.

## Exercise

Exercising is one of the best things you can do for yourself when you’re going through a breakup. Not only will it help reduce your stress, but it will also help you to sleep better at night. Exercise will help you to feel better about yourself, and it will help you to become a better version of yourself after the break-up. If you have a gym membership or if there is a local gym near you that has a reduced rate for first-timers, going to the gym will help you to clear your mind and it will give you something to do with your time.

Being active will also help you to increase your endorphin levels which will make you feel less depressed and more confident in yourself. Exercise can be whatever you want it to be. You can go for a hike, swim, bike, walk or do yoga. Anything that gets your heart pumping and your blood flowing will help you feel better after the break-up.

## Write in a Diary or Journal

When you’re going through a break-up, it can feel like you’re going crazy. You might feel like you’re losing control of yourself and there is nothing you can do about it. One way that you can get your mind back to a place of peace is to write in a journal or diary. Not only will this help you to get your feelings, thoughts and emotions out, but it will also give you a record of how you were feeling at the time of the break-up. Although it might feel like you’re losing control, it’s important to remember that you are always in control of yourself.

Keeping a journal is a very cathartic way to heal after a break-up and it will also give you something to look back on when you need to reflect on that time in your life. Not only will it be a reminder of how far you’ve come since that time, but it will also be a way for you to see how much you have grown and changed since then.

## Don’t Stalk Or Haunt Your Ex

During and after a break-up, it’s very easy to get lost in the temptation to stalk and haunt your ex. Perhaps you want to see if they are dating someone new, or maybe you want to know what they are up to. Whatever your reason may be, it’s extremely unhealthy to be stalking or haunting your ex. Not only will this put you in danger of getting caught and put your privacy at risk, but it will also make you look desperate.
If you’re tempted to look at your ex’s social media accounts, phone calls, texts and other forms of communication, close the accounts and delete the contact information instead. Don’t let yourself fall into the temptation of stalking and haunting your ex because it’s only going to hurt you more in the long run.

## Watch Something That Makes You Happy

There’s no better time to indulge in your favourite TV show or movie now that you’re single. However, you don’t have to watch something that makes you sad or depressed. Instead, pick a TV show or movie that will make you happy. If you like a good cry, pick a tearjerker, or if you want to laugh, pick a comedy. Whatever you do, don’t watch something that will make you feel more depressed or sad.

As you’re watching, really immerse yourself in the show or movie and put yourself in the situation. You can use this as a way to escape from your real life and to put your current situation behind you. Indulging in your favourite TV show or movie can be a great way to help you get over a break-up because it will take your mind off your current emotions and help you to focus on something else.

## Don’t Tarry, Just Move On

When you go through a break-up, it’s important to not tarry on it. Don’t let yourself spend too much time dwelling on the fact that you’re single and alone because it will make the healing process longer. While it’s okay to let yourself grieve for the relationship that has ended, you don’t want to let it hold you back from meeting new people and moving forward with your life.

Don’t be afraid to go out and meet new people, and don’t let the thought of meeting someone new scare you. Remember that you are awesome and you deserve to date and be with someone who sees that too. You might meet the love of your life while you’re out and about and you might not, but either way you have gone through the process of moving on.

## Conclusion

Getting over a break-up is sometimes the hardest thing you’ll ever have to do, but it will be worth it in the end. Break-ups can be emotionally damaging, and you may go through some very dark times. However, you will come out of it a stronger and wiser person. Break-ups teach us a lot about ourselves, and they will make us better people in the long run.

Remember that you are worthy of love, and you will find someone who will appreciate you for who you are. It’s important to know that you have to go through these things in life in order to grow as a person and to mature. No one ever said that life would be easy, and break-ups are definitely hard, but they will make you stronger and better in the long run.
