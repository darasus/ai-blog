You can use any type of milk \\u2014 from skim to whole to 2 percent. The type of milk you use will not affect the taste of your scrambled eggs, so use whatever type you want.

To poach an egg, start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add some vinegar to the water to make the egg whites tighter and prevent the egg from spreading out in the water. Then, crack an egg and gently lower it into the water. Poached eggs should be kept at a low simmer, so you might have to turn down the heat a bit when you add the egg to the water. If you like your eggs well done, then keep them in the water for about three to four minutes. If you prefer a softer poached egg, then take it out after two minutes.

To cook a sunny side up, start by heating about two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet. If you want to get the yolk perfect, then use an oil with a high smoke point. Next, crack an egg into the skillet and cover the egg with a lid. Let the egg cook until the white is completely firm, but don\\u2019t let the yolk get too dark. If the yolk is getting too dark, then you can take the lid off.

You can use any type of bread for an egg sandwich, but you might want to choose a softer type of bread if you want to top the sandwich with eggs. Once you\\u2019ve got your bread ready, crack some eggs into a pan and cook them. You can use a variety of toppings for the sandwich, such as cheese or bacon.

If so, that\\u2019s great! A plant based diet is extremely beneficial for your health and can reduce your risk of developing serious diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nA plant-based diet is one that focuses on plants for your main sources of food. This means lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and plants like lettuce, onion and garlic. In contrast, a diet that focuses on animal-based foods is what most people eat now \\u2013 lots of red meat, chicken, eggs and dairy products like milk and cheese.\nA plant based diet has many well-documented benefits including lowering the risk of heart disease and stroke; reducing your risk of developing type 2 diabetes; helping to manage your weight; improving your blood sugar control; reducing your cholesterol levels; preventing certain cancers such as colon cancer; and lowering your risk of dying from any cause.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
