You can cook scrambled eggs with milk, eggs or even just water. Using milk or water is the best way to cook scrambled eggs because it gives them a soft texture, as opposed to using just eggs, which will result in hard and rubbery scrambled eggs. You can use any type of milk \\u2014 from skim to whole to 2 percent. The type of milk you use will not affect the taste of your scrambled eggs, so use whatever type you want. If you want to add some extra flavor to your scrambled eggs, try adding some herbs or spices before you start whisking.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Poached Eggs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Poaching is a very easy way to cook eggs, and the results are soft and moist. To poach an egg, start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add some vinegar to the water to make the egg whites tighter and prevent the egg from spreading out in the water. Then, crack an egg and gently lower it into the water. Poached eggs should be kept at a low simmer, so you might have to turn down the heat a bit when you add the egg to the water. If you like your eggs well done, then keep them in the water for about three to four minutes. If you prefer a softer poached egg, then take it out after two minutes. The yolk of your poached egg should be runny, so if you want a firmer yolk, then you can raise the water temperature slightly or keep the egg in the water for a few extra seconds.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Sunny Side Up Eggs\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you want to cook the yolk so that it\\u2019s soft and gooey, but the white is still slightly firm and is the classic, sunny-side up egg. To cook a sunny side up, start by heating about two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet. If you want to get the yolk perfect, then use an oil with a high smoke point. Next, crack an egg into the skillet and cover the egg with a lid. Let the egg cook until the white is completely firm, but don\\u2019t let the yolk get too dark. If the yolk is getting too dark, then you can take the lid off. The perfect sunny side up egg will have a soft yolk, but the white will still be slightly firm.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"How to Make Egg Sandwich: Toast and eggs?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you want something simple and quick to eat for breakfast, you can make a sandwich with toast and eggs. To make an egg sandwich, start by slicing a piece of bread in half or in fourths, depending on how you prefer to eat your sandwich. You can use any type of bread for an egg sandwich, but you might want to choose a softer type of bread if you want to top the sandwich with eggs. Once you\\u2019ve got your bread ready, crack some eggs into a pan and cook them. You can use a variety of toppings for the sandwich, such as cheese or bacon. Toast the bread until it\\u2019s golden brown, and then put the egg on one slice of the bread and your toppings on the other slice.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Tips to ensure the best way to cook eggs\"),mdx(\"ul\",null,mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"Eggs should be kept in the fridge and eaten within seven days.\"),mdx(\"li\",{parentName:\"ul\"},\"To keep your eggs fresh and safe to eat, make sure to store them in their carton and not the egg container.
