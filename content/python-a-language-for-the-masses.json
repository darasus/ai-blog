  "intro": "Python is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1991. It’s easy to read and understand and has a much simpler syntax than other programming languages such as C or Java. Its simple syntax, readability, and general ease of use have made Python an extremely popular choice for new programmers. According to the census of programming languages from PYPL, Python is the third most widely used programming language globally with a usage of about 20%. Furthermore, Python was also identified as one of the top 10 fastest growing computer languages. This post will explain why you should learn Python, teach you everything you need to know about this wonderful coding language, and provide some resources for getting started. So keep reading to discover more about this awesome programming",
  "content": "## What can you do with Python?\n\nWith Python, you can do anything from website development to machine learning to scientific computing and more. You can even use Python to create video games! This flexibility is one of the main reasons why Python is so popular. However, this is not to say that Python is suitable for every situation. The best way to decide if Python is right for you is to understand its strengths and weaknesses. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of Python to get a better sense of the language.\n\nPros: - Versatility - As discussed, Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks. This is due to the fact that Python has a very general syntax compared to other programming languages.\n- Readability - Python syntax is extremely readable. While Python has a lot of functionality compared to other languages, the syntax has simpler structure and is much easier to understand. This makes Python great for beginners who want to get started with programming but don’t know where to start.\n- Ease of Use - Python has a very straightforward code format that is designed to be easy to understand. Additionally, Python is also designed to be very extensible. This means that you can build new functionality on top of existing code.\n- Extensive Library - One of the best things about Python is that it has a massive library of pre-written code that you can use to build your projects. This allows you to save time and get your projects going quicker than if you started from scratch.\n\nCons: - Speed - One disadvantage of Python is that it is not the fastest programming language. While this doesn’t really matter for most small and medium projects, it could be an issue for very large-scale projects.\n- Resources - Another disadvantage of Python is that it doesn’t have the best resources compared to other languages. While the libraries and community are extremely helpful, there are not as many books, courses, or other material as other languages.\n\n## Why learn Python?\n\nIf you’re still not convinced that Python is the right language for you, let’s look at a few reasons why Python is a great choice for a beginner programmer.\n- A great first language - Python is an excellent language for beginners to learn.
