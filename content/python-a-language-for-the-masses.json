As with any job, coders have to balance the amount of time spent coding as well as the quality and efficiency of that coding. It is an ongoing challenge to stay organized and productive throughout the day. The good news is that there are many tools out there that make the lives of developers easier. These tools make tasks like code organization, file sharing, debugging, and testing much simpler.\nCoding tools help developers in multiple ways. They streamline processes such codification, debugging, testing, and management of code libraries. Additionally, these tools reduce redundancy and increase efficiency across projects and teams as a whole rather than individually.
