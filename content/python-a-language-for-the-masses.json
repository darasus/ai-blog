The market for software engineers continues to grow at a rapid pace, with demand expected to increase by another 280,000 jobs by 2022. Prospective software engineers therefore have many options when it comes to pursuing their career. Computer science programs generally provide an excellent foundation for those interested in pursuing software engineering as a specific career path, but these programs alone often aren\\u2019t enough.\nPrograms specifically tailored toward software engineering can help you gain the skills and training you need to succeed in this field. There are many different types of software engineer positions available today, from front end development to data mining and artificial intelligence (AI).

Unfortunately, the reality is quite different.\nThere are numerous choices for deploying Java applications: You can use a traditional staging environment with manual processes or a continuous integration server to automate your build processes with code repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your source code in an isolated environment with some third-party tools like Bintray or Nexus Repository Manager to deploy static assets on CDNs like AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN) or New Relic Insights as an additional monitoring solution if you don\\u2019t have services like StatsD, Datadog and Prometheus installed on your servers.\nIn this blog post we take a look at several different ways you can deploy Java applications.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

You might already know some other languages or have experience with concurrency so you probably are wondering how does the Go programming language help with concurrent programming.\nIf you are just getting started with Go, it might feel like a steep learning curve if you\\u2019ve never used its features before. However, as soon as you learn about channels and see how easy it is to implement them, things start making much more sense. Concurrent programming is an extremely complex topic that requires careful planning to avoid race conditions and deadlocks. Fortunately, Go offers a set of standard library packages for concurrent tasks so that developers can focus on writing code instead of reinventing the wheel every time they create a new project. Let\\u2019s take a closer look at why we need concurrent programs and what Go has to offer in this regard.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
