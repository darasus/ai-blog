Instead of this, mediation helps both parties achieve a resolution that works for both of them. In mediation you have the opportunity to express your needs and goals while also listening carefully to the other party and considering their needs and goals as well.\nMediation is confidential so that parties can speak openly about their concerns, fears, and desires without fear of retribution. The mediator does not take sides but rather assists the parties in exploring possible solutions to resolve the conflict in a way that works for both of them.\nAn added benefit of mediation is that it allows people on opposing sides of a dispute see each other as human beings with needs, wants and concerns just like they have. They learn cooperation instead of confrontation\\u2026`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
