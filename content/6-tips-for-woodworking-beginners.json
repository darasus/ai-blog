It is an alternative to going to court for resolving disputes between parties, businesses, or individuals. Unlike arbitration, mediation does not involve any third party whose decision becomes final. Instead, it is a collaborative process where the mediator acts as a neutral intermediary and assists the conflicting parties negotiate an agreement that suits both of them. The mediator does not take sides and helps the parties understand their own interests while also exploring opportunities for a mutually beneficial resolution of the issues in conflict.\nMediation can be helpful when you have a tricky situation with someone else that doesn\\u2019t involve crime or violence but still has the potential to get out of hand if left unresolved. Mediation might not be your first thought as an option in resolving conflict because of its non-adversarial nature. However, it can be a very useful tool and quite effective in most cases given its collaborative nature which gives both parties more input into finding a solution they are comfortable with and happy with at the same time.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",

They are seen as independent creatures that are self-sufficient and don\\u2019t need constant interaction from humans to be happy. However, owning a cat is fast becoming one of the most common household pets in the world. Almost a third of all households now own at least one cat, with many seeing them as more than just an independent pet but also a friend.Now let\\u2019s get this out of the way: Most people who own cats would tell you they do so because they love them. But why? What is it about these often aloof creatures that prompts so many people to give up their time, attention and money to keep one as a pet?

This way, the disputants can agree on a fair outcome and put an end to their disagreements.\nIf you are part of an organization that is going through a lot of conflict right now (or any time soon), mediation might be a good solution for reducing tensions, smoothing things over and getting everyone back on track.

You spend time getting to know each other and spending time together as much as possible. But things can change once you enter a committed relationship or get married. Stressors from work, family, friends and other responsibilities may arise, putting stress on your relationship. This is when green-eyed monster envy creeps in and can have a negative impact on your partner.\nThere are many different types of relationships: friendships, casual dating or serious partners. Regardless of what type of relationships you have with another person, envy probably won\\u2019t be far behind if they are important to you. Envy is one of the seven deadly sins for good reason. When we experience envy in a relationship it creates distrust, resentment and can ultimately end things prematurely before they even really begin.
