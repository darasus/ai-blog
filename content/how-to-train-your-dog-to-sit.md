intro: >-
  Dogs are intelligent animals with a natural desire to please their human
  companions. If you take the time to understand what motivates them and reward
  them for good behavior, they will respond by trying harder next time.

  If you're willing to put in the time and effort, almost any dog can be trained to sit on command. It's just a matter of identifying your dog’s motivation and rewarding him for the behaviors that you like. With consistent training sessions every day or two, your dog will learn how to sit in no time at all.

  Training your dog doesn’t have to be difficult or stressful – it just requires commitment and patience from both of you. The more straightforward training techniques like marker words, positive reinforcement and treat rewards should get your dog responding obediently within a few weeks.

## Step 1: Pick A Marker Word

The first step in teaching your dog to sit is to pick a marker word that he’ll associate with the behavior. You might choose “sit” or “down”, but you could use any word as long as you consistently associate it with the behavior. 

For example, let’s say that every time your dog sits, you mark the behavior with your chosen word. After a few repetitions, your dog will start to associate that word with the behavior. Your dog will then try even harder to sit next time because he wants to earn the reward that comes with that word.

## Step 2: Reward Consistent Behavior

One of the most important aspects of training your dog is rewarding him for consistently good behavior. You want him to associate positive feelings with the actions you want him to repeat. Dogs thrive on routine and predictability, so it’s important that your training sessions are consistent each time. 

Each time your dog sits when you ask him to, mark the behavior with your verbal marker word and reward him with a treat or petting. Make sure that the reward comes right after he sits, so he can associate the reward with the behavior.

## Step 3: Reinforce The Behavior You Like

One of the most common mistakes that people make when training their dogs is only rewarding good behavior part of the time. Although rewarding your dog every time he sits might seem like a good idea, it’s actually a bad training technique. Your dog will pick up on this inconsistency and become increasingly confused.

This is especially true for puppies, as they are still figuring out how the world works. If you reward your dog for sitting 80% of the time and ignore his attempts to sit the other 20%, he won’t know what he did wrong. He’ll just know that he isn’t getting a treat every time he tries to sit.

## Step 4: Mix It Up With Games

Games are a fun way to mix up your dog training and help your dog associate positive feelings with training. If you’ve been rewarding your dog for sitting with treats each time, mix it up with a game next time and see how he responds.

For example, you could play hide-and-seek with your dog by placing a treat somewhere he can’t easily access. Let him sniff the treat out, but don’t let him eat it. Once he’s found the treat, let him eat it and then repeat the game.

## Step 5: Train Your Dog To Sit And Stay

Once your dog knows how to sit, you can begin to teach him to stay seated until you release him. This is a useful command for a variety of different situations, such as waiting by the door when someone comes to the house.

First, start with your dog in a sitting position. Then, use your marker word and reward him for staying in the sit position. After a few repetitions, stand up and see if he stays in the sit position. Once he consistently remains in the sitting position, try removing your foot from the ground and see if he remains in the sit position.

Once your dog consistently sits and stays in the sitting position, you can progress to sitting and staying in a variety of environments with different distractions. You can even try sitting and staying with a leash on, as this is a useful command for training dogs to walk on a leash without pulling.

## Conclusion

Dogs are intelligent animals who thrive on routine and structure. By training your dog regularly and consistently, you can help him stay calm and happy. Teaching your dog to sit on command is a great place to start, as this is a useful command that can be applied in almost any situation. Once your dog knows how to sit, you can progress to teaching more advanced behaviors.

The more straightforward training techniques like marker words, positive reinforcement and treat rewards should get your dog responding obediently within a few weeks. If your dog seems particularly stubborn or unresponsive, try mixing things up with new games and activities to help him relax and enjoy the training sessions more.
