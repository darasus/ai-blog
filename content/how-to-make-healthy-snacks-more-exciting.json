Whether you\\u2019re meeting friends for a bite to eat after work, happy hour with coworkers or date night with your significant other, there are many restaurants that offer an experience that\\u2019s enjoyable and hassle-free. However, eating out \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s at a fast food joint, casual chain or upscale eatery \\u2014 isn\\u2019t always the healthiest option.\nIn fact, many restaurants serve high-calorie foods that aren\\u2019t particularly good for you.
