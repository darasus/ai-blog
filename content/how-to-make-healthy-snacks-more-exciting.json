It is not easy raising healthy kids when almost everywhere we look there are temptations around every corner trying their best to get us to buy something else instead.\nThe good news is that this is not an impossible task. With the right balance of encouragement, support, and guidance from trusted parenting sources, we can all help our kids grow up with healthier habits than we currently have as adults.

You can just eat the way you usually do. The only difference will be that you are eating the healthy snacks your child is trying.\nAs you are doing this, you can talk to your child about why you eat the way you do, and let them know you are trying new things because you want to be healthy.

If you have a little one who can\\u2019t help out in the kitchen, you can still try changing things up by letting your other kids help you make the healthy snacks their siblings eat.\nIf your kids are too young to help with making healthy snacks, you can still try letting them help you pick out what you want to buy.

There will be times when the healthy snacks aren\\u2019t enough, and there will be times when your child just wants something different.\nIf you follow these tips, you can make healthy snacks more exciting for your child and help them find a healthy balance in their diet that they can maintain for a lifetime.`))}MDXContent.isMDXComponent=!0;\n",
