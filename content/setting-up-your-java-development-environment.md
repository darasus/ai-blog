## How to set up your Java development environment?

When you are developing an application, you need to set up your Java environment. This means that you need to install all of the tools and software required to get your computer ready to code. There are several ways to do this depending on the operating system you use and the version of Java that you want to use. You can use different combinations of software depending on your needs and the project you are working on. 

First, you need to determine where you want to store the code for your project. Your options include storing the code on your computer’s hard drive, using a code hosting service like GitHub, or using an internet-connected device like a Raspberry Pi. You also need to decide if you want to use open source or proprietary software for your development environment. Open source software is usually free to use and can usually be modified by the user. Proprietary software, on the other hand, is usually not free to use but comes with helpful support options. Finally, you need to decide what programming language you want to use.
