  The internet is rapidly growing larger and more complex. As of June 2018,
  there are approximately 3.4 billion users globally, with that number
  continuing to grow by the day. With so many different people using the
  internet, it’s no surprise that big tech companies have begun to thrive once
  again.

  At its core, the internet is an exchange of information between computers. In practice, this means a website like Google can store all of its user-friendly information online and anyone who wants to access it simply needs to type in a URL or visit a site directly. However, as more people use the internet and begin interacting with various programs and applications on websites, things become slightly more complicated. 

  As you probably know if you browse social media sites or read news articles online frequently, there are now several different “languages” being used on websites to make them more interactive. These programming languages are known as HTML5, CSS3, JS/JavaScript, and JSON – all acronyms that stand for something but might not mean much to most users at first glance. 

  However, these languages make up what is known as web content management systems (WCMS). A WCMS is essentially software that allows developers to create websites of any kind without having to code each page from scratch every time they want to launch a new one.

  Here’s a brief breakdown of what big tech companies and the future of the internet look like today:

## Google

Google is the world’s most popular search engine, internet service provider (ISP), and website hosting provider. If you’re reading this article right now, you’re likely using Google on a daily basis. Beyond its “free” services, Google makes money through advertisements on its own websites, apps, and partnerships with other brands.
While some people are concerned by Google’s increasing control over the internet, the company is known for prioritizing user privacy and treating its employees rather well. In fact, Google has been named one of the best companies to work for several times now – something that’s almost unheard of in the tech industry.
Google’s growth is helping to shape the future of the internet as a whole. Thanks to its use of WCMS software, Google is constantly creating new websites and apps that are highly interactive and enjoyable for users.
## Facebook

Facebook is the most popular social media website in the world, with approximately 2.3 billion users as of June 2018. The social media giant made headlines in the past year thanks to its data breach scandal, which saw personal information being accessed illegally by third parties.
With the controversy and data breach still fresh in people’s minds, the future of Facebook remains uncertain. Many users have been deleting their accounts, and it’s unclear whether they will ever come back.
Not only does Facebook have a lot of control over the internet, but it also has a huge influence on people’s lives. Some have argued that the social network is addictive and can damage the mental health of its users.
More recently, Facebook has been trying to diversify its business model. The company has been investing in new technologies, such as virtual reality, that will help it remain relevant in the future.
## Twitter

Twitter is a social networking website that allows users to post short “tweets,” or microblog posts, of up to 280 characters. A lot of celebrities and public figures use Twitter as a primary form of communication with fans, and it’s also a useful tool for journalists.
With more than 335 million monthly users, Twitter is certainly a significant platform for news and communication. The site has also been around for close to a decade, making it one of the oldest social media websites.
While Twitter’s future seems secure and only likely to grow, some have questioned whether the site’s microblogging format will remain relevant in the long run. It’s possible that future generations could prefer to communicate in a different way, perhaps through artificial intelligence or a new form of short-form video content.
## Amazon

Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer and marketplace, as well as a popular cloud computing service. The majority of its revenue comes from selling physical and digital products, though the company also offers paid memberships and other subscription services.
Like Google, Amazon is expanding rapidly and branching out into new fields. The company’s AWS services are used by many other websites and apps, and it has also been investing in artificial intelligence research.
Amazon has also been involved in a number of controversies, including hosting content that promotes hate speech and selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. It’s unclear how the future of the internet will play out with the retail giant playing such a prominent role.
## Microsoft

Microsoft is one of the oldest tech companies in the world, though its popularity began waning over a decade ago as the new frontier of the internet took shape. Recently, the company has made a comeback, re-inventing itself as a cloud computing provider and developing popular artificial intelligence technology.
The company’s Azure services are used by websites and apps around the globe, and Microsoft is also working on a new browser engine that’s meant to replace the current dominant one, called HTML5.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, it’s important to remember that the internet is a vast and complicated system that is constantly changing and evolving. New technology and new companies will rise and fall, and the future of the internet will be shaped by all of these factors in various ways.
Beyond this, the internet is an information exchange that connects millions of people across the globe. It has allowed people to communicate freely and collaborate on a scale never seen before in human history.
At the same time, it has also given rise to misinformation and fake news. While no one can predict what the future of the internet will look like, one thing is certain: it will be a fascinating place.
