An \"object\" is a combination of code and data, usually represented as a data structure, that performs some useful function. In object-oriented programming, we collect all the related code and data for a specific \"object\" into one computer file, and then create as many instances of that file as we need for our program. Each instance is called an \"object\" and has its own data fields and performs its own functions.\nDifferent programming languages have different rules for the types of objects you can create and how you create and use them. In Java, the most popular language for web development, all code must be contained in a class. A class is a type of object that contains fields and methods that perform some function. Java classes must follow specific rules to be considered \"object-oriented\". These rules are covered in this article.`),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"Object Oriented Programming With Java\"),mdx(\"p\",null,'Java is an object-oriented programming language.

Fields - A field is a variable declared in a class that can store data for the object. Constructors - A class can have multiple constructors.
