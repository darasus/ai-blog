summary: Investing is about building real, long-term wealth that can help you
  pay for your car, house, and retirement. The biggest mistake people make when
  they start investing is they try to pick stocks. Instead, focus on asset
  allocation. Asset allocation means you decide how much of your money you want
  to invest in different types of assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. The more
  you diversify your money, the lower the risk of losing money. Investing when
  you’re young can help earn compound interest over time and grow your money
  faster.
intro: People have many different reasons for saving money. Some are very frugal
  and use every spare penny to pay down debt, buy a home, or fund retirement
  plans. However, many people simply stash away their cash in a bank account
  hoping it will grow over time. While this is the tried-and-true method of
  savings, it won’t help you get rich. To grow your wealth instead of simply
  preserving it, you need to invest your cash and work on growing that money
  over time. Even if you’re young and have an extended road toward retirement
  ahead of you, there are still smart investing strategies that can help you
  build wealth sooner rather than later. Investing isn’t complicated; even with
  its fancy words like “asset allocation” and “beta coefficient.” Here are some
  helpful investing tips to get started...

## Know the difference between investing and speculation

Investing is the long-term buying and holding of assets with the goal of increasing their value over time. Speculation is the short-term buying and selling of assets in hopes of getting rich quickly. Investing is a process, while speculation is a mindset. While both processes can yield profits, successful investing requires a longer-term strategy and patience. Speculation, on the other hand, often involves risky high-return bets that can lead to quick profits or losses. Investing is about building real, long-term wealth that can help you pay for your car, house, and retirement. Speculation is about gambling and getting lucky. It can lead to quick riches, but is also just as likely to lead to quick losses.

## Asset allocation is key

The biggest mistake people make when they start investing is they try to pick stocks. Don’t be one of them. Instead, focus on asset allocation. The biggest mistake people make when they start investing is they try to pick stocks. Don’t be one of them. Instead, focus on asset allocation. Asset allocation means you decide how much of your money you want to invest in different types of assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. The more you diversify your money across different types of assets, the lower the risk of losing money. That’s because if one type of investment loses value, you can rely on the others to make up for it. This is particularly helpful as you get older and closer to retirement. Why? Because if one type of investment loses value (say, the stock market crashes), you have other sources of income you can rely on to fund your retirement. This can be an especially smart strategy if you’re young and have time on your side. If you invest, then see the market drop and panic and sell, you may have missed out on an opportunity for long-term growth.

## Three easy ways to invest your money

If you’re just starting to invest, you can use one of three low-risk strategies. You can buy individual stocks. This is a good way to get started investing, but you need to be careful since one wrong move can cost you a lot of money. 

 You can also buy a basket of stocks called a “mutual fund.” This is a collection of stocks that experts pick for you. 

Or you can put your money in a “index fund.” This is a type of mutual fund that tracks a certain index, like the S&P 500. 

When you choose one of these strategies, you’ll also need to decide on an investment strategy. This includes how long you plan to invest for, how much risk you’re willing to take with your money, and your investment goals.

## You’re not too young to invest

While teens and college students may cringe at the thought of investing, now is the time to get started. You may not have much cash to put toward your investments, but every little bit helps. Start out small and work your way up. You can also join a program like Robin Hood, which is a free stock-trading app that lets you start with as little as $100. Investing when you’re young can help you earn compound interest over time and grow your money much faster than if you start investing when you’re older. This is because as you get older, you have more responsibilities, like a mortgage, car payments, and maybe even kids. These expenses can eat up your cash and make it more difficult to save. When you’re young, though, you likely don’t have those same expenses. This means you have more cash on hand to put toward investments.

## Help! I’m afraid of investing my money.

If you’re afraid of losing money by investing it in the stock market, there are a few ways you can play it safe. You can invest in low-risk, low-return investments like certificates of deposit (CDs) or savings accounts. You may not see a lot of growth on these accounts, but at least you won’t lose money if the market takes a dive.

You can also invest in safer stocks. Look for companies in industries that are less risky, like utilities. You can also diversify your money across many different stocks. This way, if one company’s stock goes down, you have other investments to fall back on.

## The bad news: Taxes, fees and bumps along the road

Investing can be a lucrative way to build wealth, but it also comes with some downsides. One big downside is taxes. The government taxes capital gains, the profit you make when you sell an investment after it has gone up in value. The tax rate on capital gains can vary depending on how long you hold your investment. If you sell it after one year, the tax rate is usually the same as your ordinary income tax rate. After one year, your investment is also subject to the paid taxes, fees and bumps along the road. If you sell it after one year, the investment company will deduct a fee for transferring the money into your bank account. And some investments may also have additional fees. Be sure to look for investments that don’t charge fees. Also, be prepared for bumps along the road. Even the best-laid plans may face some bumps like a market correction or economic downturn that may temporarily drop the value of some investments. Don’t let a little turbulence get in the way of your investment strategy. Stick to your long-term plan, and you’ll likely see gains over time.

## Bottom line

Investing is a long-term strategy, not a quick way for rich quick. You may not see returns for years or even decades, but if you stay the course and ride out the market’s ups and downs, you can build significant wealth over time. 

That’s why it’s crucial to start investing early in your career. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. Remember, investing isn’t about getting rich quick. It’s about growing your money over time so that it’s there to fund your future goals, like retirement and sending your kids to college.
